## 1. API Description

Domain name for API request: mariadb.tencentcloudapi.com

This API (CreateAccount) is used to create database accounts. Multiple accounts can be created for one instance. The same user name with a different host represents a different account.

Default request rate limit: 20/sec.

Note: This API supports Finance regions. Finance and non-Finance regions are isolated from each other. Therefore, if the common parameter Region is a Finance region (such as ap-shanghai-fsi), you need to specify a domain name containing the Finance region specified in the Region field, for example: mariadb.ap-shanghai-fsi.tencentcloudapi.com.
