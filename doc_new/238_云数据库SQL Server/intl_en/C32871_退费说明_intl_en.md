### Return Policy
- A prepaid TencentDB for SQL Server instance can be returned within 5 days after purchase by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application. After the ticket is successfully submitted, Tencent Cloud customer service will process your application within 2 business days. You can track your refund order generated after the return is completed.
- **One** instance can be returned for no reason within 5 days after purchase. Only 1 chance is provided for an account.
- Prepaid resources that were originally pay-as-you-go cannot be returned.
- Tencent Cloud has the right to reject the application if the return is deemed abnormal or malicious.

#### Refund Amount
- Non-discount orders: The actual payment (including cash, bonus, voucher, and rebate, and excludes coupons) will be refunded to your Tencent Cloud account. Coupons will not be refunded.
- Discounted orders: The fees for the consumed resources are calculated at the non-discounted original price and deducted from the refund, and the remaining amount is refunded.

## Note
Before returning an instance, please check whether the conditions above are met first and make sure that your data has been migrated, as the system will clear the returned TencentDB resources immediately after the return is completed.
