- You can also choose auto-renewal in **User Center** > **Renewal Management** > **TencentDB for SQL Server** > **Items to Be Renewed**.

## Upgrade Fee
Upgrade fee = (price of target specification - price of original specification) x remaining validity period
>?
- You can only upgrade an instance to a higher specification. Downgrade is not supported.
- You cannot cancel the upgrade process once it has started.

## Renewal Fee
Renewal fee = Monthly price of instance x renewal period (month) + (monthly price of instance/30 x renewal period (day))
>? The renewal fee for a period less than a month is calculated based on monthly price and the number of days to renew.
For example, if an instance with a monthly price of 8.87 USD will expire on April 5 and you want to renew it to May 20, then the expiration date will be adjusted to the 20th day of each month, and the renewal fee will be 13.31 USD (8.87 + 8.87 รท 30 ร 15).
