If you do not pass the verification when you choose manual DNS verification, you can troubleshoot the problem through self-diagnosis:

### 1. Check the domain name status
Make sure the domain name can be properly resolved. For domain names without identity verifications, domain names just purchased, or others, the resolution may fail.

### 2. Check the DNS Server
Make sure you have added the resolution at the correct resolution provider. For example, if DNS server is a Wanwang server, it will not work to add TXT resolution in Tencent Cloud DNS.

### 3. Check resolution records
With the domain name properly resolved and the resolution added in the correct resolution service provider, if you still do not pass the verification, the server names, record values and so on may be mistakenly entered. If the TXT records are added completely, please wait for 24 hours.
