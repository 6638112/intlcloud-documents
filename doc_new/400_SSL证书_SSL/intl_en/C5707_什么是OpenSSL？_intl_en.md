3. Open the command line program cmd (run as an administrator), enter the directory where 2_www.domain.com.key and 1_www.domain.com_cert.crt are stored, and run the command below
```
openssl pkcs12 -export -out www.domain.com.pfx -inkey 2_www.domain.com.key -in 1_www.domain.com_cert.crt
```
For example, the key and crt files are stored in D:\ and the operation is as follows:
