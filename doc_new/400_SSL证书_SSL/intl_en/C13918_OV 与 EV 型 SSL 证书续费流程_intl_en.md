Renewing an SSL certificate is equivalent to applying for a new certificate in the console, so you need to install and deploy the new certificate to the server. The new certificate does not affect the normal use of the existing one.
> ! If you need to modify the certificate information, please apply for a new one.

## Advantages of Renewal
Renewing the existing certificate shows the following advantages over purchasing a new one:    
### Simplified renewal procedure
Instead of entering the application information again, you only need to confirm the original certificate's application data pulled automatically by the system to enter the payment process. After making the payment, please upload the confirmation letter and wait for certificate review.   
### Extra-prolonged certificate validity after renewal
After renewal, the unused time of the original certificate and a complimentary period of 1 to 90 days will be added to the validity of the new certificate. You will not suffer any loss in terms of certificate validity period due to renewal.   
 
## Certificate Renewal Procedure

### 1. Enter the certificate renewal entry
(1) For a paid OV/EV certificate, the fast renewal option will become available 3 months before its expiration date. You can open the fast renewal window by clicking **Fast Renewal** in the "Status" column of the certificate in the certificate list in the [SSL Certificate Service Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl).

(2) In the SSL certificate renewal prompt page, confirm the information and click **Go to Renewal** to enter the renewal page.

### 2. Confirm the renewal information and make the payment

(2) After confirming the information, you can select the renewal period and click **Quick Pay** to enter the payment process.
