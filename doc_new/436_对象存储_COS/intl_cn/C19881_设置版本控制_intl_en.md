## Overview
With versioning, you can store multiple versions of an object in a bucket and retrieve, delete, or restore a specified version. This can help you recover from data loss caused by accidental deletion or application failure.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5) and click **Bucket List** in the left sidebar to enter the bucket list page.
2. Click the bucket to be configured to enter the bucket details page.
