The maximum number of ENIs that can be bound to a CVM and the maximum number of private IPs allowed for a single ENI vary with CPU and memory configurations. You can check the details below. For use limits of other VPC products, please [see here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/38959).
>- The number of private IPs bound to a single ENI indicates the maximum number allowed. The EIP quota is not provided based on this upper limit but based on EIP [use limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733).
>- The number of ENIs indicates the number of ENIs that can be bound to a CVM. However, CVM instances in the same VPC can bind up to 1,000 ENIs.
