Tencent Cloud Flow Logs (FL) provides you with a full-time, full-flow, and non-intrusive ENI traffic collection service, enabling you to store and analyze network traffic in real time for assistance with troubleshooting, compliance auditing, architecture optimization, and security detection. With FL, your cloud networks will become more stable, secure, and intelligent.

With VPC flow logs, you can capture inbound/outbound ENI IP traffic in VPC. After a flow log is created, you can view and search for its data in [CLS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). You can also publish specified flow logs to other Tencent Cloud products for analysis or storage; for example, you can publish a flow log to a COS bucket to manage its lifecycle to meet the need for log audit.

>The FL service is currently in beta test. If you want to try it out, please submit an application for beta eligibility.
