Tencent Cloud Flow Logs (FL) provides a full-time, full-flow and non-intrusive ENI traffic collection service, enabling you to store and analyze network flow in real time for troubleshooting, compliance auditing, architecture optimization, and security detection. With FL, your cloud networks will become more stable, secure, and intelligent.

FL comes with the following features:
- Its flow logs allow you to capture inbound/outbound ENI IP traffic in VPC.
- After a flow log is created, you can view and search for its data in [Cloud Log Storage (CLS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). You can also publish specified flow logs to other Tencent Cloud products for analysis or storage; for example, you can publish a flow log to a COS bucket to manage its lifecycle.
