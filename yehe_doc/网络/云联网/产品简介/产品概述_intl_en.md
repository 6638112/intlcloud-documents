## What is Cloud Connect Network
Cloud Connect Network (CCN) bridges between Tencent Cloud [VPCs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535) and between VPCs and local IDCs. It provides you with public and private network multi-point interconnection, route self-learning, linkage prioritization, failure fast convergence, and other capabilities. With its presence in over 20 regions around the world, 100+ Gbps bandwidth and 99.99% high availability, it helps you easily build fast, stable, secure, and flexible globally interconnected networks. CCN is typically used in:
1. **High-quality private network connection between VPCs**: online education with real-time audio and video systems across regions, game acceleration using private network interconnection across regions, and cross-region disaster recovery.
2. **Private network connection between VPCs and on-premises IDCs**: create a [dedicated tunnel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216) and connect multiple VPCs for public and private network interconnection by a single access. Ideal for hybrid clouds.

## Product Components
A CCN consists of:
- Associated network instances: network instances within the same CCN instance can communicate with each other. Supported network instance types include VPC, VPC (BM), and direct connect gateway. For more information, refer to [Associate Network Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).
>? The VPN gateway associated with CCN is now in beta test. To apply for its use, [Submit a Ticket] (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).For more information, see [Connecting IDC to CCN via VPN Gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/36018).
- Route table: CCN automatically learns routes of network instances added and present them in its route table. For more information, see [Viewing Routing Information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30066).


## Feature Overview
CCN has the following features:
#### Full-mesh interconnection
CCN features multi-node multi-route-level automatic forwarding and learning on the public and private network and route convergence in seconds, which allows you to interconnect all network instances with a simple step, and manage them easily.
#### Smart learning and scheduling
CCN frees you from the heavy route maintenance with its Full Mesh interconnection between multiple nodes and links in public and private networks. The smart scheduling system monitors the multi-layer network topology, routes, and traffic of the entire network to connect your local services to the nearest point and ensure interconnection using the shortest link.
#### Automatic route forwarding
CCN automatically learns multi-level routes, and updates the routing table if your network topology changes. This simple management replaces your extra manual configuration or updates, which in turn, greatly improves the scalability and OPS efficiency of your network.

## Feature Comparison
#### CCN vs peering connection/dedicated tunnel
Without CCN, if you want to interconnect multiple VPCs and your IDC with multiple VPCs, you need to establish one peering connection for each pair of VPCs and one dedicated tunnel between your IDC and each VPC. And then, you also need to make sure VPC and IDC IP ranges do not overlap. After establishing the connection, you must manage the route tables of instances and manually add routing policies to make it all work. 

On the other hand, doing the same with CCN would only require a CCN instance and adding all VPCs and the IDC to the CCN instance. After you add the instances to the CCN, it will automatically forward and learn all routes, saving you the hassle of manually configuring and managing the route tables of the instances.
