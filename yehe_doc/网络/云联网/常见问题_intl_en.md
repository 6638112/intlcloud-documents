### How is CCN billed?
- Intra-region interconnection between CCN instances is free of charge if the bandwidth is 5 Gbps or below. To request for a bandwidth greater than 5 Gbps, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
- Cross-region interconnection incurs fees. The actual bandwidth usage in each region per month is billed on monthly 95th percentile. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30053).

### How do I migrate a peering connection or a direct connect to CCN?
You can associate the network instance with the CCN instance and then implement smooth migration by disabling and re-enabling the related route. For more information, see [Best Practices](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30078).
