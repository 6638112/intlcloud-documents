Cloud Connect Network (CCN) is billed according to the interconnection bandwidth and supports two billing modes (monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go by monthly 95th percentile) and three service levels ([platinum, gold, and silver](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30217)).
You can choose the cost-effective billing plan that best suits your application requirements. For example, we recommend choosing pay-as-you-go by monthly 95th percentile - gold for real-time audio/video and game acceleration. For business data backup, we recommend choosing monthly subscription - silver.


## Billing
The following table compares the two billing modes.

The three CCN service levels are as follows:

| Service Level | Service Availability       | Price Ratio        | Use Case  |
| :------- | :---------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Platinum   | 99.99%                   | 1.5                      | Suitable for business that requires extremely high communication quality, such as payment                           |
| Gold | 99.95%                     | 1                            | Suitable for business that requires moderately high communication quality, such as game acceleration                                  |
| Silver |  99.50% | 0.75 | Suitable for business that is cost-sensitive but less sensitive to communication quality, such as data backup  |

>?
>- You can test the network quality using the 10 Kbps of free bandwidth between regions.
>- Bandwidth of 5 Gbps or less in the same region (same account or cross account) is free of charge. There is no free quota for cross-region bandwidth. If you need more than 5 Gbps of bandwidth in the same region, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact us.
>- Cross-account and cross-region costs are paid by the account to which CCN instances belong.
>- This price ratio is for reference only. Please refer to the actual prices.


## Monthly Subscription
Pay for the fixed bandwidth (by month) before use. The unit price of monthly subscription is lower than that of pay-as-you-go by monthly 95th percentile, making it suitable for business that requires stable bandwidth.
For example, if you need 10 Mbps of bandwidth between Beijing and Shanghai regions, you need to first pay for 10 Mbps of bandwidth.

### Billing cycle
**Monthly subscription*: when purchasing fixed bandwidth (by month), you need to first pay for the fixed bandwidth.

### Billing formula
**Total CCN costs** = Sum of the interconnection costs of all regions

**Interconnection cost between two regions** = Total purchased period x (Unit price of the corresponding tier x Usage in each tier)

- **Unit price and usage**: progressive tiered pricing; usage in each tier is multiplied by the tiered price, and summed up for the total price.
- **Purchased period:** by month.

>- Please consult your sales rep for prices between regions outside the Chinese mainland and other regions.
>- Currently, monthly-subscribed CCN instance can be upgraded but not downgraded.
>- If the bandwidth between regions exceeds the purchased value, packets will be lost. We recommend configuring alarms.
>- The bandwidth limit has a 3-5% deviation. If you purchased 100 Mbps of bandwidth, packet loss may occur when the bandwidth reaches 95 Mbps or above.

### Billing example
Suppose your CCN (service level: gold) is associated with network instances in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai regions. The estimated bandwidth is as follows and requires 2 months of usage. You need to purchase two bandwidths: Guangzhou - Beijing and Beijing - Shanghai.
- Guangzhou - Beijing fees: 6,240 USD = 2 × (100 Mbps × 29 USD/Mbps/month + 20 Mbps × 11 USD/Mbps/month)
- Beijing - Shanghai fees: 1,740 USD = 2 × 30 Mbps × 29 USD/Mbps/month
The total upfront payment is: 7,980 USD.

## Pay-As-You-Go by Monthly 95th Percentile
Pay after use. Fees are charged based on the 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth and the proportion of valid days. Monthly pay-as-you-go billing is suitable for business with large bandwidth fluctuations.
For example, if you have 10 Mbps of bandwidth between Beijing and Shanghai regions but also a bandwidth burst of 30 Mbps. We recommend using pay-as-you-go by monthly 95th percentile because you may only need to pay for 10 Mbps of bandwidth after the top 5% is removed.
### Billing cycle
**Monthly pay-as-you-go**: fees are generated each month. You will be charged for the current month between 8 and 10 AM on the first day of the next month.

### Billing formula
**Total monthly cost of CCN** = Sum of the interconnection costs of all regions

**Monthly interconnection cost between two regions** = 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth of the interconnection between regions A and B × Proportion of valid days × Tiered unit price.

- **95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth:** acquired every 5 minutes. The peak bandwidth between two regions within 5 minutes is taken as a sample point. All sample points of the current month are sorted in descending order, and the top 5% are removed. The highest value of the remaining sample points is used as the 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth.
Suppose you used CCN in June to build cross-region connection between regions A and B for 14 valid days. Because one sample point is generated every 5 minutes, 288 (60 min × 24/5 min) sample points are generated every day, and 4,032 (14 days × 288 sample points/day) sample points are generated in 14 days. The bandwidth values of the 4,032 sample points are sorted in descending order, the top 5% (4,032 sample points × 0.05 = 201.6 sample points) are removed, and the bandwidth value of the 202nd sample point is used as the 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth.
- **Proportion of valid days:** proportion of valid days = Number of valid days in the current month / Number of days in the current month. A valid day refers to when at least one sample point has a bandwidth greater than 10 Kbps on that day.
- **Tiered unit price:** unit price of the tier into which the 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth falls.

>- Please consult your sales rep for prices between regions outside the Chinese mainland and other regions.
>- Pay-as-you-go CCN instances are billed by actual usage. To avoid paying for extra bandwidth, we recommend configuring bandwidth cap between regions.

### Billing example
Suppose your CCN (service level: gold) was associated with network instances in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Shanghai regions in June 2019. The bandwidth usage is as follows:
- Interconnection cost between Guangzhou and Beijing regions = 95th percentile of the monthly peak bandwidth value (120 Mbps) × Proportion of valid days (14/30) × Tiered unit price (13 USD/Mbps/month) = 728 USD.
- Interconnection cost between Beijing and Shanghai regions can be calculated using the above formula.
The final CCN cost generated in June is the sum of the interconnection costs of all regions.
