## Example of monthly top 5

### Fee calculation
For example, you use BWP for 20 valid days in June (including 30 days of the billed month), and sort the collected top 5 daily peaks in the month in descending order: 100 MB, 95 MB, 90 MB, 85 MB and 80 MB sequentially.

Monthly peak =（100 + 95 + 90 + 85 + 80) / 5 = 90 MB
BWP fee = 90 × 20 × 16.97 / 30 = 1,018.2 USD
The final fee is 1,018.2 USD, payable in early July.        

## Example of billing of monthly 95th percentile
### Fee calculation
For example, you use BWP for 20 valid days in June (including 30 days of the billed month) and the monthly 95th percentile peak is 120 MB.
BWP fee = 120 × 20 × 16.97 / 30 = 1,357.6 USD
The final fee is 1,357.6 USD, payable in early July.
