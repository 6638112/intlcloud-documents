This document describes how to delete a device bandwidth package under your bill-by-CVM account.

## Restrictions
After the device bandwidth package is deleted, all CVMs in this region will switch to bill-by-traffic. The bandwidth caps of these CVMs will be lowered to the [bandwidth cap of bill-by-traffic mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12523), if they're higher.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **Bandwidth Package** on the left sidebar.
3. Select the region, locate the bandwidth package you want to delete, and click **Delete** under its **Operation** column.
