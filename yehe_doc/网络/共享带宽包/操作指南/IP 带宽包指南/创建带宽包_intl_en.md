    2. In the **Operation** column, choose **More** -> **Adjustment network** to set the bandwidth cap.
 - To set a bandwidth cap for a CLB:
    1. Log in to the [Cloud Load Balancer Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb/index?rid=1&type=2%2C3).
    2. In the **Operation** column, choose **More** -> **Adjust Bandwidth** to set the bandwidth cap.
