## Peak Bandwidth
<table>
<tr>
<th width="19%">Peak Bandwidth</th><th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Single instance in BWP</td><td>The peak bandwidth of a single instance in the bandwidth package (such as public IP and CLB) is 2 Gbps. The peak bandwidth is only regarded as the maximum bandwidth for reference, and not as the committed bandwidth. When bandwidth resources are contested, the peak bandwidth may be limited.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Single region</td><td>The sum of peak bandwidth of all the running instances billed in bandwidth packages cannot exceed 50 Gbps in one region. If your application requires a guaranteed or higher bandwidth, contact your sales rep or <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a>. In this case, you need to pay the guaranteed bandwidth fee on a pro rata basis.</td>
