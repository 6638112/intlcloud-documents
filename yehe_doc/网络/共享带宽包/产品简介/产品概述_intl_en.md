Tencent Cloud Bandwidth Package (BWP) is a multi-IP aggregated billing method that significantly reduces Internet access costs. When public network instances have traffic peaks at different times, you can use BWP for the aggregated bandwidth billing to greatly save your public network fees.
BWP supports [monthly top 5 billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15255) and [monthly 95th percentile billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15255) for different use cases.
>?BWP is currently in beta. To try it out, please submit an application to be added to the beta list.

## Product Types
BWP consists of IP bandwidth package and device bandwidth package according to the billing object.
- **IP bandwidth package**: applies to accounts whose public network fess are billed on public IP or CLB, which mean that the public network capability (bandwidth cap) and billing method (bill-by-traffic or bill-by-bandwidth) are specified upon creation of the IP or CLB instance.
- **Device bandwidth package**: applies to accounts whose public network fees are billed on CVMs, which mean that the public network capability (bandwidth cap) and billing method (bill-by-traffic or bill-by-bandwidth) are specified upon creation of the CVM instance. The public IP address and CLB acts only as public network egress.
