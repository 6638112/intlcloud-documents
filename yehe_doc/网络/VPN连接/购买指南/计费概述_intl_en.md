## VPN Gateways
VPN gateways offers two billing options, pay-as-you-go and monthly subscription.
### Pay-as-you-go
The pay-as-you-go billing consists of two parts: traffic costs generated by public network access and gateway costs (calculated hourly).
- For traffic costs, see [Public Network Billing Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).

- For gateway costs, see the following table:

  | Gateways                           | Chinese Mainland | Hong Kong (China)        | Silicon Valley, Frankfurt, Seoul, Mumbai, Virginia, Moscow, and Tokyo | Toronto, Singapore, and Bangkok |
  | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
  | 5Mbps/10Mbps/20Mbps/50Mbps/100Mbps | 0.078 USD/hr  | 0.088 USD/hr | 0.088 USD/hr                                    | 0.12 USD/hr       |
  | 200Mbps/500Mbps/1000Mbps           | 0.46 USD/hr   | 0.62 USD/hr   | -                                                  | -                    |

#### Billing sample

Assume a user purchases 50 Mbps VPN gateway in Beijing with the pay-as-you-go billing option and uses a total of 5 GB traffic between 07:00:00-07:59:59, then at 08:00:00, the user will be required to pay the following fees:

- Traffic fee: the traffic price is 0.12 USD/GB in Beijing. Traffic fee = traffic price * used traffic = 0.12 USD/GB * 5 GB = 0.6 USD.
- Gateway fee: the price of 50 Mbps VPN gateway in Beijing region is 0.078 USD/hr. Gateway fee = gateway price * duration = 0.078 USD/hr * 1 hour = 0.078 USD.

Total fee = traffic fee + gateway fee = 0.6 USD + 0.078 USD = 0.678 USD.
