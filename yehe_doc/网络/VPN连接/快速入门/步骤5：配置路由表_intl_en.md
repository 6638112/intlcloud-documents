After you complete Step 4, the VPN tunnel is successfully configured. Next, you need to configure a route table to route the traffic of subnet A to the VPN gateway so that the IP range in subnet A can communicate with the IP range in the IDC.
1. Log in to the [Virtual Private Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Subnet**. Choose the region where your VPC resides and your VPC, i.e. **Guangzhou** and `TomVPC` in this example, and click the associated route table of the subnet A to go to the details page.
3. Click **+ New**.
4. In the **Create Route Table** pop-up window, enter the destination IP range (`10.0.1.0/24`). Select **VPN Gateway** for **next hop type**, and the new VPN gateway `TomVPNGw` for **next hop**.
>?If your local gateway is a customer gateway, repeat these steps to configure the routes for the local gateway.
