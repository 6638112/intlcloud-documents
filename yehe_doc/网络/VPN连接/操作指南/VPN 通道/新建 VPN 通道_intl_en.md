A VPN tunnel is an encrypted public network tunnel used to transmit data packets in a VPN connection. The VPN tunnel on Tencent Cloud uses the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol to establish a session when implementing IPsec. Featuring a self-protection mechanism, IKE can securely verify identities, distribute keys, and establish IPSec sessions on insecure networks. This document describes how to create a VPN tunnel on the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpnConn?rid=25).

The following configuration information is required to create a VPN tunnel:
+ [Basic information](#buzhou4)
+ [SPD (Security Policy Database) policy](#buzhou6)
+ [IKE configuration (Optional)](#buzhou7)
+ [IPsec configuration (Optional)](#buzhou8)

## Prerequisites
+ The VPN gateway and customer gateway have been configured.
+ The VPN gateway IP range and customer IP range cannot overlap.
+ The customer IDC must be configure with a static public IP.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **VPN Connection** > **VPN Tunnel** on the left sidebar to go to the management page.
3. Click **Create** on the **VPN Tunnel** management page.
4. Configure the basic information of the VPN tunnel in the pop-up dialog box.[](id:buzhou4)

5. Click **Next** to go to the **SPD Policy** configuration page.

6. Configure the SPD policy.[](id:buzhou6)
  >?
  >+ An SPD policy consists of a series of SPD rules to specify the IP ranges in a VPC or CCN and an IDC that can communicate with each other. Each SPD rule contains one VPN gateway CIDR block and at least one customer gateway CIDR block. A CIDR block and a customer gateway CIDR block form a mapping. An SPD rule may involve multiple mappings.
  >+ The rules for all tunnels of the same VPN gateway cannot contain overlapped mappings. In other words, the VPN gateway IP range and customer gateway IP range in a mapping cannot have a duplicate address range.
  >
**Example:**
As shown in the figure below, a VPN gateway has the following SPD rules:
 - SPD rule 1: the VPN gateway IP range is 10.0.0.0/24, and the customer gateway IP ranges are 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24. Two mappings are formed.
 - SPD rule 2: the VPN gateway IP range is 10.0.1.0/24, and the customer gateway IP range is 192.168.2.0/24. One mapping is formed.
 - SPD rule 3: the VPN gateway IP range is 10.0.1.0/24, and the customer gateway IP range is 192.168.2.0/24. One mapping is formed.
 There are four mappings as follows:
 - 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.0.0/24
 - 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.1.0/24
 - 10.0.1.0/24-----192.168.2.0/24
 - 10.0.2.0/24-----192.168.2.0/24
Note that the mapping rules cannot overlap with each other, which means that the VPN and customer gateway IP range of a rule cannot be both overlapped with the two corresponding IP ranges of another rule. 
 - Suppose that you want to add a new mapping between 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.1.0/24. The operation fails as the combination of VPN gateway IP and customer gateway IP already exists.
 - You can add a new mapping between 10.0.1.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24 as it does not overlap with any of the existing mappings.
