### Are There any Quota Limits for VPC instances, and How Many VPC Instances Can Be Created Under Each Account?
Some VPC resources are subject to usage quota limits. By default, up to five VPC instances can be created in each region under the same account.

### How Many EIPs Can Be Applied For by Each Account?
- Each Tencent Cloud account can apply for up to 20 EIPs in each region.
- The number of purchases that can be made by each Tencent Cloud account in each region per day is the doubled quota (that is, 40 times by default). When an EIP is unbound, the number of reassignments of public IP addresses that can be performed for free by each account per day is 10.
