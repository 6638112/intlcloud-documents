IP addresses support IPv4 and IPv6 addressing protocols. IPv4 is widely used, but the number of network addresses is limited, making IPv6 a good complement.

## IPv4 Addresses
Tencent Cloud provides IPv4 addresses for both the private and public network access. A public IPv4 address can be common or elastic. As shown in the following figure, **EIP** indicates an elastic IPv4 address, **Private** indicates a private IPv4 address, and **Public** indicates a public IPv4 address. These IPs will not change unless you unbind or change them.
>?Unless otherwise specified, private IP, public IP and EIP all refer to IPv4 addresses.

### Private IPv4 addresses
A private IPv4 address is used for Tencent Cloud private network access, which cannot be used to access the internet. Once a CVM instance is created, it will be automatically assigned with a private IPv4 address. The private IPv4 address can also be customized in a VPC environment.

#### Attributes
- The IPv4 private network is user-specific, and different users are isolated from each other. By default, cloud services of another user cannot be accessed via the IPv4 private network.
- The IPv4 private network is region-specific, and different regions are isolated from each other. By default, cloud services under the same account in a different region cannot be accessed via the IPv4 private network.

#### Use cases
The private IPv4 address can be used for:
- Interconnection between VPC-based or classic network-based CLB and CVM instances over an IPv4 private network.
- Interconnection between VPC-based or classic network-based CVM instances over an IPv4 private network.
- Interconnection between VPC-based or classic network-based CVM instances and other Tencent Cloud services (such as TencentDB) over an IPv4 private network.

#### Relevant operations
- For more information about how to obtain the private IPv4 address of the instance and set DNS, refer to [Getting Private IP Addresses and Setting DNS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17941).
- For more information about how to change the private IPv4 addresses of CVM instances in a VPC, see [Modifying Private IP Addresses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16561).

### Public IPv4 addresses
Tencent Cloud provides public IPs and EIPs for public network access. A CVM instance with a public IPv4 address can access and be accessed over an IPv4 public network.

#### Comparison
The following table compares public IPs with EIPs.

<tbody>
<tr>
<td colspan="2">Use cases</td>
<td>If you want to create a CVM that supports public network access, you can choose to use a public IP address automatically assigned by the system at the creation of a CVM instance. This public IP address has the same lifecycle as the CVM, and will be released upon the release of the bound CVM.</td>
<td>If you want to use a public IP for a long time, you can choose an elastic IP (EIP) and bind it to the specified CVM as needed. EIP can be bound or unbound many times, and will still exist after the CVM is released.</td>

#### Billing
The public network traffic generated by public IPv4 addresses will be charged with public network fees. For more information, see [Public Network Pricing](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/idc).
