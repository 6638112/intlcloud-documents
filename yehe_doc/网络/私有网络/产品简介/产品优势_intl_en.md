### Network Customization
VPC provides you with robust network management capabilities. VPC closely resembles a traditional network that you can select your own IP ranges, create subnets, and flexibly configure route tables and routing policies to deploy your cloud-based business in a custom fashion.
Tencent Cloud VPC also provides visualized network topologies to help you better plan the network.

### Scalability
You can benefit from the scalable network structure of VPC by connecting with local IDCs, other VPC instances, and classic networks, which help you achieve an elastic deployment as needed and reside businesses in different subnets of VPC instances.

### Rich Access Modes
VPC provides rich access modes to satisfy your demand for cloud-based communication:
- Access to the Internet: you can access the Internet using a public IP address, EIP, NAT Gateway, or CLB.
- Access to other VPC instances: you can access other VPC instances through CCN and peering connections.
- Access to local IDCs: you can access your local IDCs through VPN connections, Direct Connect, and CCN.
- Access to classic networks: you can access your business deployed in a classic network through Classiclink.

### Security and Reliability
Based on the tunneling technology, VPC constructs virtual networks on physical networks and uses the Overlay technology to achieve full private network isolation between VPC instances, providing you with independent, isolated, and secure cloud networks.
We also provide you with network access controls over a CVM in the VPC at different levels, including security groups and network ACLs.

### Ease of Use
You can create and manage VPC instances quickly and easily using the Console, APIs, or other methods. In addition, productized network features and rich troubleshooting features can greatly reduce your OPS costs.
