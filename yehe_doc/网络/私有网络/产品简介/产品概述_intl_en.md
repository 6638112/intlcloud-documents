A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a logically isolated network space. With VPC, you can configure logically isolated network space for your resources such as [CVMs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/495) and [cloud databases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236). This product provides better cloud resource security and can meet your needs in various scenarios.

This document introduces the core components, connection modes, and security of VPCs.
## Core Components
A VPC instance has three core components: VPC IP ranges, subnets, and route tables.
### VPC IP ranges
When you create a VPC, you need to specify a [CIDR (classless inter-domain routing) block](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/4925) as the VPCâ€™s IP address group.

Tencent Cloud VPC supports CIDR blocks in any of the following private IP ranges:
- **10.0**.0.0 - **10.255**.255.255 (**the mask range must be 16 to 28**)
- **172.16**.0.0 - **172.31**.255.255 (**the mask range must be 16 to 28**)
- **192.168**.0.0 - **192.168**.255.255 (**the mask range must be 16 to 28**)

### Subnets
A VPC is made up of at least one subnet. All cloud resources in a VPC (such as CVMs and cloud databases) must be deployed in a subnet, and the subnet CIDR block must be within the VPC CIDR block.

A VPC is set up at the [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31786) level (such as Guangzhou), while a subnet is set up at the [availability zone](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31786) level (such as Guangzhou Zone 1). You can divide a VPC into one or more subnets. Subnets in the same VPC can interconnect with one another by default, while subnets in different VPCs are isolated by default.

### Route tables
When you create a VPC, the system automatically generates a default route table to ensure that all subnets in the VPC interconnected. If the routing policies in the default route table cannot meet your business needs, you can create a custom route table.

For more information on route tables, see [Route Table Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31810).

## VPC Connections
Tencent Cloud provides a wide range of VPC connection solutions for different scenarios.
- CVMs and cloud databases in a VPC can connect to the Internet via Elastic IP and NAT Gateway.
- Peering Connection and Cloud Connect Network are used to enable communication between VPCs.
- VPCs and local IDCs are interconnected through VPN Connection, Direct Connect, and Cloud Connect Network. 


## VPC Security
A VPC is a logically isolated network space in the cloud. Different VPCs are isolated from each other to protect business security.
- Security group: a security group is a stateful virtual firewall capable of packet filtering. It controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level and is an important means of network security isolation.
- Network Access Control List (ACL): a network ACL is a stateless virtual firewall for filtering packets at the subnet level. It can be used to control the inbound and outbound data streams of subnets at the protocol and port granularity.
- Cloud Access Management (CAM): CAM helps you securely manage access to your Tencent Cloud resources. For example, CAM provides identity management and policy management so you can control who has access to your VPCs.
