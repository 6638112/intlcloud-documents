This document describes how to use Keepalived with [HAVIP](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31817) to build a high availability primary/secondary cluster in the Tencent Cloud VPC.
>?
>
>- HAVIP is currently in beta, and switching between primary/secondary servers may take 10 seconds. To try it out, please apply to be a beta user.

## Basic Principle
Typically, a high availability primary/secondary cluster consists of two servers: an active primary server and a standby secondary server. The two servers share the same VIP (virtual IP) which is only valid for the primary server. When the primary server fails, the secondary server will take over the VIP to continue providing services. This mode is widely used in MySQL source/replica switch and Ngnix web access.

Keepalived is a VRRP-based high availability software that can be used to build a high availability primary/secondary cluster among VPC-based CVMs. To use Keepalived, first complete its configuration in the `keepalived.conf` file.

- In traditional physical networks, the primary/secondary status can be negotiated with Keepalived’s VRRP protocol. The primary device periodically sends free-of-charge ARP messages to purge the MAC table or terminal ARP table of the uplink exchange to trigger the VIP migration to the primary device.
- In a Tencent Cloud VPC, a high availability primary/secondary cluster can also be implemented by deploying Keepalived on CVMs, with the following differences:
   - The VIP must be a [HAVIP](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31817) applied for from Tencent Cloud.
   - HAVIP is subnet-sensitive and can only be bound to a server under the same subnet through announcement.

## Notes
+ We recommend VRRP communications in unicast mode.
+ We recommend that you use Keepalived **1.2.24 or later versions**.
+ Ensure that the `garp` parameters have been configured. Because Keepalived relies on ARP messages to update the IP address, these configurations ensure that the primary device always sends ARP messages for the communication.
   ```plaintext
  garp_master_delay 1
  garp_master_refresh 5
  ```
+ Configure a unique VRRP router ID for each primary/secondary cluster in the VPC.
+ Do not use the strict mode. Ensure the “vrrp_strict” configurations have been deleted.
+ Control the number of HAVIPs bound to a single ENI to be no more than 5. If you need to use multiple VIPs, add or modify `vrrp_garp_master_repeat 1` in the “global_defs” section of the Keepalived configuration file.

## Directions

>!
>This document uses the following environments as an example. Please replace with your actual configurations.
>+ Primary CVM: HAVIP-01, 172.16.16.5
>+ Secondary CVM: HAVIP-02, 172.16.16.6
>+ HAVIP: 172.16.16.12
>+ EIP: 81.71.14.118
>+ Image: CentOS 7.6 64-bit

### Step 1: apply for VIP
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/).
2. Select **IP and ENI** > **HAVIP** in the left sidebar to enter the HAVIP management page. 
3. Select the relevant region on the HAVIP management page and click **Apply**.
4. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the name, select a VPC and a subnet for the HAVIP, and click **OK**.
>?The IP address of the HAVIP can be automatically assigned or manually specified. If you choose to enter an IP address, make sure that the entered private IP address is within the subnet IP range and is not a reserved IP address of the system. For example, if the subnet IP range is `10.0.0.0/24`, the entered private IP address should be within `10.0.0.2 - 10.0.0.254`.

### Step 2: install Keepalived (version 1.2.24 or later) on primary and secondary CVMs
This document uses CentOS 7.6 as an example to install Keepalived. If you require another image, contact our technical support team.
1. Run the following command to verify whether the Keepalived version meets the requirements.
   ```plaintext
   yum list keepalived
   ```
 + If yes, proceed to [step 2](#substep2)
 + If no, proceed to [step 3](#substep3)
2. <span id="substep2">Install the software package using the `yum` command.

   ```plaintext
   yum install -y keepalived
   ```

3. <span id="substep3">Install the software package using the source code.

   ```plaintext
   tar zxvf keepalived-1.2.24.tar.gz
   cd keepalived-1.2.24
   ./configure --prefix=/
   make; make install
   chmod +x /etc/init.d/keepalived   // Prevent occurrence of env: /etc/init.d/keepalived: Permission denied
   ```

### Step 3: configure Keepalived, and bind HAVIP to the primary and secondary CVMs.
1. Log in to the primary CVM HAVIP-01 and run `vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` to modify its configurations.

   ```plaintext

   ```

2. Press **Esc** to exit the edit mode and enter **:wq!** to save and close the file.

3. Log in to the secondary CVM HAVIP-02 and run `vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf` to modify its configurations.

   ```plaintext

           }
       track_script {
          checkhaproxy 
       }
   }
   ```

4. Press **Esc** to exit the edit mode and enter **:wq!** to save and close the file.

5. Restart Keepalived for the configuration to take effect.

   ```plaintext
   systemctl start keepalived
   ```

6. Check the primary/secondary status of the two CVMs, and confirm that both have HAVIP correctly bound.
>?In this example, HAVIP-01 has a higher priority and will normally serve as the primary node.
>
Log in to the [HAVIP](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/havip) console. You will see that HAVIP is bound to the primary CVM HAVIP-01, as shown below.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1104e6a7305dec04ce1ea242db0c2c8c.png)

### Step 4: **bind an EIP to HAVIP (optional)**  

1. Log in to the [HAVIP](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/havip) console, locate the HAVIP you have applied for in [Step 1](#step1), and click **Bind**.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/129cd10051b4d07e1d420b1bec710614.png)
2. In the pop-up dialog box, select the EIP to be bound and click **OK**. If no EIP is available, first go to the [EIP](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/eip?rid=46) console to apply.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8ca21593889529f42af52c5b68ec2f78.png)

### Step 5: use notify_action.sh for simple logging (optional)
The Keepalived’s main logs are still recorded in “/var/log/message”, and you can add the “notify” script for simple logging.

1. Log in to the CVM and run the `vim /etc/keepalived/notify_action.sh` command to add the following “notify_action.sh” script.

   ```plaintext
   #!/bin/bash
   #/etc/keepalived/notify_action.sh
   log_file=/var/log/keepalived.log
   log_write()
   {
       echo "[`date '+%Y-%m-%d %T'`] $1" >$log_file
   }
   
   [ ! -d /var/keepalived/ ] && mkdir -p /var/keepalived/
   
   case "$1" in
       "MASTER" )
           echo -n "$1" /var/keepalived/state
           log_write " notify_master"
           echo -n "0" /var/keepalived/vip_check_failed_count
           ;;
   
       "BACKUP" )
           echo -n "$1" /var/keepalived/state
           log_write " notify_backup"
           ;;
   
       "FAULT" )
           echo -n "$1" /var/keepalived/state
           log_write " notify_fault"
           ;;
   
       "STOP" )
           echo -n "$1" /var/keepalived/state
           log_write " notify_stop"
           ;;
       *)
           log_write "notify_action.sh: STATE ERROR!!!"
           ;;
   esac
   ```

2. Run the `chmod a+x /etc/keepalived/notify_action.sh` command to modify the script permission.

### Step 6: verify whether VIP and public IP are switched normally during primary/secondary switch

Simulate the CVM failure by restarting the Keepalived process or restarting the CVM to check whether the VIP can be migrated.

- If the primary/secondary switch succeeds, the secondary CVM will become the server bound with the HAVIP in the console.
- You can also ping a VIP from within the VPC to check the time lapse from network interruption to recovery. Each switch may cause an interruption for about 4 seconds. If you ping the EIP bound to HAVIP over a public network, the result will be the same.
