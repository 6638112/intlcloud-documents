You can delete the route table that is not associated with any subnet. You can only delete custom route tables, not the default route table automatically generated by the system.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/route?rid=1), and select **Route Tables**.
2. In the list, select the route table to delete. Click **Delete** in the **Operation** column.
