[Elastic IP (EIP)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733): an EIP is a static IP address designed for dynamic cloud computing. It is also a public IP address that remains unchanged in a region. By using EIPs, you can quickly remap an address to another instance or a NAT gateway instance under your account to shield instance failures.

For the step-by-step operations of EIPs, see [EIPs - Steps](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16586).
