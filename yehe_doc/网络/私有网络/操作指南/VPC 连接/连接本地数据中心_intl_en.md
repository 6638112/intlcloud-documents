You can establish a VPN connection, direct connection, or CCN to implement communication between your VPC instances and local IDCs.
## VPN Connections
[VPN connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037) is a method for connecting your IDCs and VPC instances through public network encrypted tunnels. A VPN connection consists of three parts: VPN gateway, customer gateway, and VPN tunnel.
Each VPN gateway can establish multiple VPN tunnels, and each VPN tunnel can connect to one local IDC.
