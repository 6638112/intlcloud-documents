Each subnet must be associated with one [route table](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31810), which is used to control the outbound traffic direction of the subnet. You can change the Subnetâ€™s associated route table in the **VPC -> Subnet** page according to the routing needs of the subnet. If you need to create a route table, please see [Creating a Custom Route Table](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/35236).

## Systems impact
Considering that the route table directly impacts the traffic flow in the subnet, any changes such as route table association or route entries must be carefully considered in accordance to the business needs of the network flows.

## Directions

2. Select **Subnet** in the left sidebar to go to the subnet management page.
