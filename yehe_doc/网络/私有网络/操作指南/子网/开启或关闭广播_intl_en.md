## Background
Multicast and broadcast are modes of one-to-many communication, which can help enterprises reduce network bandwidth consumption and network load through point-to-multipoint efficient data transmission.
If unicast is used, the sending server needs to separately send to N servers for total N times. If multicast is used, the server sends the same data to N servers only once, which reduces server resource consumption and also bandwidth resources of the backbone network.
- Multicast: Tencent Cloud supports multicast on the VPC dimension.
- Broadcast: Tencent Cloud supports broadcast on the subnet dimension.

>? The broadcast and multicast features are currently in beta. If you do need to use them, please submit an application.

## Overview
Multicast and broadcast are mostly used in the financial and game industries:
- Broadcast services or market data of the financial industry. For example, after obtaining stock prices and other real-time data, brokers can broadcast stock data to multiple clients in real time, effectively reducing network load.
- For the game industry, broadcast and multicast are mainly used for heartbeat holding between multiple servers.

This document describes how to enable or disable broadcast for subnets.
