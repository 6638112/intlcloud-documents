A [NAT gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1015) is a service that supports IP address translation and provides SNAT and DNAT capabilities. It can provide secure, high-performance Internet access service for resources in the VPCs. For example, it can provide the security egress for public network access for multiple CVMs without public network access capabilities.
