A [NAT gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1015) is a service that supports IP address translation and provides SNAT and DNAT capabilities. It can provide secure, high-performance Internet access service for resources in the VPCs. For example, it can provide a secure egress, accessing the public network for multiple CVMs which donâ€™t already have an access to the public network (Internet).
