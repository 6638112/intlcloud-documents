## Operation Scenario
If your business no longer needs one or multiple security groups, you can delete them. After you delete a security group, all security group rules in the group will also be deleted.

## Prerequisites
The security group to be deleted is not associated with any instances. If it is associated with instances, remove them from the security group first. Otherwise, the security group cannot be deleted. For details about the operation, see [Removing from a Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/35508).

## Steps

1. Log in to [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. In the left sidebar, click **[Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup)** to enter the security group management page.
3. On the security group management page, choose **Region**, and locate the row of the security group to be deleted.
4. In the operation column, click **More** > **Delete**.
5. In the window that appears, click **OK**.
