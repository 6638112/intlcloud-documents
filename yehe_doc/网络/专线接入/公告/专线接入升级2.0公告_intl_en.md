Dear Tencent Cloud user,
Note that some network devices will reach End of Service (EOS) on December 31, 2021, and your Direct Connect instances may be affected accordingly. To provide you with a more stable and quality Direct Connect service, Tencent Cloud schedules an upgrade of the affected service during August 1 and December 31, 2021 (Beijing time), and helps migrate your business to new network devices in batches.


## Upgrade Process

1. Tencent Cloud technical personnel will discuss the business scenario with you and develop a migration plan for you.
2. Tencent Cloud technical personnel will work with you to assess your business and determine the migration time with the least impact on your business.
3. [Apply for a connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19244) on the Tencent Cloud Direct Connect console. Your application will be reviewed in about 1-3 business days.
4. Tencent Cloud technical personnel will help you migrate lines as instructed by the migration plan during the agreed-upon period.
If the direct migration is impossible due to a long distance between the obsolete device and the new one, you need to contact the connection provider to adjust or redeploy the connection.
>? Starting from July 30, 2021, 00:00:00, Tencent Cloud Direct Connect stops accepting new ticket for connecting with BM 1.0 and dedicated tunnel.
>
5. After the migration is completed, test and debug your business to ensure the normal operation.
6. After the business runs normally, abolish the old connection and delete the old dedicated tunnel.

## FAQs

### Will the connection newly applied for on the console incur fees?
Users who complete the business migration before December 31, 2021, will be exempted from the port fee arising from the migration.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
During the migration period, the old port will not be charged with a monthly fee, while the new port will still be billed the same as the original port. For more information, contact the Tencent Cloud technical support team. The old port will be abolished after the migration.

### What are the risks if I donâ€™t migrate my business? 
Since these network devices reach their EOS dates, continued use of them will have greater operational risk, and even cause business failure and slow recovery.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Tencent Cloud no longer provides SLA assurance for relevant Direct Connect instances if the connection migration is not completed after December 31, 2021.
</dx-alert>


### Will the cost increase if I change a cross-region tunnel to the cross-region CCN connection?
Both services adopt monthly 95th percentile billing and tiered pricing. You can choose either service that suits your actual use case. The CCN service is more cost-effective. For its price details, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30053).
