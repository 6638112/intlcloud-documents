Dedicated tunnel exception information at the tunnel linkage level can be reported. When a tunnel linkage under your account is exceptional (for example, transfer over the connection linkage is interrupted or exceptional, BGP session is disconnected, the number of BGP session tunnel routes exceeds the limit, or BFD is interrupted), the exception information will be reported to Cloud Monitor. After the exception is recovered, the event status will be updated accordingly.
