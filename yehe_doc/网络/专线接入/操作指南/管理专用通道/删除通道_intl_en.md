>To ensure that the businesses of tunnel users work properly, users can only change the bandwidth of tunnels but not delete tunnels.

1. Log in to the [Direct Connect console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/dcConn).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Dedicated Tunnels** to go to the management page.
3. Locate the dedicated tunnel to delete. Then, click **Delete** and confirm.
4. You cannot create another dedicated tunnel with the same VLAN ID before the current tunnel is successfully deleted.
