    1. Fill in **Policy Name** and **Remarks**. Select **Physical Dedicated Line**, **Dedicated Line Channel** or **Direct Connect Gateway** for **Policy Type** as needed.
    2. Choose a project based on your needs. Each project supports creating a maximum of 300 alarm policies.
    3. Select the alarm object.
    - If you check **All Objects**, the alarm policy will be associated with all instances under the current account.
    - If you check **Select some objects**, the alarm policy will be associated with the selected instances.

    4. Use one of the following methods to configure the trigger condition.
