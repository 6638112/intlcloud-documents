This document describes how to create a direct connect gateway and provides information on the inbound route.

## Prerequisites
- You have applied for a connection as instructed in [Applying for Connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19244).
- You have built a VPC as instructed in [Building Up an IPv4 VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31891).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Direct Connect Gateway console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login/subAccount?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.tencent.com%2Fvpc%2Fdcgw%3Frid%3D1).
2. Select a region and VPC at the top of the **Direct Connect Gateway** page, and click **+New**.
3. Complete the configurations in the pop-up window and click **OK**.

## Inbound Routes
As shown in the Direct Connect network architecture, both the creation time of the direct connect gateway and dedicated tunnel mode will affect the destination of the inbound route (from your IDC to a Tencent Cloud VPC). For more information, please see [Direct Connect Gateway Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/38746).

## Subsequent Operations
- After you create a CCN-based direct connect gateway, you should also add IDC IP ranges to the direct connect gateway to implement network communication. For more information, see [Adding IDC IP Ranges to the Direct Connect Gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/39083).
- After you create a VPC-based direct connect gateway, you should also configure the VPCâ€™s route table to implement network communication. For more information, see [Configuring the Route Table](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19259).
