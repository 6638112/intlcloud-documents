When the system-assigned IP addresses are insufficient, you can apply for a public IP range in the console for Internet tunnel to meet your business requirements. This document describes how to apply for and manage public IP ranges.

## Public IP Range Lifecycle
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ebb4ee3321c34679d0970b95c6247dfb.svg)
1. [Apply for a public IP range](#creat): after your application is submitted in the console, a public IP range will be automatically assigned. The status of this public IP range will become “In use”.
2. A public IP range in use can be split or disabled.
   - [Split an IP range](#wdcf): applicable to the scenario requiring a refined IP range. The public IP range is still in use.
   - [Disable a public IP range](#tygw): the public IP range is disabled.
3. A disabled public IP range can be enabled or released.
   - [Enable a public IP range](#qygw): the public IP range reverts to the “In use” status.
   - [Release a public IP range](#thgw): the public IP range is released.
4. [Recover a public IP range](#refound): a public IP range that has been released in the last eight days can be recovered, which will be reassigned and resumed the “In use” status.

## Prerequisites
You have applied for an Internet tunnel as instructed in [Creating an Internet Tunnel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/39107).

<table>
<tr>
<th width="10%">Field</th>
<th>Description</th>

## Splitting IP Ranges
You can split IP ranges as follows if a refined IP range is required. To split IP ranges, ensure the mask of an IPv4 address is less than 30, and that of an IPv6 address is less than 64.
1. Log in to the [Direct Connect console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dc/dc) and choose **Internet Tunnels** > **Public IP Range** on the left sidebar.
2. Select a region at the top of the page
3. Locate the public IP range to be split, and click **Split IP Range** under the **Operation** column.
