Read this document to learn about the connection planning before  building a network architecture for Direct Connect.

## Background
A connection planning improves the stability and high availability of the network architecture for Direct Connect, and minimizes the impact from failures including device, port/fiber optic component, connection and data center at the access point. See the table below for the description and cause of failures.
<table>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Failure</th>
<th width="40%">Description</th>
<th width="40%">Cause</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Connection</td>
<td>The connection communication fails or many packets are discarded.</td>
<td>The connection is damaged. For example, the cable is cut off.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Port/fiber optic component</td>
<td>The port/fiber optic component fails to be read or has an transfer exception due to hardware or software failures.</td>
<td><ul><li>Hardware failure: incompatible version, contaminated or damaged port.</li><li>Software failure: incorrect port status, port in **UP** status without receiving or sending packets, frequent port on/off, or cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Network device</td>
<td>The exchange or router on the IDC side is unavailable.</td>
<td><ul><li>Hardware failure: power supply, port, component or cable failures.</li><li>Software failure: exchange/router error or incorrectly configured.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data center at the access point</td>
<td>The data center encounters network disconnection, or the access point is unavailable.</td>
<td>The data center cannot function normally due to earthquakes, fires or other disasters.</td>

## Planning Ideas
<span id="capacity"></span>
### Capacity panning
The capacity planning is designed to meet business bandwidth requirements at a reasonable cost and guarantee the business operation in the event of a connection failure. To achieve this, you can:
- Apply for connections twice your actual needs.
- Maintain the connection utilization (current peak bandwidth/connection bandwidth * 100%) 50% or less.

Assume your business needs 3 Mpbs of bandwidth, you can apply for two connections with 5 Mpbs of bandwidth to each Tencent Cloud access point, each connection will be used about 30%. If one connection faults, the business traffic will quickly switch to the standby connection to ensure the business continuity. After the switchover, the standby connection will be used about 60%. In this way, only the connection load temporarily increases, and the business data is unaffected.

### Expansion planning
The expansion planning is designed to meet the surging business demand at a reasonable cost. Depending on the expansion cycle, you need to plan differently as follows:
- If you need an urgent expansion, you can apply for a connection based on the estimated business bandwidth, so that you can adjust the bandwidth limit to maintain your business when the traffic surges.
- If you donâ€™t need an expansion in the near future, you can apply for a new connection based on your actual expansion needs. The expansion will take 2-3 months.
>? A single expansion exceeding 100 Gbps of bandwidth requires a longer period. Please develop an expansion plan in advance for high-bandwidth businesses.


### Disaster recovery planning
The disaster recovery is designed to improve the high availability of a network architecture and minimize the failure (including port/fiber optic component, network device, and data center at the access point) impact on business operations.
To avoid single points of failures, we recommend that you develop a disaster recovery plan for access points, physical lines, and hardware devices.
- Access point: the local IDC uses connections of different physical lines to two intra-region Tencent Cloud access points.
- Physical line: different physical lines provided by carriers are used to connect to a Tencent Cloud access point.
- Hardware devices: both network devices and fiber optic components have redundant backups.

Assume you connect your local IDC to two intra-region Tencent Cloud access points according to [capacity planning (#capacity) requirements, as shown in the figure below. If the connection to access point A is disconnected due to port/fiber optic component, network devices or data center failures, the business traffic will quickly switch to the connection to access point B, without losing business data or interrupting businesses.
