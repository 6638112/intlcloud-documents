> - Tencent Cloud accounts registered on and after June 17, 2020 are bill-by-IP. For Tencent Cloud accounts registered before June 17, 2020, please check the account types in the console. For more information, please see [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).
> - Bill-by-IP is an attribute at the account level. An account can only be bill-by-IP or non-bill-by-IP.

### Non-bill-by-IP Account
- For a non-bill-by-IP account, public network fees are charged by CVM, and CLB is only used as the public network egress. The public network billing mode and bandwidth upper limit are specified when the CVM instance is created, and no network billing configuration is available when the public network CLB instance is created.
- Under a non-bill-by-IP account, neither the purchase page nor the list page of the public network CLB instance contains the bandwidth information.


### Bill-by-IP Account
- For a bill-by-IP account, the public network fees are charged by the public IP or CLB instead of CVM. You can specify the public network billing mode and bandwidth upper limit in the public IP or CLB instance configuration.
- Under a bill-by-IP account, both the purchase page and the list page of the public network CLB instance contain the bandwidth information.
