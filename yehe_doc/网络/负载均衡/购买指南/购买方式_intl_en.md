Tencent Cloud allows you to create a CLB instance on the official purchase page or via API. The two methods are detailed below:

## Purchasing a CLB instance on the official purchase page
You can purchase a CLB instance on [Tencent Cloud official website](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb). There are two types of Tencent Cloud accounts, namely the bill-by-IP account and bill-by-CVM account. The accounts created after 00:00:00 on June 17, 2020 are of the bill-by-IP type. If you have created your account before that time, you can check your account type in the console as instructed in [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).
### Bill-by-CVM accounts
Private network CLB instances are free of charge, while public network CLB instances charge instance fees on an hourly pay-as-you-go basis. You can purchase public network on [CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/495). For more information on the network billing modes, please see [Public Network Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).
To purchase a CLB instance on the official website, perform the following:
1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud console and go to the [CLB purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb).
2. For the **Instance type**, **Cloud Load Balancer** is recommended.

4. Confirm and pay for the selected CLB instance.
5. CLB service will be activated once the payment completes. You can now configure and use the CLB instance.

### Bill-by-IP accounts
Private network CLB instances are free of charge. Public network CLB instances charge instance fees and public network fees on a monthly subscription or pay-as-you-go basis. The monthly-subscribed public network can only be billed by bandwidth, while the pay-as-you-go public network can be billed by bandwidth, traffic, and shared bandwidth package.
