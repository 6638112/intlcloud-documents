## TCP Listener
Layer-4 TCP listeners support three types of health checks, namely the layer-4 TCP health check, layer-7 HTTP health check, and custom protocol health check.
- TCP health checks are conducted with SYN packets, that is, TCP three-way handshakes are initiated to obtain the status information of backend CVM instances.
- HTTP health checks are conducted by sending HTTP requests to obtain the status information of backend CVM instances.
- Custom protocol health checks are conducted by customizing the input and output content of the application layer protocol to obtain the status information of backend CVM instances.

### Configuring TCP health check
1. Configure a listener to the step of **Health Check** as instructed in [Prerequisites](#postreq).
2. In the step of **Health Check**, select **TCP** as the protocol.
