CLB can be bound to CVM instances in different regions through CCN. You can select multiple regions of real servers for cross-VPC and cross-region binding.
This feature is currently in beta test. For cross-region binding in Mainland China, please submit a ticket for application. For cross-region binding outside Mainland China, please [contact your Tencent Cloud rep](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).
>?
>- Cross-region CVM instance binding is currently not supported for classic CLB.
>- This feature is available only to standard accounts. You can determine the account type as instructed in [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246#judge).


## Use Cases
1. This feature can meet the needs in unified cross-region server scenarios for gaming businesses such as P2P. For example, if your real server cluster is deployed in Guangzhou, you can create CLB instances in Shanghai and Beijing and bind them to the same real server cluster in Guangzhou for game acceleration and traffic convergence, effectively ensuring the quality of data transfer and reducing the latency.
2. This feature can meet the needs in financial business and payment scenarios by effectively ensuring the transfer quality and consistency of data in key businesses.

## Prerequisites
1. You have submitted the application for beta test eligibility. For cross-region binding in Mainland China, please submit a ticket for application. For cross-region binding outside Mainland China, please [contact your Tencent Cloud rep](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).
2. You have created a CLB instance. For more information, please see [Creating CLB Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149).
3. You have created a CCN instance. For more information, please see [Creating a CCN Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30062).
4. You have associated the target VPC to be bound with the created CCN instance. For more information, please see [Associating Network Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).


## Directions
1. Log in to the [CLB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/loadbalance).
2. On the instance details page, click the ID of the target CLB instance.
3. In the "Real Server" section on the "Basic Info" page, click **Configure** to bind a private IP not in the current VPC.

6. On the instance details page, click the "Listener Management" tab and bind a real server to the CLB instance in the "Configure Listener" section. For more information, please see [Adding real server to CLB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6156).
7. In the "Bind Real Server" dialog box that pops up, select "Other VPCs", click **CVM**, select one or multiple CVM instances to be associated with, enter the port and weight, and click **OK**. For more information, please see [Common Server Ports](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12451).
8. Return to the "Bound Real Servers" section and you can view the bound CVM instances in other regions.
