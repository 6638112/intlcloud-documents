## API Description
This API is used to clone all configurations of a CLB instance, including its attribute, security group, listener and real server bound.
Domain name for API calls: `lb.api.qcloud.com`
>!
- If there are many CLB configurations, the API tends to time out. Please wait patiently.
- The API does not support concurrent calls.
- Currently, a classic CLB instance cannot be cloned.
- All the cloned CLB instances are pay-as-you-go. The cloned ones will be automatically deleted once the clone fails.
- All the cloned CLB instances are named after “cloneFrom-lb-xxx” (a clone from the `lb-xxx` CLB instance).
