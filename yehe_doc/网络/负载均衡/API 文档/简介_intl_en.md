Welcome to Tencent Cloud Cloud Load Balancer (CLB). After a virtual IP address (VIP) is set for a CLB instance, the CLB instance distributes requests from clients to multiple intra-region real servers that are bound to the CLB instance by using the specified method.

CLB virtualizes multiple CVMs as an available cloud pool. It checks the health of CVMs in the cloud pool, and automatically isolates unhealthy CVMs, thus resolving a single point of failure (SPOF) of a CVM and improving the overall service capability of applications. In addition, CLB provides a protection capability of more than 300 Gbit/s against DDoS attacks. 

CLB is a solution that serves multiple machines simultaneously, and it must be used in combination with CVM.
