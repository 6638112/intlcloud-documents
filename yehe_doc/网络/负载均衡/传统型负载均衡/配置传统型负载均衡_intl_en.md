After creating a classic CLB instance, you need to configure a listener to it. The listener listens to requests on the instance and distributes traffic to real servers based on the load balancing policy.

## Prerequisites
You need to [create a CLB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149) first and select "Classic CLB" for **Instance type**.
>!All Tencent Cloud accounts registered after June 17, 2020 00:00:00 are bill-by-IP accounts which no longer support classic CLB. So you can only purchase a CLB instance.

## Configuring the Listener
### Step 1. Open the **Listener Management** page
1. Log in to the [CLB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb).
2. Select **Instance Management** on the left sidebar.
3. On the **Instance Management** page, click the ID/Name of the instance to be configured to enter the instance details page.
4. Select the **Listener Management** tab, or click **Configure listener** under the **Operation** column on the **Instance Management** page.

5. See the figure below for the **Listener Management** page.

### Step 2. Configure a listener
Click **Create** under **Listener** and configure a TCP listener in the pop-up window.
#### 1. Basic configuration

To create a TCP listener, complete the basic configuration as shown below:

#### 2. Advanced configuration
| Configuration Item | Description | Example |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Balance Method | For TCP listeners, CLB supports two scheduling algorithms: weighted round-robin (WRR) and weighted least-connection (WLC).<br><li>WRR: requests are sequentially forwarded to different real servers according to their weights. Scheduling is based on the <strong>number of new connections</strong>, where servers with higher weights have more polls (i.e., a higher probability), while servers with the same weight process the same number of connections.</li><li>WLC: loads on servers are estimated according to their number of active connections. Scheduling is based on server loads and weights. If their weights are the same, servers with fewer active connections will have more polls (i.e., a higher probability).</li> | WRR |
| Session Persistence | Whether to enable or disable session persistence.<br><li>If session persistence is enabled, the CLB listener will distribute access requests from the same client to the same real server.</li><li>TCP session persistence is implemented based on client IP address. The access requests from the same IP address are forwarded to the same real server.</li><li>Session persistence can be enabled for WRR scheduling but not WLC scheduling.</li> | Enabled |
| Hold Time | Session persistence time.<br><li>If there is no new request in the connection within the session persistence time, session persistence will be automatically disconnected.</li><li>Value range: 30-3600 seconds.</li> | 30s |

Complete the configuration as shown below:

#### 3. Health check
| Configuration Item | Description | Example |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Health Check | Whether to enable or disable health check. In TCP listeners, CLB instances send SYN packets to specified server ports to perform health checks. | Enabled |
| Check Protocol | To be added. | To be added |
| Check Port | To be added. | To be added |
| Response Timeout | <li> Maximum response timeout period for health checks.</li><li>If a real server fails to respond within the timeout period, it is considered unhealthy.</li><li>Value range: 2-60 seconds. Default value: 2s.</li> | 2s |
| Check Interval | <li>Interval between two health checks.</li><li>Value range: 5-300 seconds. Default value: 5s.</li> | 5s |
| Unhealthy Threshold | <li>If the health check returns `failure` for consecutive n times (n is user-defined), the real server is unhealthy, and displays the **unhealthy** status in the console.</li><li>Value range: 2-10 times. Default value: 3 times</li> | 3 times |
| Healthy Threshold | <li>If the health check returns `success` for consecutive n times (n is user-defined), the real server is healthy, and display the **healthy** status in the console.</li><li>Value range: 2-10 times. Default value: 3 times.</li> | 3 times |

Complete the configuration of the health check as shown below:

### Step 3. Bind a real server
Click **Bind** on the **Listener Management** page and select the real server to be bound in the pop-up window, as shown below:

Below is a screenshot after configuration:

>?If you configure multiple listeners to a classic CLB instance and bind multiple real servers, each listener will forward requests to all real servers according to its configuration.

### Step 4. (Optional) security group
You can configure a CLB security group to isolate public network traffic. For more information, see [Configuring a CLB Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733).

### Step 5. (Optional) modify or delete a listener
If you need to modify or delete an existing listener, select the listener on the **Listener Management** page and select **Modify** or **Delete**.
