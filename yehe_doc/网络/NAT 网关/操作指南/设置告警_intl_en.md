You can set an alarm for your NAT Gateway to monitor its status.
1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitoring Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview).
2. In the left sidebar, choose **Alarm Configuration** -> **Alarm Policy** to go to the **Alarm Policy** page, and then click **Add**.
3. Enter a name and remarks for the alarm policy. Select **NAT Gateway** for **Policy Type**. Configure the alarm object, triggering condition, and alarm channels. You can optionally input the URL that can be accessed by the public network as the callback API address, so Cloud Monitoring will push the alarm information to this address in time.

> To delete an alarm policy, you must first unbind all resources from it.

5. When the alarm condition is triggered, you will receive an alarm notification via SMS, email, or in Message Center according to the alarm channel you configured. You can also select **Alarm List** in the left sidebar to view alarms. For more information, see [Creating Alarm Policies](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/248/1073).
