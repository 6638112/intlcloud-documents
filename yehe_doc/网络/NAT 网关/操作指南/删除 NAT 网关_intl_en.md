> Deleting a NAT gateway also deletes the gatewayâ€™s routing table and all of its routing policies. This interrupts any requests to and from the public network. Therefore, make the necessary preparations in advance.

To delete a NAT gateway:
1. Log in to the [Virtual Private Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Locate the desired NAT gateway and click the corresponding **Delete** button. Click **Delete** again to confirm the operation.
