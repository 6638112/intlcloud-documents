To better demonstrate the features of IoT Hub, we have created a simple demo for the following smart home scenarios:
- Scenario 1: the door is connected with the air conditioner, and actions of entering/leaving the house are monitored through the door to instruct the air conditioner to turn on/off.
- Scenario 2: it describes how to set the air conditioner temperature and query the energy consumption of the air conditioner with an application.

The demo involves the following features of IoT Hub:
- Message publishing and subscribing
- Device shadow-based status reporting and configuration distribution
- Rule engine-based device message communication

You can refer to the demo for customization based on your own needs.
