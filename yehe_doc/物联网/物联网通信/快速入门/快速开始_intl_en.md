To get started quickly, you are advised to connect to IoT Hub using MQTT.fx. Find the connection guide as follows:

- [MQTT.fx Connection Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1105/41469)
- To use sites other than Chinese mainland, see [Device Connection Regions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1105/42712) to select a suitable site for connection.

We have built a smart home demo to demonstrate the features of IoT Hub. Scenarios include:

- Scenario 1: the door is connected with the air conditioner, and actions of entering/leaving the house are monitored through the door to instruct the air conditioner to turn on/off.
- Scenario 2: It describes how the user can set the air conditioner temperature and check the energy consumption of the air conditioner using an app.

The demo involves the following features of IoT Hub:

- Message publishing and subscribing
- Device shadow-based status reporting and configuration distribution
- Rule engine-based device message communication

You can refer to the demo and customize based on your own needs:
