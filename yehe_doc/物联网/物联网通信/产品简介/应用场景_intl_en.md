## Internet of Vehicles
**Human-Vehicle interaction:** IoT Hub can collect and analyze data about the driving habits of the driver, monitor the real-time conditions of vehicle parts such as tires, brake pads, and air conditioners as well as traffic conditions, and thereby provide traffic advice in a timely manner. Further, such data can be combined with the data in insurance company databases to select the most appropriate insurance policy.
