## Overview
After a product is created, you can configure topics that devices can publish or subscribe to on the permission list page. A device inherits permissions from the product to which it belongs, and permissions can be added, deleted, or modified only at the product level.


## Directions
### Adding topic permission
1. Log in to the [IoT Hub console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iotcloud) and click **Products** on the left sidebar.
2. On the product list page, click the product name and select **Permissions**.
3. On the permission list page, click **Add Topic Permission**, enter the topic name, and assign an operation permission to the device.
 - Operation Name: the name can contain 1â€“64 letters, digits, and underscores, where different levels are separated by `/`, and `+` indicates a level. The name should be in the format of `/+/name` rather than `/+aaa/`.
 - Permission: you can select **Subscribe**, **Publish**, or **Subscribe and Publish**, and the selected permission can be changed subsequently.
