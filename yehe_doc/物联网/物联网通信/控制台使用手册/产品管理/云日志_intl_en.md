The cloud log module of IoT Hub provides a comprehensive, stable, and reliable log service that logs information in multiple dimensions such as device behavior, message content, and device exception. You can search for key device logs by time, log type, result, device name, `RequestID`, and keyword to identify and troubleshoot business issues easily.

## Running Log
