## Overview
IoT Hub provides the multi-level device grouping feature to meet your needs for managing devices under different products by group in different business scenarios. You can:
- Add, delete, modify, and query groups.
- Add devices under different products or the same product to a group.
- Add subgroups under a group or subgroup.
- Query the list of devices in a group.

This document describes how to group devices in the console.

## Directions
### Creating group
1. Log in to the [IoT Hub console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iotcloud) and click **[Groups](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iothub/groups)** on the left sidebar.
2. On the group management page, click **Create Group**.
3. In the group adding pop-up window, enter relevant information. When creating a group, you need to select the group to which it belongs. A level-1 group always belongs to the default project, a level-2 group can belong to a level-1 group, a level-3 group can belong to a level-2 group, and so on. You can customize the group name and description.
 - Parent Group: there is no limit on the number of group levels. One group can have up to 100 subgroups. 
 - Group Name: it can contain 4â€“30 letters, digits, and underscores. 
 - Group Description: it can contain up to 255 characters.

 - Group Description: it is customizable and describes the group.
 - Devices: it indicates the total number of devices in the group.
 - Included Subgroups: it indicates the total number of subgroups in the group.
 - Creation Time: it indicates the time the group was created in the console or through APIs, accurate to the second.



### Managing group
1. Log in to the [IoT Hub console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/iotcloud).
2. Click the group name to enter the group management page, where you can manage the device list.

4. The device list displays the information of the devices in the group (e.g., floor1), including device name, status, product, and last connection time and operation.
 - Device Name: `devicename`.
 - Status: online/offline status of the device.
 - Product: name of the product to which the device belongs.
 - Login Time: last connection time of the device, accurate to the second. "-" will be displayed if the device has never been connected.
 - Click **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the device details page of the corresponding device.
 - Click **Remove** in the **Operation** column to remove the device from the group. **This operation will not delete the device**.
5. You can add subgroups to or remove subgroups from any group. Click the group name to enter the group management page, where you can manage the subgroup list.
 - Just like under parent groups, you can create subgroups under subgroups and add devices to them.
 - As regards the group level, if the group is a level-1 group, only the name of the level-1 group is displayed; if it is a level-n group, the names of the n levels of groups are displayed, such as `group1` and `group1/group2.../groupn`.
