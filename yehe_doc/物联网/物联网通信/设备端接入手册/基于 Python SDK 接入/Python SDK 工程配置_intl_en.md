IoT Hub device SDK for Python relies on a secure and powerful data channel to enable IoT developers to quickly connect devices to the cloud for two-way communication. You only need to complete the corresponding project configuration to connect devices.

## Prerequisites
Products and devices have been created as instructed in [Device Connection Preparations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1105/41476).
## How to Import
- If you want to develop a project through import, you can install the SDK as follows:
```
pip3 install tencent-iot-device
```
If you need to view the used SDK version, run the following command:
```
pip3 show --files tencent-iot-device
```
If you need to update the SDK version, run the following command:
```
pip3 install --upgrade tencent-iot-device
```
- If you want to develop a project through code integration, you can download the SDK for Python source code from [Github](https://github.com/tencentyun/iot-device-python).
