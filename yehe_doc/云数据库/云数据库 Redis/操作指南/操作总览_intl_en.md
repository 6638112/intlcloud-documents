During the use of TencentDB for Redis, you may encounter problems related to accessing, maintaining, backing up, and restoring instances. This document describes common operations on TencentDB for Redis instances.

## Instance
A database instance can contain multiple user-created databases and can be accessed using the same client tools and applications as those for a standalone database instance.
Common operations in a TencentDB for Redis instance are as follows:

- [Connecting to instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/7042)
- [Specifying project for instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31933)
- [Changing instance specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31934)
- [Enabling/Disabling read/write separation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31935)
- [Terminating instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31937)


## Data
Common data operations in a TencentDB for Redis are as follows:

### Backup and restoration

- [Backing up data](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/7071)
- [Restoring data](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/7072)
- [Cloning data](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31897)

### Data migration

- [Migrating with redis-port](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31940)
- [Migrating with DTS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31941)

## Security Group
A [security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31945) is a stateful virtual firewall capable of filtering. As an important means for network security isolation provided by Tencent Cloud, it can be used to set network access controls for one or more TencentDB instances.
