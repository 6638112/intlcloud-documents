CTSDB currently supports only one network mode for instance access: [VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535). It ensures data security by providing VPC-based network isolation and access authentication with username and password.

After creation, each CTSDB instance has a private network address and port. When you initialize an instance, you can access the instance through the RESTful API after setting the password of the root account.
