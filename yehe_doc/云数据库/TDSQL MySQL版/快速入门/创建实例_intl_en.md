## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL Purchase Page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb/buy), select a region, specify the AZs, network type, shard specifications, etc., and click **Buy Now**.
 - For more information, please see [Instance Architecture](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33319), [Shard Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33354), and [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/35777).
 - The networks of Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate with one another.
