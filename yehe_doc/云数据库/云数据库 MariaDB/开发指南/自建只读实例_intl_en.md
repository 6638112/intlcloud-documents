## 1. Overview
### 1.1 Overview
If you only need to implement [read/write separation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/35409), currently, all TencentDB for MariaDB replicas support read-only access. For more information, please see [Read/Write Separation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/35409).

However, you may still need extra read-only instances to implement more flexible control and construct more complex business systems. Therefore, TencentDB for MariaDB supports the scheme of self-created read-only instances based on CVM.

### 1.2 Architecture of a self-created read-only instance
As shown below, the self-created instance features "syncing" data to one or more self-created instances by using primary/replica sync or binlog sync of TProxy outside a TencentDB for MariaDB cluster. With this feature, you can install any software or perform any data operations on the CVM instances you have control over.

To ensure the performance and stability of the TencentDB for MariaDB cluster, only the async scheme is provided for self-created read-only instances, and the data sync delay will be increased when the cluster pressure is high so as to reduce performance loss of the primary cluster. This means the data delay of your self-created read-only instances may vary from several seconds to several minutes. If you require low delay, we recommend that you use [read/write separation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/35409) of TencentDB for MariaDB.

## 2. Creation Scheme
### 2.1 Determine the MariaDB kernel version
Generally, you can view the MariaDB kernel version in the instance list or instance details. Currently, MariaDB 10.0.10 and 10.1.9 are supported (more versions will be supported in the future, but the basic scheme will stay unchanged).

### 2.2 Create a CVM with supported specifications
Create a CVM instance based on your existing instance memory and disk capacity.
	
- **CVM specification**: we recommend that you create a CVM instance whose specification is around 20% higher than that of your TencentDB for MariaDB instance, with at least 50 GB more data disk capacity and 2 GiB more memory. If you need to install other software on the CVM instance, please increase the CVM specification as appropriate.
- **Operating system**: CentOS 6 or 7 is recommended.
- **Data disk formatting**: the ext3 file system is required, and the disk needs to be mounted to the `/data` directory.
- **Installed MariaDB**: the same version as the TencentDB for MariaDB instance must be installed.

### 2.3 Example of MariaDB installation
On CentOS, for example, install `MariaDB 10.0.10` and `MariaDB 10.1.9` by following the steps below:
1. Configure and add the yum source file (`vi /etc/yum.repos.d/mariadb.repo`).
 The official yum source for v10.0.10 is as shown below:
```
# MariaDB 10.0 CentOS repository list - created 2016-05-30 02:16 UTC
# http://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
#baseurl = http://yum.mariadb.org/10.0/centos7-amd64
baseurl = http://archive.mariadb.org/mariadb-10.0.10/yum/centos6-amd64/
gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck=0
```
The official yum source for v10.1.9 is as shown below:
```
# MariaDB 10.1 CentOS repository list - created 2016-05-30 02:16 UTC
# http://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/
[mariadb]
name = MariaDB
#baseurl = http://yum.mariadb.org/10.1/centos7-amd64
baseurl = http://archive.mariadb.org/mariadb-10.1.9/yum/centos6-amd64/
gpgkey=https://yum.mariadb.org/RPM-GPG-KEY-MariaDB
gpgcheck=0
```
2. Check whether the MariaDB version corresponding to the yum source is correct.
```
yum makecache
yum info MariaDB-server
```
3. Install "MariaDB-server" and "MariaDB-client".
```
yum install MariaDB-server MariaDB-client MariaDB-devel -y
Note: if the system prompts a conflict with a legacy version, you need to remove the previously installed package by running `yum remove mariadb-libs` for example.
```

### 2.4 Install Mydumper
Download address: https://launchpad.net/mydumper
Compile and install: `yum install make cmake pcre-devel glib2-devel zlib-devel gcc-c++`
Decompress `mydumper-0.9.1.tar.gz` and enter the directory for installation:
```
cmake . 
make && make install
```
Run `mydumper â€“V` after the installation to view the version information.

### 2.5 Configure and launch MariaDB on CVM
Delete the file `/etc/my.cnf.d/enable_encryption.preset`:
```
rm -f /etc/my.cnf.d/enable_encryption.preset
```
Create a directory:
```
mkdir -p /data/dbdata/{data,tmpdir}
mkdir -p /data/dblogs/relay
```
Modify the configuration file `/etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf:`:
```
[mysqld]
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci
innodb_page_size=16384
lower_case_table_names=1
server-id=10
innodb_buffer_pool_size=2097152000
skip-name-resolve
datadir = /data/dbdata/data/
relay-log = /data/dblogs/relay/relay.log
log-error = /data/dblogs/mysqld.err
tmpdir = /data/dbdata/tmpdir
```

Note: 
When configuring these parameters, you can run `show global variables like xxx` on the original instance to view its parameters for reference.
- Parameters such as `character-set-server`, `lower_case_table_names`, and `innodb_page_size` must be the same as those in the original TDSQL instance.
- The value of `innodb_buffer_pool_size` can be set based on the same parameter in TDSQL.
- The value of `server-id` must be different from that in the original TDSQL instance.
- Run `mysql_install_db` to install the database.
- Run `chown -R mysql:mysql /data/dbdata/  /data/dblogs/` to modify the file owner.
- Run `service mysql start` to start MariaDB.
- Change the root password and test login:
mysqladmin -u root password 'root';
mysql -uroot -proot -hlocalhost -P3306


### 2.6 Create a database account for synchronization
If you want to sync data from the primary, create a regular account; if from a replica, create a read-only account (we recommend that you sync from the replica to avoid affecting the primary).
A database account should have at least the global permissions `SELECT, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT, RELOAD`. If the configuration of permissions in the console fails, or there is no desired permission, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact the customer service to add required permissions for your synchronization account.

### 2.7 Export TDSQL data using Mydumper
Note: there will be a table lock in the first export. Please evaluate whether this is acceptable to your business. We recommend performing this operation during off-peak hours.
Use Mydumper to export TDSQL data (add the database to be synced after `-B`):
`mydumper -t 4 --host 10.xx.183.239 --port 3306 --user=user --password=password001 --outputdir=./export_tdsql -B syncdb`
Use Myloader to import data (add the database to be synced after `-B`):
`myloader --host localhost --port 3306 --user=root --password=root -d ./export_tdsql -o -B syncdb`


### 2.8 Build primary-replica sync relationship
View the metadata file information exported in step 2.7.
`cat export_tdsql/metadata`
It should contain the binlog location and GTID information; otherwise, the primary/replica sync relationship cannot be established.
```
SHOW MASTER STATUS:
Log: binlog.000003
Pos: 64233211
GTID:0-2694363359-883267
Log in to the database of the CVM instance to configure the primary and replica:
Configure the database to be synced:
set global replicate_do_db='syncdb';
Set `gtid_slave_pos`:
SET GLOBAL gtid_slave_pos = "0-2694363359-883267";
Configure the primary/replica relationship:
CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST='10.xx.183.239',MASTER_PORT=3306,MASTER_USER='user',MASTER_PASSWORD='password',master_use_gtid=slave_pos;
Start the replica:
START SLAVE;
View the replica status:
show slave status\G
```
If `Slave_IO_Running` and `Slave_SQL_Running` are in running status, the configuration is successful.

## 3. Considerations and Service Limits
- Read-only instances deployed based on CVM here will not be included in a TencentDB for MariaDB cluster for management, which means that if a node in the cluster fails, the read-only instances deployed in this scheme will never be promoted to primary instance. Therefore, this feature will not improve the system availability.
- You can mount multiple self-created read-only instances; however, we recommend that you keep the quantity no more than 4 for the sake of business performance.
- The self-created read-only instance feature is currently free of charge.
