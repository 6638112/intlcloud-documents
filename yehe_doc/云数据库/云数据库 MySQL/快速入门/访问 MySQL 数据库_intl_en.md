TencentDB for MySQL can be accessed in the following methods:

| Method | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Private network access | A CVM instance can be used to access the private network address of a TencentDB instance. This access method relies on the high-speed private network of Tencent Cloud and features low delay. <li>The two instances must be under the same account and in the same [VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535) in the same region or both in the classic network. <li>The private network address is provided by the system by default and can be viewed in the instance list or on the instance details page in the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). | 
| Public network access | If you cannot connect to the private network, you can access your TencentDB for MySQL instance at its public network address. <li>The public network address needs to be [manually enabled](#waiwang). It can be viewed on the instance details page in the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and can be disabled if no longer needed . <li>Enabling the public network address will expose your database service to the public network, which may lead to database intrusions or attacks; therefore, you are recommended to use the private network to access the database. <li>Public network access to TencentDB is suitable for development or auxiliary management of databases but not for formal business access, as potentially uncontrollable factors may lead to unavailability of the public network access, such as DDoS attacks and surges in access traffic. <li>The public network address can be enabled only for instances in the Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo, and Silicon Valley regions. |



The following describes how to log in to a TencentDB for MySQL instance from Windows and Linux CVM instance over the private and public networks.

5. Open MySQL Workbench, select **Database** > **Connect to Database**, enter your TencentDB for MySQL instance's private (or public) network address, username, and password and click **OK** to log in.
 - Hostname: enter the private (or public) network address which can be viewed together with the ports on the instance details page in the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). For the public network address, please check whether it has been enabled as instructed in [Enabling Public Network Address](#waiwang).
 - Port: private (or public) network port.
 - Username: the username is "root" by default. For public network access, you are recommended to [create a separate account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31900) for easier access control.
 - Password: the password corresponding to `Username`. If you forgot the password, please reset it as instructed in [Resetting Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31901).

## Accessing from Linux CVM
1. Log in to a Linux CVM instance. For more information, please see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10517" target="_blank">Configuring Linux CVM</a>.
2. Taking a CVM instance on CentOS 7.2 64-bit as an example, install the MySQL client by running the following command:
```
yum install mysql
```
If `Complete!` is displayed, it means the MySQL client is installed successfully.

3. Perform the corresponding operation based on the access method:
 - **Private network access:**
    1. Run the following command to log in to the TencentDB for MySQL instance.
```
mysql -h hostname -u username -p
```
      - hostname: replace it with the private network address of the target TencentDB for MySQL instance, which can be viewed on the instance details page in the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb).
		- username: replace it with the default username `root`.
    2. Enter the password corresponding to the `root` account of the TencentDB for MySQL instance after the prompt `Enter password:` is displayed. If you forgot the password, please reset it as instructed in [Resetting Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31901).
    If `MySQL [(none)]>` is displayed, it means that you have logged in to MySQL successfully.

   - **Public network access:**
    1. Run the following command to log in to the TencentDB for MySQL instance.
```
mysql -h hostname -P port -u username -p
```
      - hostname: replace it with the public network address of the target TencentDB for MySQL instance, which can be viewed together with the port on the instance details page in the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). If the public network address has not been enabled, please enable it as instructed in [Enabling Public Network Address](#waiwang).
      - port: replace it with the public port number.
      - username: replace it with the public network access username for public network access. You are recommended to [create a separate account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31900) for easier access control.
    2. Enter the password corresponding to the public network access username after the prompt `Enter password:` is displayed. If you forgot the password, please reset it as instructed in [Resetting Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31901).
    In this example, `hostname` is 59281c4exxx.myqcloud.com and public network port is 15311.
