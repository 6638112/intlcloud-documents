<td>QuickChange is supported</td>
<td>TencentDB for MySQL now supports QuickChange. If the physical machine where the instance is deployed has sufficient resources (aka local resources), you can adjust instance configuration in the QuickChange mode without migrating data. As less time is spent in the preparation stage, the overall adjustment process is faster.</td>
