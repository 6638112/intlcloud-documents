### How do I request a refund for a purchased instance if I donâ€™t need it anymore?
You can request a refund based on your instance type:
- Pay-as-you-go instance: TencentDB for MySQL will return resources directly. Refunds cannot be requested.

For more information, please see [Refunds](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/14618). 

### Will Tencent Cloud charge for pay-as-you-go instances if they are idle?
Yes. If you stop using pay-as-you-go resources, please terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fees.


### How is the backup capacity billed?
TencentDB for MySQL offers a certain amount of backup capacity for free based on the region. The capacity is equivalent to the sum of the storage capacity of all two-node and three-node instances (including source instances) in the region. 

Usage of backup capacity that exceeds the free tier will be charged at 0.000127 USD/GB/hour in the Chinese mainland. For prices for regions outside of the Chinese mainland, please see the [TencentDB for MySQL Price Calculator](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cdb/calculator).
