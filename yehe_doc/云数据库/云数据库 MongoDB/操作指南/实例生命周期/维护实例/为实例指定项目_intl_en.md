TencentDB for MongoDB supports assigning instances to different projects for management.

Notes:
- Assigning and reassigning TencentDB instances will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The default project is **Default Project**.
- You can reassign an assigned instance to another project by selecting **More** > **Assign to Project** in the instance list in the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb/sharding).
