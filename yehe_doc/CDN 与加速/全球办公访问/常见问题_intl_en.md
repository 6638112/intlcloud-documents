### How can I activate GOA?
Go to the [beta application page](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/p47nl94ubq), enter your basic information, and submit an application. The product team will contact you within three to five business days.
### How does GOA accelerate office data transmission?
Tencent Cloud has over 1,100 acceleration nodes deployed around the world. GOA utilizes inter-node dynamic route detection to schedule optimal routes for OA office data transmission and uses global load balancing technology to direct terminals to their nearest access acceleration nodes. This dramatically reduces data access latency.
### How does GOA quickly test control policies, and are policies preset at the backend?
Policies are preset at the backend for different security scenarios. You can start policy testing after modifying the target object.
### How can I view the users who access boundless office in GOA?
The user access management page displays the data of logged-in devices. A logged-in device supports boundless office if it has been configured with a Next Generation Network (NGN) policy. After a user closes the management page, no operation or update will be performed.
