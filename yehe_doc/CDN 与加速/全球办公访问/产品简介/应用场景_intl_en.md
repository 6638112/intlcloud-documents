Organization employees often encounter slow access, security threats, and other issues when working remotely. The following capabilities are therefore usually high on the list for enterprises: efficient and secure remote access, terminal assets inventory, access control and monitoring for malicious software or security risks.

Global Office Access (GOA) supports the following remote OA use cases:
### VPN-free Access
GOA does not require a VPN. Employees can securely access organization resources anytime and anywhere. This dramatically improves the remote working experience.
### Enterprise Resource Access
GOA utilizes a global acceleration network to dramatically improves remote working and resource access experience. It effectively prevents data access interruption, online conferences lagging, and other issues that compromise operational efficiency.
### Terminal Security Management
GOA implements security control, regulation-based admission, threat perception, data disclosure prevention, and other security capabilities to protect organization terminals and enterprise data.
### Access Permission Control
GOA performs role-based automatic, granular, and dynamic authorization according to your business requirements to ensure secure access to applications on both public or private clouds.
