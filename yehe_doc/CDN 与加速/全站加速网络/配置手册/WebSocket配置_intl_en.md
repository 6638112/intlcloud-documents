## Features
WebSocket is a protocol providing full-duplex communications over a single TCP connection, streamlining client-server data transfers and allowing the server to transfer data to the user. WebSocket is now available for ECDN.

## Configuration Method
Log in to the [ECDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dsa) and click **Manage** on the right of a domain name to enter its configuration page. Under the **Advanced Configuration** tab, click the button to enable **WebSocket Configuration**. You can click **Edit** as needed to modify the WebSocket timeout, which can be up to 65 seconds.

 
## Billing
WebSocket is a value-added service in the ECDN console, which is in beta and free of charge currently.
