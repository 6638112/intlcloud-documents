### How do I get the cache node IP accessed by the client?

The ECDN platform uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header field to deliver users' real IP address for origin-pull by default.

### Why is the obtained client IP address different from the user's real IP address?

When the client IP address obtained by the origin server from the `X-Forwarded-For` field is different from the user's real IP address, it may be caused by the following factors and can be solved in the following ways:

### How do I quickly locate a domain name access exception?

1. Check for the domain name resolution problem
   - Check whether the domain name resolution takes effect. You can check whether the CNAME configuration takes effect through DNS resolution and check whether the problem is caused by incorrect authoritative DNS resolution.
   - Check whether the client can get the node IP normally to confirm whether the user's local DNS resolution is exceptional.
2. Compare the response content before and after the acceleration
   - If the response of direct access to the origin server is exceptional, the access failure may be caused by exceptional origin server service.
   - If the response of direct access to the origin server is normal, the problem may be related to the ECDN acceleration platform and needs further troubleshooting. 
3. Confirm the affection scope.
   - If access requests of only a small number of users are exceptional, it is generally caused by the client network. In this case, you can change the access network or access node and try again.
   - If affected users are from a certain region or ISP, it may be caused by service exceptions on some nodes, and you should immediately [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for troubleshooting.
   - If access requests of all users are affected, it may be related with the origin server or acceleration platform, and you should immediately [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for troubleshooting.
4. Check whether the problem can be reproduced.
   - The problem is occasional and cannot be reproduced. It is generally caused by ISP network jitter and can be recovered automatically.
   - The problem can be reproduced if the access request is sent again. You can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) describing the access environment and error symptoms for assistance.
