## ECDN
- **Global acceleration**
With cache nodes deployed across the world, ECDN effectively reduces cross-border access delays and ensures smooth global acceleration.
- **Optimal linkage**
Cache nodes are interconnected in pairs with real-time detection enabled to locate the optimal transfer route with the aid of Tencent Cloud's proprietary optimal linkage algorithm.
- **Intelligent cache**
You can customize the rules for caching static resources on edge servers to get nearby static resources and speed up response.

## Access Security
- **Intelligent multi-origin switch**
Cache nodes actively monitor origin servers and automatically select the best-performing servers for access. In addition, cache nodes can actively eliminate faulty origin servers to ensure business stability and continuity.
- **Access control**
Access control features such as IP access limit, blacklist, and whitelist are supported.
- **HTTPS support**
Full-linkage transfer over HTTPS is supported to quickly transfer encrypted data, ensuring data security.
