### Dynamic Content Acceleration
 For the dynamic data in scenarios such as game battles, e-commerce transactions, financial payment, online education concerning teacher-student interactions, ECDN can select the optimal origin-pull linkage through technologies such as dynamic path detection and intelligent routing to greatly reduce access latency for users and solve problems such as slow loading of dynamic content, operation lags, etc., significantly improving user experience.

### Dynamic and Static Hybrid Acceleration
ECDN can automatically identify dynamic and static contents. Static contents are cached on edge servers and the requests to them are processed with the global load balancing technology, enabling nearby access for users to get resources. For dynamic contents, ECDN can determine the optimal linkage through dynamic path detection to pull origin servers for resources. With ECDN, you can have the one-stop acceleration service for dynamic and static content without using different platforms.

### Upload Acceleration
ECDN is ideal for uploading acceleration in information collection and content releasing scenarios such as audio/video uploading, file uploading, financial POST requests, and online course releasing. Through content delivery and dynamic acceleration technologies, stable and fast data uploading can be achieved.

### Secure Acceleration
Combining ECDN with [SCDN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/product/ecdn) allows you to quickly apply WAF protection, DDoS cleansing, precise access control, and more security protection features for your domain name, safeguarding your business without compromising the acceleration effect.

### Cross-border Acceleration

ECDN has deployed thousands of service nodes across the globe with network nodes covering more than 50 countries and regions, fully meeting your needs in business globalization.

### Office Collaboration Acceleration
Office collaboration not only involves sharing of static content such as files and documentation, but requires dynamic data transmission in multi-person collaboration and real-time communication, in which, however, work efficiency can be greatly reduced by slow downloading and information latency. With ECDN, the one-stop acceleration service for dynamic and static content can be delivered for your stable, reliable, and easy office collaboration.
