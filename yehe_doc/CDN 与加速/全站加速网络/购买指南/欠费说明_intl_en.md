## Overdue Status
ECDN is billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. The system will generate a bill and deduct the fees based on your actual usage in the last billing cycle. If your account balance is insufficient, your account will become overdue.
**Note:**
If your account becomes overdue when you purchase or use another Tencent Cloud service, your use of ECDN will be affected.

## Overdue Payment Alerts
If your account balance becomes negative, the system will send you an **overdue payment alert**, which will be triggered only once when your account balance turns negative.

## Grace Period
To avoid affecting your business, the system grants you a grace period to handle the overdue payment, during which it will send you renewal reminder.

- During the grace period, the current ECDN service of your account will **not be affected** and can still be used.
- During the grace period, you can change the current ECDN acceleration service configuration of your account.
- If you are billed daily, the grace period will be 24 hours by default.
- If you are billed monthly, the grace period will be 7 days by default.

## Service Suspension Period
- If your fail to top up your account within the grace period, it will enter the service suspension period, and the system will push a **service suspension notification**. At this point, be sure to top up as soon as possible.
- During the service suspension period, restrictions will be put on your use of service, including but not limited to:
 - Your account will be locked, and you cannot add or change the ECDN acceleration service.
 - All your ECDN services will be automatically disabled. After that, acceleration domain names will be directly resolved to the origin server and no longer enjoy acceleration services.

## Account Top-up
- When your account is overdue, you can enable ECDN again in the console after topping up. Â  
- For acceleration domain names that are forcibly deactivated due to overdue payment, you need to activate them again in the console before you can use ECDN again.
