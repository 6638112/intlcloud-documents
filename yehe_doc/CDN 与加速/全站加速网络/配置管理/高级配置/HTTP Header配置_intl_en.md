An HTTP message generally contains:
+ Request message sent from client to server.
+ Response message sent from server to client.

These messages all consist of a beginning line, one or multiple headers, a blank line indicating the end of headers, and an optional message body.

HTTP headers divide into common header, request header, response header, and entity header. Each header consists of a domain name, colon (":"), and domain value, such as `Connection:keep-alive`.
If you use the HTTP header configuration feature provided by ECDN, when an end user requests a business resource, you can add a custom header in the returned **response message** to implement cross-origin access.

>
> + As the HTTP header configuration is for a specified domain name, once the configuration takes effect, the configured header will be added to the response messages of user requests for any resource under this domain name.
> + HTTP header configuration affects only response of the client (such as browser) rather than ECDN node's caching behaviors.

## Configuration Description
ECDN allows you to configure the following headers:
+ Content-Disposition: it activates download in the browser and sets the default filename of the downloaded file.
+ Content-Language: it specifies the language used in the client (such as browser) response for the resource.
+ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: it specifies the sources of cross-origin requests allowed to access the resource.
+ Access-Control-Allow-Methods: it specifies the allowed methods of cross-origin requests.
+ Access-Control-Max-Age: it specifies the validity period for caching the returned result of preflight request for a particular resource when a cross-origin request is initiated.
+ Access-Control-Expose-Headers: it specifies the headers visible to the client when a cross-origin request is initiated.

### General configuration
#### Content-Disposition
`Content-Disposition` is used to activate download in the browser and set the default filename of the downloaded resource. When the server sends a file to the client browser, if it is in a type supported by the browser, such as .txt or .jpg, it will be directly opened in the browser by default. If you want to ask the user to save the file, you can configure the `Content-Disposition` field to override the browser's default behavior. The common configuration is `Content-Disposition:attachment;filename=FileName.txt`

#### Content-Language
`Content-Language` specifies the code of the language used by the webpage. Common configurations are as follows:
- `Content-Language: zh-CN`
- `Content-Language: en-US`

### Cross-Origin access configuration
Cross-origin access refers to a scenario where a resource under a domain name, such as `www.abc.com`, initiates a request to another resource under another domain name, such as `www.def.com`. As the resource domain names are different, **cross-origin access** will occur. Using different protocols or ports can cause cross-origin access. You need to add configuration related to cross-origin access in the response header to make the first resource get the desired data.

#### Access-Control-Allow-Origin
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is used to solve the problem of cross-origin permissions of resources. Its value specifies the origins that can access the resource. You can also set the wildcard `\*` to allow all origins to access the resource. Common configurations are as follows:
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.test.com`

Pay attention to the following limits when configuring `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`:
+ Do not use wildcard domain names, e.g., `*.qq.com`.
+ Only configure it as `\*` or specify a URI.
+ When configuring a specified domain name, add the "http://" or "https://" prefix.

#### Access-Control-Allow-Methods 
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods` is used to specify the HTTP request methods allowed for cross-origin access. Multiple methods can be set as follows:
`Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS`

#### Access-Control-Max-Age
`Access-Control-Max-Age` specifies the validity period of a preflight request.
For a non-simple cross-origin request, before the formal communication, an HTTP query request called "preflight request" needs to be made to check whether the cross-origin request is secure and acceptable. The following requests are considered as non-simple cross-origin requests:
+ The request is initiated in a method other than `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST` or is initiated by using `POST` with a data type other than `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, and `text/plain`, such as `application/xml` or `text/xml`.
+ A custom request header is used.

`Access-Control-Max-Age` is measured in seconds. Here, the configuration sample `Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000` indicates that no more preflight requests will be sent for the cross-domain access to this resource within 1,728,000 seconds (20 days).

#### Access-Control-Expose-Headers
`Access-Control-Expose-Headers` specifies which headers can be accessed when a cross-region request is initiated. By default, the following six types of headers can be exposed to the client:
- Cache-Control
- Content-Language
- Content-Type
- Expires
- Last-Modified
- Pragma

If you want the client to access other header information, you can set as follows (separate multiple headers with `;`):
`Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Content-Length, QCloud-DSA-MyCustom-HeaderY`

Then, the server will allow requests to contain the `Content-Length` and `QCloud-DSA-MyCustom-HeaderY` fields.

### Custom header
ECDN allows you to add custom headers as needed.
The following fields cannot be added currently:
```
	Date  
	Expires 
	Content-Type
	Content-Encoding
	Content-Length
	Transfer-Encoding
	Cache-Control
	If-Modified-Since
	Last-Modified
	Connection
	Content-Range
	ETag
	Accept-Ranges
	Age
	Authentication-Info
	Proxy-Authenticate
	Retry-After
	Set-Cookie
	Vary
	WWW-Authenticate
	Content-Location
	Content-MD5
	Content-Range
	Meter
	Allow
	Error
```

### Configuration process
1. Log in to the [ECDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dsa) and click **Domain Management** on the left sidebar. On the management page, click **Manage** on the right of the target domain name to enter the domain management page.
2. Click **Advanced Configuration** and click **Add HTTP Header** in the **HTTP Header Configuration** module.

3. In the pop-up window, select the HTTP header to be added and enter the corresponding value. You can click **Add Parameter** to add more header fields. Click **OK** to submit the settings.

4. The configuration will take effect in about 5 minutes. In the table at the bottom, you can view the added HTTP headers. You can click **Modify** or **Delete** on the right of a header to perform the corresponding operation as needed.

5. You can click **Add HTTP Header** to add more HTTP headers, each of which can be added only once.
