## Basic Configuration Project
### Modifying project of domain name

3. To avoid faulty operations, when you need to delete configuration of an acceleration region, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=83&level2_id=532&source=0&data_title=%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%81%E5%8A%A0%E9%80%9F%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%20DSA&step=1) to apply for modification.

> The acceleration service outside Mainland China is currently in beta. If your account cannot modify the acceleration region, it indicates that you have not been granted the acceleration permission outside China. You can submit an application on the [ECDN global acceleration eligibility application page](https://cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/4q956obis68), and the system will review it in 5 business days and inform you of the result through SMS or internal message.

3. After the modification is completed, click **OK** to submit the configuration. The system backend will deliver the new origin server modification to the domain name, which will take effect in 3â€“5 minutes.
