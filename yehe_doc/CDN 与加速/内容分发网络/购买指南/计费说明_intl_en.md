# Billing Overview

## Billing overview

### Billing regions

Tencent Cloud CDN has two service regions, namely, **Mainland China** and **outside Mainland China**.

In Mainland China, fees are charged uniformly and there are no pricing differences between different regions.

Outside Mainland China, there are eight billing regions determined according to the location of Tencent Cloud CDN node servers, namely, Asia Pacific Region 1, Asia Pacific Region 2, Asia Pacific Region 3, Middle East, Europe, North America, South America, and Africa, as shown below:

- Asia Pacific Region 1: Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Singapore, Vietnam, and Thailand
- Asia Pacific Region 2: Taiwan (China), Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea
- Asia Pacific Region 3: the Philippines, India, Australia, and other Asia Pacific countries and regions

Note:

- CDN fees for Mainland China and the regions outside Mainland China are calculated separately according to the applicable unit price and usage.

### Billing mode

CDN offers two billing modes, **bill-by-bandwidth** and **bill-by-traffic**.

| Monthly average of daily peak bandwidth values | There are 288 CDN bandwidth statistical points per day, the highest of which is the daily peak bandwidth. The billable bandwidth is the average daily peak bandwidth of all valid days, and fees will be calculated based on the contracted price. | If your monthly CDN service fees exceed or are estimated to exceed 20,000 USD, please submit a ticket to contact us for a more flexible billing plan. | Please see [Billing Details](#billed-by-monthly-average-of-daily-bandwidth-values). |
|    Monthly 95th percentile bandwidth    | There are 288 CDN bandwidth sample points per day. Starting from the 1st day of the current month, all sample points of valid days (when bandwidth is actually consumed) are sorted in order. The first 5% points are removed, and the remaining highest value is the billable bandwidth. The fees are then calculated based on the contracted price. |                                                              | Please see [Billing Details](#billed-by-monthly-95th-percentile-bandwidth). |
|     Monthly traffic     |       The total traffic used in a month will be charged at the contracted price.       |                                                              |                              /                               |

> Note:
>
> - Each CDN node collects traffic data in real time and reports it to the billing center which aggregates the data entries into total traffic data. For bill-by-bandwidth, bandwidth value = 5-minute total traffic / 300s. For example, if the total traffic generated in 5 minutes is 30 MB, the corresponding bandwidth will be (30 * 8) / 300 = 0.8 Mbps (1 MB = 8 Mbps).
> - Base conversion: 1 GB = 1,000 MB; 1 MB = 1,000 KB; 1 Gbps = 1,000 Mbps; 1 Mbps = 1,000 Kbps.

## Billing details

### Bill-by-bandwidth


CDN affers a region-specific tiered pricing model based on daily peak bandwidth. The pricing tiers are as shown below:

| Bandwidth Tier (USD/Mbps/Day) | Mainland China - CN | North America - NA | Europe - EU | Asia Pacific Region 1 - AP1 | Asia Pacific Region 2 - AP2 | Asia Pacific Region 3 - AP3 | Middle East - ME | Africa - AA | South America - SA |
| :----------------------- | ------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 0–500 Mbps          | 0.094         | 0.2941    | 0.2941    | 0.4412        | 0.5882        | 0.6471        | 0.8529    | 0.6471    | 0.6471    |
| 500 Mbps–5 Gbps          | 0.092         | 0.2471    | 0.2471    | 0.3882        | 0.5294        | 0.5941        | 0.7824    | 0.5941    | 0.5941    |
| 5–50 Gbps           | 0.086         | 0.1824    | 0.1824    | 0.3412        | 0.4706        | 0.5471        | 0.7059    | 0.5471    | 0.5471    |
| ≥ 50 Gbps                 | 0.084         | 0.1294    | 0.1294    | 0.2941        | 0.4118        | 0.5           | 0.6176    | 0.5       | 0.5       |

#### Calculation method

Assuming that the peak bandwidth of CDN in Mainland China is X and there is no consumption outside Mainland China, the calculation method for tiered pricing is as follows:

1. If X < 500 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.094.
2. If 500 Mbps ≤ X < 5,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.092.
3. If 5,000 Mbps ≤ X < 50,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.086.
4. If X ≥ 50,000 Mbps, the bill amount will be X * 0.084.

CDN service fees in other regions are charged based on their respective unit price and usage.

### Bill-by-traffic


CDN offers a region-specific bill-by-traffic with monthly cumulative tier. The pricing tiers are as shown below:

| Traffic Tier (USD/GB) | Mainland China - CN | North America - NA | Europe - EU | Asia Pacific Region 1 - AP1 | Asia Pacific Region 2 - AP2 | Asia Pacific Region 3 - AP3 | Middle East - ME | Africa - AA | South America - SA |
| :------------------ | ------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :------------ | :------------ | :------------ | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| 0–2 TB           | 0.037         | 0.0547    | 0.0547    | 0.0812        | 0.1094        | 0.12          | 0.1588    | 0.12      | 0.12      |
| 2–10 TB          | 0.035         | 0.0459    | 0.0459    | 0.0724        | 0.1024        | 0.1129        | 0.1465    | 0.1129    | 0.1129    |
| 10–50 TB         | 0.032         | 0.0388    | 0.0388    | 0.0653        | 0.0935        | 0.1059        | 0.1359    | 0.1059    | 0.1059    |
| 50–100 TB        | 0.026         | 0.0318    | 0.0318    | 0.0582        | 0.0847        | 0.0988        | 0.1253    | 0.0988    | 0.0988    |
| ≥ 100 TB             | 0.02          | 0.0247    | 0.0247    | 0.0547        | 0.0759        | 0.0918        | 0.1147    | 0.0918    | 0.0918    |

#### Calculation method

Unlike bill-by-bandwidth, bill-by-traffic is based on a monthly cumulative tier. Here is an example describing how to calculate the fees:

- Suppose the traffic generated in Mainland China on January 1 is 3 TB and there is no consumption outside Mainland China, as shown below. The gray zone represents the actual billing tier and the green zone shows the traffic generated on January 1. As 2 TB falls into the 0–2 TB billing tier and the remaining 1 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier, the actual fees for January 1 will be 2 * 1000 * 0.037 + 1 * 1000 * 0.035.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/bfdae242f6cca57421a65e46a96b0c67/image.png)
- Suppose the traffic generated in Mainland China on January 2 is also 3 TB and there is no consumption outside Mainland China, as shown below. As bill-by-traffic is based on monthly cumulative traffic, all the 3 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 2 will be 3 * 1000 * 0.035.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/f62d1056c1c2cab249cec62ad6e74ddc/image.png)
- Suppose the traffic generated in Mainland China on January 3 is 7 TB and there is no consumption outside Mainland China, as shown below. Of this 7 TB, 4 TB falls into the 2–10 TB tier and the remaining 3 TB into the 10–50 TB tier, so the actual fees for January 3 will be 4 * 1000 * 0.035 + 3 * 1000 * 0.032.
  ![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/954e2d483e31afd411f9a91ebd7f66c8/image.png)

The fees incurred each day in January can be calculated accordingly with the above described method. A new billing cycle will begin on February 1.

### Bill-by-monthly-average-bandwidth

1. Suppose a customer's billing officially started on February 1, 2017 and the contracted price for the specified zone is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 valid days in February , we take the maximum value of the 288 statistical points for each of those 14 valid days as Max_1, Max_2, Max_3..., and Max_14, respectively. The billable bandwidth will be Average(Max_1, Max_2, ..., Max_14), and so the February fee is: Average(Max_1, Max_2, ..., Max_14) * P * 14 / 28.



### Bill-by-monthly-95th-percentile-bandwidth

1. Suppose a customer's billing officially started on February 1 and the contracted price for the specified zone is P USD/Mbps/month.
2. A valid day refers to a day when more than 0 Kbps of bandwidth is consumed.
3. Assuming there are 14 valid days in February , 14 valid days has 14 * 288 statistical points, and the highest 5% points are removed. The highest remaining point is the Max95, which is the billable bandwidth. So the February fee is: Max95 * P * 14 / 28.

## Choosing a billing plan

> Note:
>
> If you discover that the selected billing mode is not suitable for your business needs during use, you can change it. For more information, please see [Changing Billing Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/32326).

**Options:**
CDN provides two billing modes: **bill-by-traffic** and **bill-by-bandwidth**. You can select an appropriate billing mode as needed.

**Calculation example:**

Assuming that the traffic consumed between 00:00 and 24:00 yesterday was 200 GB and was generated in Mainland China, and the peak bandwidth was 40 Mbps, the curve will be as follows:

![img](https://mc.qcloudimg.com/static/img/3ecfe86a031782ebeaf0b1f7595cc69f/image.png)

If you select bill-by-traffic mode, you will need to pay: 200 * 0.037 = 7.4 USD

If you select bill-by-bandwidth mode, you will need to pay: 40 * 0.094 = 3.76 USD 

We recommend bill-by-bandwidth as it is more cost-effective.

## Note on arrears

Tencent Cloud will notify you through multiple channels including email and SMS when your account falls into arrears. A **24-hour** grace period is provided. If you fail to top up your account within 24 hours, your CDN service will be suspended. You will need to manually activate the acceleration service in the CDN Console after topping up your account.

> Note:
>
> When your acceleration service is suspended due to arrears, all your domain names will be deactivated and all access requests will be forwarded to the origin server. You can query information but cannot modify configurations in the CDN Console. Your CDN-related domain names and configurations will be retained for 12 months.
