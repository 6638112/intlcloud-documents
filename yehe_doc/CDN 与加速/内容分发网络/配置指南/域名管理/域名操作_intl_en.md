### Editing tags

- Change the tag of one domain name: click the target domain name to enter its configuration page, open the **Basic Configuration** tab, click the pencil icon on the right of **Tag** in the **Basic Information** section.
- Batch change the tags of multiple domain names: tick target domain names and click **More Actions** -> **Edit Tag** on the top. You can change the tags of up to 50 domain names at a time. The changes do not take effect immediately, please refresh to view the new tags.	



### Disabling the acceleration service

You can disable the acceleration service for normally-running domain names. After the acceleration service is disabled for a domain name, its configurations will be deactivated on CDN cache nodes across the entire network. If access requests to the domain name are still redirected to CDN nodes, a 404 error will be returned. Therefore, before disabling a domain name, make sure that its CNAME record is resolved to a non-CDN CNAME address.

> !Consumption will no longer be generated after the acceleration service is completely disabled.

- Disable the acceleration service for one domain name: on the right of the target domain name, click **More** -> **Disable**.
- Batch disable the acceleration service for multiple domain names: tick enabled domain names and click **More Actions** -> **Disable Acceleration** on the top.



### Enabling the acceleration service

You can enable the acceleration service for disabled domain names to distribute their configurations to cache nodes across the entire network again.

- Enable the acceleration service for one domain name: on the right of a disabled domain name, click **More** -> **Enable**.
- Batch enable the acceleration service for multiple domain names: tick disabled domain names and click **More Actions** -> **Enable Acceleration** on the top.

> !If an enabled domain name has no operations or consumption for 3 months, it will be considered inactive and CDN will automatically disable its acceleration service.



### Deleting acceleration domain names

If the domain names are in **Disabled** status, you can delete them. Once they are deleted, their configurations will be cleared and cannot be restored, and their statistical data can no longer be viewed. Please operate with caution.

- Delete one domain name: on the right of the target domain name, click **More** -> **Delete**.
- Batch delete multiple domain names: tick disabled domain names and click **More Actions** -> **Delete** on the top.
