## Global Intelligent Scheduling

When accessing resources, a variety of factors including the ISP network, client region, and the network bandwidth of the IDC server might affect the response time and user experience. 

Through real-time monitoring of the linkages across the entire network and leveraging Tencent Cloud's self-designed GSLB scheduling system and intelligent routing technology, CDN schedules users' access requests to the optimal edge nodes for acceleration. This ensures quick and stable resource access for users. 

## Quick Configuration
You can use CDN to accelerate your services through a simple and quick configuration process, with no additional modification required on your end.

After registering a Tencent Cloud account and completing identity verification, you can activate CDN service. Prepayment is not required. Add your business domain name in the CDN Console and wait for about 5 minutes for the domain name configuration to be distributed to cache nodes across the entire network. During this process, as the acceleration service has not taken effect yet, your business will not be affected in the production environment.

When enabling the acceleration service, you need to modify the CNAME resolution configuration with your domain name service provider. Acceleration service will take effect when the DNS takes effect.

## Rich Features

CDN comes with an easy-to-use, full-featured console where you can change the configuration items and view monitoring data as needed:

**Domain name management**
+ You can add, delete, launch, and deactivate domain names.
+ You can switch acceleration regions and select "Mainland China", "Outside Mainland China", or "Global" for the acceleration scope.
+ You can customize the domain name list page to display, filter, and query configuration items.

**Domain name configuration**
+ You can configure an external origin server (IP list or domain names) or use COS as an origin server. Round robin and weighted origin-pull as well as hot backup of origin server are supported.
+ You can configure custom access control policies such as referer blacklist/whitelist, IP blacklist/whitelist, timestamp hotlink protection, and IP access frequency limit.
+ You can customize the expiration time of node cache, status code cache, and HTTP header cache.
+ CDN supports configuring optimizations for cross-border origin-pull linkage, range GETs, and 301/302 origin-pull follow-redirect.
+ CDN supports HTTPS acceleration, HTTP/2 acceleration, and forced request redirection.
+ You can configure the bandwidth cap and customize advanced configuration items such as HTTP response header, auto compression, and SEO.

**Cache purge**
+ Self-service purging of the entire network’s cache is supported, as well as directory purge and URL purge.

**Real-time monitoring**
+ CDN supports real-time monitoring of the bandwidth, traffic, traffic hit rate, number of requests, and all status codes generated by access requests at a granularity of 1 minute. The statistics can be filtered by project, domain name, province, ISP, and protocol to present a comprehensive view of service status.
+ CDN supports real-time monitoring of the origin-pull bandwidth, traffic, number of requests, failure rate, and all status codes generated by origin-pull requests at a granularity of 1 minute. The statistics can be filtered by project or domain name to help you conveniently view the origin server status.
+ You can view real-time reports of user distribution by region around the globe or by ISP in Mainland China.
+ CDN provides daily, weekly and monthly operational reports to keep you updated on business fluctuations.

**Log service**

+ All logs generated by access requests are grouped by hour and can be downloaded.

**CDN APIs**
CDN provides [APIs](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/30974) for all the supported features listed above to enable customized service usage. You and your team can conveniently manage, monitor, display and analyze your business via these APIs.
