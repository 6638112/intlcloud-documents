## Unique IP Access Requests
The number of unique IP access requests in the specified time period is calculated by deduplicating access client IPs in the log:
<li>If the time range is less than or equal to one day, a deduplicated IP curve with a 5-minute granularity will be provided.</li>
<li> Domain name statistics are counted by deduplicating the active quantity in a full day. If there are multiple domain names, projects or accounts, the statistics are counted by accumulating the daily active quantity of each one with a 5-minute granularity.</li>
