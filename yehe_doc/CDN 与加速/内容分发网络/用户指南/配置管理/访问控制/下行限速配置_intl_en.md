## Configuration Overview

Tencent Cloud CDN supports downstream speed limit configuration for setting the maximum downstream throughput speed over one single URL on the server.
The downstream speed limit configuration can control the peak bandwidth of CDN to a certain degree. It is frequently used in scenarios such as ecommerce promotion and new version releases and updates of games.

>! After the downstream speed limit is configured, user access experience and CDN acceleration effect will be affected. Therefore, please use it with caution.

## Configuration Guide

### Configuration limitations

- Maximum number of downstream speed limit rules: 10
- Unit: KB/s; value range: 1-1,000,000 (integer only)
- Supported rule types: all content, specified file type, specified folder, and specified file. Regular matching is currently not supported.
- Rules are executed from bottom to top. Rules at the bottom have higher priority.

### Configuration instructions

You can toggle the switch on to deploy the configured speed limit rule to nodes over the entire CDN network:

If a user accesses the resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/test.mp4`, the server will return the content at the configured downstream speed of 200 KB/s.
If a user accesses the resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/test.flv`, the server will return the content at the configured downstream speed of 400 KB/s.
