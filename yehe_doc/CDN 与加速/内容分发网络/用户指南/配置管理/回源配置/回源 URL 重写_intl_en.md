## Configuration Overview

If you need to modify the origin-pull request URL to the URL that matches the origin server, you can use the origin URL rewrite configuration in Tencent Cloud CDN.



## Configuration Guide

### Viewing configuration

Log in to the [CDN console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), select **Domain Management** on the left sidebar, click **Manage** on the right of a domain name to enter its configuration page, and switch to the **Origin-pull Configuration** tab to find the **Origin URL Rewrite Configuration** section.

**Configuration limitations**

- Each domain name can have up to 10 rewrite rules.
- You can adjust the priority for multiple rules. Rules are ranked by their priorities from lowest the highest.
- Current Origin URL: starting with `/`; supporting full-path matching (e.g., /test/a.jpg) and wildcard (*) matching (e.g., /test/*/*.jpg).
- Target Origin Domain: the current domain name is used by default (excluding `http://` and `https://`). You can modify it as needed.
- Target Origin Path: starting with `/` (e.g., /newtest/b.jpg); the wildcard `*` can be captured with `$n` (e.g., if n=1,2,3â€¦ then /newtest/$1/$2.jpg).
- The target origin domain can contain up to 250 characters. Other content can contain up to 1,024 characters. Chinese characters are not supported.



## Configuration Samples:

Suppose the **Origin URL Rewrite Configuration** of the acceleration domain name `www.test.com` is as follows:

Then 

- The origin-pull request `www.test.com/test/` wil be changed to `www.test.com/newtest/`.
- The origin-pull request `www.test.com/test/a.jpg` will be changed to `www.newtest.com/newtest/a.jpg`.
