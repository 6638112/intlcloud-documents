### Why can't CDN hide an IP completely?
1. The IP was already exposed before CDN is used.

3. There are multiple websites on the server, and if other domain names are not connected to CDN, the IP may be exposed.

### What does a hot backup origin server do?
If your primary origin server is an external one, you can add a hot backup origin server. All origin-pull requests will first be forwarded to the primary origin server.
