## Overview
COS Migration is an all-in-one tool that integrates the COS data migration feature. You can quickly migrate data from various sources to COS through simple configurations and steps. It has the following features:
- Diverse data sources:
   - Local data: Migrate locally stored data to COS.
   - URL list: Download and migrate data from specified URLs to COS.
   - Bucket replication: Data can be replicated among COS buckets. Cross-account and cross-region replication is supported.
- Checkpoint restart: Restarting uploads from checkpoints is supported. For large files, if the upload exits halfway or service failure occurs, you can run the tool again to restart the upload.
- Multipart upload: An object can be uploaded to COS by parts.
- Parallel upload: Multiple objects can be uploaded at the same time.
- Migration verification: Migrated objects can be verified.

>!
>- COS Migration only supports UTF-8 encoding.
>- If you use this tool to upload a file that already has the same name, the existing file will be overwritten. You need to configure the tool to skip files with the same name.
>- If you need to migrate from cloud storage service to COS, use the migration service platform.

## Operating Environment
#### Operating system
Windows, Linux, and macOS.

#### Software dependency
- JDK 1.8 x64 or later. For more information, see [Java](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10865).
- IFUNC needs to be supported on Linux and the binutils version should be later than 2.20.

## How to Use
### 1. Get the tool
Download COS Migration [here](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos_migrate_tool_v5).

### 2. Decompress the package
#### Windows
Decompress the package and save it to a directory, for example:
```plaintext
C:\Users\Administrator\Downloads\cos_migrate
```

#### Linux
Decompress the package and save it to a directory, for example:
```plaintext
unzip cos_migrate_tool_v5-master.zip && cd cos_migrate_tool_v5-master
```

#### Migration tool structure
The structure of the properly decompressed COS Migration tool is as follows:
```plaintext
COS_Migrate_tool
|——conf  #Directory of the configuration file
|   |——config.ini  #Migration configuration file
|——db    #Store the record of successful migrations
|——dep   #JAR package generated by compilation of the main logic of the program
|——log   #Log generated during tool execution
|——opbin #Script for compilation
|——src   #Source code of the tool
|——tmp   #Temporary file storage directory
|——pom.xml #Project configuration file
|——README  #Readme document
|——start_migrate.sh  #Migration start script for Linux
|——start_migrate.bat #Migration start script for Windows
```

>?
 - The `db` directory mainly records the IDs of files successfully migrated by the tool. Each migration job will first compare the records in the `db` directory. If the ID of the current file has already been recorded, the current file will be skipped; otherwise, it will be migrated.
 - The `log` directory keeps all the logs generated during tool migration. If an error occurs during migration, check `error.log` in this directory first.

### 3. Modify the config.ini file
Before running the migration start script, modify the `config.ini` file (path: `./conf/config.ini`) first. This file contains the following parts:

#### 3.1 Configure the migration type
`type` indicates the migration type, which you need to enter based on your migration needs. For example, to migrate local data to COS, configure `type=migrateLocal` for `[migrateType]`.
```plaintext
[migrateType]
type=migrateLocal
```

Currently, the following migration types are supported:

| Migration Type | Description |
| ------| ------ |
| migrateLocal | Migration from local system to COS. |
| migrateUrl | Migration from download URL to COS. |
| migrateBucketCopy| Migration from source bucket to destination bucket. |



#### 3.2 Configure the migration job
You can configure a migration job based on your actual needs, including its destination COS bucket information.
```plaintext
# The common configuration section of the migration tool includes account information to be migrated to the destination COS bucket.
[common]
secretId=COS_SECRETID
secretKey=COS_SECRETKEY
bucketName=examplebucket-1250000000
region=ap-guangzhou
storageClass=Standard
cosPath=/
https=off
tmpFolder=./tmp
smallFileThreshold=5242880
smallFileExecutorNum=64
bigFileExecutorNum=8
entireFileMd5Attached=on
daemonMode=off
daemonModeInterVal=60
executeTimeWindow=00:00,24:00
outputFinishedFileFolder=./result
resume=false
skipSamePath=false
```

| Name | Description | Default Value |
| ------| ------ |----- |
| secretId | `SecretId` of your key. Replace the value of `COS_SECRETID` with your key information, which can be obtained on the API key management page in the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). |-|
| secretKey | `SecretKey` of your key. Replace the value of `COS_SECRETKEY` with your key information, which can be obtained on the API key management page in the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). |-|
| bucketName | Name of the destination bucket in the format of `<BucketName-APPID>`. The bucket name must contain the `APPID`, such as `examplebucket-1250000000`. |-|
| region | Region information of the destination bucket. For the abbreviations for COS regions, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224). |-|
| storageClass| Storage class for the migrated data. Valid values: `Standard`, `Standard_IA`, `Archive`. For more information, see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).    |Standard|
| cosPath | COS path to migrate to. `/` indicates to migrate to the root path of the bucket, and `/folder/doc/` indicates to migrate to `/folder/doc/` in the bucket. If `/folder/doc/` does not exist, a path will be created automatically. |/|
| https | Whether to transfer over HTTPS. Valid values: on: Yes; off: No. It takes time to enable transfer over HTTPS, which is suitable for scenarios that demand high security. | off |
| tmpFolder | The directory used to store temporary files when data is migrated from another cloud storage service to COS, which will be deleted after the migration is completed. The format must be an absolute path: <br>Linux uses a slash (/) as the delimiter, for example, `/a/b/c`.<br>Windows uses two backlashes (\\) as the delimiter, for example, `E:\\a\\b\\c`.<br>The default value is the `tmp` directory in the path of the tool. | ./tmp |
| smallFileThreshold| Number of bytes as the threshold for small files. If the size is greater than or equal to this threshold, multipart upload will be used; otherwise, simple upload will be used. Default value: 5 MB | 5242880 |
| smallFileExecutorNum | Concurrency for uploading small files (smaller than `smallFileThreshold`) via simple upload. Decrease the concurrency if files are uploaded to COS over the public network with a low bandwidth. | 64 |
| bigFileExecutorNum | Concurrency for uploading large files (greater than or equal to `smallFileThreshold`) via multipart upload. Decrease the concurrency if files are uploaded to COS over the public network with a low bandwidth. | 8 |
| entireFileMd5Attached | The migration tool calculates the MD5 of the entire file and stores it in the `x-cos-meta-md5` custom header of the file for subsequent verification, because the ETag of a large file uploaded to COS via multipart upload is not the MD5 of the entire file. | on |
| daemonMode | Whether to enable daemon mode. Valid values: on: Yes; off: No. In daemon mode, the program will keep performing synchronization. The synchronization interval is configured by the `daemonModeInterVal` parameter. | off |
| daemonModeInterVal | Time interval in seconds between two rounds of synchronization. | 60 |
| executeTimeWindow | Execution time window with a granularity in minute, which defines the time period when the migration tool runs jobs. For example: <br>`03:30,21:00` means that jobs will be executed between 03:30 and 21:00, and the tool will be in sleep mode at other times, when the migration will be paused and the progress will be retained until the next time window when the migration will resume automatically. | 00:00,24:00 |
| outputFinishedFileFolder  | This directory stores the results of successful migration tasks, and the result files are named by date, for example, `./result/2021-05-27.out`, where `./result` is the created directory. Each line in the result files is in the format of `"Absolute path"\t"File size"\t"Last modified time"`. If `outputFinishedFileFolder` is left empty, no results will be output. | ./result |
| resume | Whether to continue with the result of the last run and traverse through the list of files from the source. The tool starts from scratch by default. | false |
| skipSamePath | Whether to skip the existing file if a file with the same name already exists in COS. By default, the tool does not skip the existing file; that is, it overwrites the existing file. | false |

#### 3.3 Configure the data source
Configure each section according to the migration type described in `[migrateType]`. For example, if `[migrateType]` is configured as `type=migrateLocal`, you will only need to configure the `[migrateLocal]` section.

**3.3.1 Configure a local data source migrateLocal**

To migrate from a local system to COS, configure this section. The specific configuration items and descriptions are as follows:
```plaintext
# Configuration for migration from a local system to COS
[migrateLocal]
localPath=E:\\code\\java\\workspace\\cos_migrate_tool\\test_data
excludes=
ignoreModifiedTimeLessThanSeconds=
```

| Configuration Item | Description |
| ------| ------ |
| localPath | Absolute path of the local directory <ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>Linux uses a slash (/) as the delimiter, for example, `/a/b/c`. </li><li>Windows uses two backlashes (\\) as the delimiter, for example, `E:\\a\\b\\c`.</li></ul> |
| excludes | Absolute path of the directory or file to be excluded, indicating some directories or files under `localPath` are not to be migrated. Multiple absolute paths need to be separated by semicolons. If this is left blank, all files under `localPath` will be migrated. |
| ignoreModifiedTimeLessThanSeconds | Exclude files that have an update time less than a certain period of time from the current time (in seconds). This item is left blank by default, indicating files are not to be filtered by the time specified by `lastmodified`. It is suitable for scenarios where you run the migration tool while updating files and don't want files being updated to be migrated to COS. For example, if it is configured as `300`, only files updated at least 5 minutes ago will be uploaded. |

**3.3.2 Configure a URL list data source migrateUrl**

If you migrate from a specified URL list to COS, configure this section. The specific configuration items and descriptions are as follows:
```plaintext
# Configuration for migration from a URL list to COS
[migrateUrl]
urllistPath=D:\\folder\\urllist.txt
```

| Configuration Item | Description |
| ------| ------ |
|urllistPath| Address of the URL list file. </br>Note: For this configuration item, enter the **local address** of the text file instead of specific URLs. The file should contain one original URL address per line (such as `http://aaa.bbb.com/yyy/zzz.dat`; no need to add any double quotation marks or other symbols). </br>The address of the URL list must be an absolute path: <ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>Linux uses a slash (/) as the delimiter, for example, `/a/b/c.txt` </li><li>Windows uses two backlashes (\\) as the delimiter, for example, `E:\\a\\b\\c.txt` </li><li>If a directory is entered, all files under the directory will be treated as URL list files for scan and migration.</li></ul> |


**3.3.6 Configure bucket replication migrateBucketCopy**

To migrate from one COS bucket to another bucket, configure this section. The specific configuration items and descriptions are as follows:
>!The account that initiates the migration needs to have permissions to read the source bucket and write to the destination bucket.

```plaintext
# Configuration for migration from source bucket to destination bucket
[migrateBucketCopy]
srcRegion=ap-shanghai
srcBucketName=examplebucket-1250000000
srcSecretId=COS_SECRETID
srcSecretKey=COS_SECRETKEY
srcCosPath=/
```

| Configuration Item | Description |
| ------| ------ |
|srcRegion| Region information of the source bucket. For more information, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224). |
|srcBucketName| Name of the source bucket in the format of `<BucketName-APPID>`. The bucket name must include the `APPID`, such as `examplebucket-1250000000`. |
|srcSecretId| `SecretId` of the user who owns the source bucket, which can be viewed on the [API key management page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). If the data is owned by the same user, `srcSecretId` is the same as the `SecretId` in the `common` section; otherwise, the migration is cross-account bucket copy. |
|srcSecretKey| `secret_key` of the user who owns the source bucket, which can be viewed on the [API key management page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). If the data is owned by the same user, `srcSecretKey` is the same as the `secretKey` in the `common` section; otherwise, the migration is cross-account bucket copy. |
|srcCosPath| COS path of the files to be migrated, indicating files in this path will be migrated to the destination bucket. |

### 4. Run the migration tool
#### Windows
Double-click **start_migrate.bat** to run the tool.

#### Linux
1. Run the following command to read the configuration from the `config.ini` file:
```plaintext
sh start_migrate.sh
```
2. Run the following command to read the configuration from command lines for some parameters:
```plaintext
sh start_migrate.sh -Dcommon.cosPath=/savepoint0403_10/
```

>?
>- The tool supports reading configuration items in two ways: command line or configuration file.
>- The command line takes priority over the configuration file, i.e., for the same configuration item, parameters in command lines take priority.
>- Reading configuration items from command lines allows you to run different migration jobs at the same time, provided that key configuration items (such as bucket name, COS path, and source path to be migrated) in the two jobs are not exactly the same. Concurrent migration can be achieved because different migration jobs are written into different `db` directories. Refer to `db` information in the tool structure above.
>- Configuration items are in the format of **`-D{sectionName}.{sectionKey}={sectionValue}`**. `sectionName` is the section name of the configuration file. `sectionKey` is the name of the configuration item in the section. `sectionValue` is the value of the configuration item in the section. The COS path to which data is to be migrated should be in the format of **`-Dcommon.cosPath=/bbb/ddd`**.

## Migration Mechanism and Process
### Migration mechanism

COS Migration has a status. Successful migrations will be recorded in the format of `KV` in the `leveldb` file under the `db` directory. Before each migration, check whether the path to which data is migrated has been recorded in the `db` directory. If yes, and its attribute is the same as that in `db`, the migration will be skipped; otherwise, the migration will be executed. The attribute varies by migration type. For local migration, `mtime` determines whether to migrate. For migration from other cloud storage services and bucket replication, the etag and length of the source file determine whether to migrate. Therefore, we search for records of successful migrations in the `db` directory rather than in COS. If a file is deleted or modified via COSCMD or the console rather than the migration tool, the migration tool cannot detect this change, and the file will not be re-migrated.

### Migration process

1. The configuration file is read, the configuration section is read according to the migration type, and parameters are checked.
2. The IDs of the files to be migrated are scanned and compared in the `db` directory according to the specified migration type to determine whether upload is allowed.
3. The execution results are printed out during migration, where `inprogress` indicates migration is in progress, `skip` indicates skipped, `fail` indicates failed, `ok` indicates succeeded, and `condition_not_match` indicates file fails to meet migration conditions (such as `lastmodified` and `excludes`) and is skipped. Details about the failure can be viewed in the error log. The execution process is as shown below:
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7561d07ea315c9bacbb228b36d6ad6d6.png)
4. Statistics are printed out after the migration is completed, which include the total number of migrated, failed, and skipped files as well as the amount of time consumed. In case of failures, check the error log or rerun the migration job as the migration tool will skip successfully migrated files and retry migrating failed ones. The execution result of a migration job is as shown below:
