## Feature

COSCMD enables users to perform batch operations such as upload/download/delete on objects using simple command lines.

> !This tool does not detect filename duplication. Uploading a file with the same name will overwrite the existing file.

## Operating Environment

#### System environment

Windows, Linux, and macOS.

> ?
> - Local characters should be in UTF-8 format; otherwise, exceptions will occur when operating on Chinese files.
> - Please make sure that the local time is in sync with UTC. The tool malfunctions when the time is drastically out of sync.

#### Software requirements

- Python 2.7/3.5/3.6.
- Latest version of Pip.

#### Installation and configuration

- For more information about the installation and configuration of the environment, see [Python](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10866).
- For more information about the installation and configuration of pip, see [pip Installation Instructions](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

## Download and Installation

#### Installing Pip

Run the `pip` command to install:

```plaintext
pip install coscmd
```

 After installation completes, you can view information on the current version by running the `-v` or `--version` command.

#### Updating Pip

Run the `pip` command to update:

```plaintext
pip install coscmd -U
```

> ! If the pip version number is greater than or equal to 10.0.0, a failure may occur when upgrading or installing dependent libraries. It is recommended to use pip v9.x (pip install pip==9.0.0).

#### Source code installation (not recommended)

Click [here](https://github.com/tencentyun/coscmd.git) to download the source code.

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/tencentyun/coscmd.git
cd coscmd
python setup.py install
```

> !With Python v2.6, we recommend using this method because a failure is likely to occur when installing pip dependent libraries.

#### Offline installation

> ! Please make sure that the version of Python on the two computers is the same; otherwise, the installation will fail.

```sh
# Run the following commands on a computer connected to the Internet
mkdir coscmd-packages
pip download coscmd -d coscmd-packages
tar -czvf coscmd-packages.tar.gz coscmd-packages

# Copy the installer package to a server without a public IP and run the following command.

### Configuring parameters

You need to configure parameters before using COSCMD. Run the following command for configuration:

```plaintext
coscmd config [OPTION]...<FILE>...
			  [-h] --help
			  [-a] <SECRET_ID>
			  [-s] <SECRET_KEY>
			  [-t] <TOKEN>
			  [-b] <BucketName-APPID>
              [-r] <REGION> | [-e] <ENDPOINT>
              [-m] <MAX_THREAD>
              [-p] <PART_SIZE>
              [--do-not-use-ssl]
              [--anonymous]   
```

Generally, you only need simple configuration, as shown in the sample below.

```shell
coscmd config -a AChT4ThiXAbpBDEFGhT4ThiXAbp**** -s WE54wreefvds3462refgwewe**** -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing
```

> ?Here, fields in "[]" are optional, while those in "<>" are required.

Parameters are configured as below:

> ?
> 1. You can directly edit the `~/.cos.conf` file (which is a hidden file in **My Documents** on Windows). This file does not exist at first and is generated by the `coscmd config` command. You can also create it manually.
> File content of the configured `.cos.conf` file is shown below:
 ```plaintext
 [common]
 secret_id = AChT4ThiXAbpBDEFGhT4ThiXAbp****
 secret_key = WE54wreefvds3462refgwewe****
 bucket = examplebucket-1250000000
 region = ap-beijing
 max_thread = 5
 part_size = 1
 schema = https
 ```
 ```
> 2. Add `schema` in the configuration file to select `http/https`. The default value is `https`.
> 3. You can use the anonymous mode by selecting `True/False` in the `anonymous` item, i.e. the signature will be empty.



### Specifying the commands for bucket and region

- Specify a bucket by `-b <BucketName-APPID>`.
- The bucket name entered here must be in the format of BucketName-APPID.
- Specify a region by `-r <region>`.

â€‹```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd -b <BucketName-APPID> -r <region> <action> ...
#Example - Create a bucket
coscmd -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing createbucket
#Example - Upload a file
coscmd -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing upload exampleobject exampleobject
 ```

### Creating a bucket

- We recommend you use this command together with `-b <BucketName-APPID>` and `-r <region>`.

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd -b <BucketName-APPID> createbucket
#Example
coscmd createbucket
coscmd -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing createbucket
```

### Deleting a bucket

- We recommend you use this command together with `-b <BucketName-APPID>` and `-r <region>`.

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd -b <BucketName-APPID> deletebucket
#Example
coscmd deletebucket
coscmd -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing deletebucket
coscmd -b examplebucket-1250000000 -r ap-beijing deletebucket -f
```
- Using the `-f` parameter will forcibly delete the bucket, including all files, noncurrent folders after versioning is enabled, and incomplete multipart uploads.

### Uploading a file or folder

- The command for file upload is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd upload <localpath> <cospath>
#Example
#Upload the local /data/exampleobject file to the data/exampleobject path in COS
coscmd upload /data/exampleobject data/exampleobject 
coscmd upload /data/exampleobject data/
#Upload a file by specifying a header
#Specify the object type to upload an archived file
coscmd upload /data/exampleobject data/exampleobject -H "{'x-cos-storage-class':'Archive'}"
#Configure metadata
coscmd upload /data/exampleobject data/exampleobject -H "{'x-cos-meta-example':'example'}"
```

- The command for folder upload is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd upload -r <localpath> <cospath>
#Example
coscmd upload -r /data/examplefolder data/examplefolder
#The storage path in COS is examplefolder2/examplefolder
coscmd upload -r /data/examplefolder examplefolder2/
#Upload to the bucket root directory
coscmd upload -r /data/examplefolder/ /
#Upload files synchronously while skipping those with the same md5
coscmd upload -rs /data/examplefolder data/examplefolder
#Upload files synchronously while deleting those that have been deleted locally
coscmd upload -rs --delete /data/examplefolder data/examplefolder
#Ignore .txt and .doc files
coscmd upload -rs /data/examplefolder data/examplefolder --ignore *.txt,*.doc
```

 Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the local file to be uploaded (localpath) and the storage path in COS (cospath).

> !
> - When uploading a file, you need to fill in the path in COS plus the name of the file (folder) (see the examples).
> - COSCMD supports resuming from upload breakpoint for large files. When the multipart upload of large files failed, only the failed slices will be uploaded instead of starting over from scratch during re-upload (please ensure that the directory and content of the re-uploaded file are consistent with the uploaded directory).
> - COSCMD performs MD5 verification on each part in multipart upload.
> - The `x-cos-meta-md5` header is included by default when COSCMD uploads a file, and its value is the same as the fileâ€™s `MD5` value.
> - Use the `-s` parameter to upload files synchronously while skipping those with the same MD5 (only if the source files in COS are uploaded using COSCMD v1.8.3.2 or above; the `x-cos-meta-md5` header is included by default).
> - When setting the HTTP header using the -H parameter, please make sure that the format is JSON, such as `coscmd upload -H "{'x-cos-storage-class':'Archive','Content-Language':'zh-CN'}" <localpath> <cospath>`. For more headers, see [PUT Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7749).
> - You can ignore a certain type of files using the `--ignore` parameter when uploading files. Multiple Shell wildcard rules (separated by commas `,`) are supported. To ignore a specified file extension, `,` or `""` must be added at the end.
> - Currently, a single file of up to 40 TB can be uploaded.

### Downloading a file or folder

- The command for file download is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd download <cospath> <localpath>
#Example
coscmd download data/exampleobject /data/exampleobject
coscmd download data/exampleobject /data/
```
- The command for folder download is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd download -r <cospath> <localpath>
#Example
coscmd download -r data/examplefolder/ /data/examplefolder
coscmd download -r data/examplefolder/ /data/
#Download all the files in the current bucket root directory and overwrite local files
coscmd download -rf / /data/examplefolder
#Download all the files in the current bucket root directory synchronously while skipping those with the same MD5
coscmd download -rs / /data/examplefolder
#Download all the files in the current bucket root directory synchronously while deleting existing local files that have been deleted in the cloud
coscmd download -rs --delete / /data/examplefolder
#Ignore .txt and .doc files
coscmd download -rs / /data/examplefolder --ignore *.txt,*.doc
```

Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the file to be downloaded in COS (cospath) and the local storage path (localpath).

> !
> - Since the old `mget` API has been deprecated, please use the `download` API that performs multipart downloads.
> - If a file with the same name exists locally, the download will fail. You need to use the `-f` parameter to overwrite the local file.
> - Use the `-s` or `--sync` parameter to skip identical local files when downloading a folder (provided that the downloaded files were uploaded via the upload API of COSCMD and the `x- cos-meta-md5` header was included).
> - You can ignore a certain type of files using the `--ignore` parameter when downloading files. Multiple Shell wildcard rules (separated by commas `,`) are supported. To ignore a specified file extension, `,` or `""` must be added at the end.

### Deleting a file or folder

- The command for file deletion is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd delete <cospath>
#Example
coscmd delete data/exampleobject

```

- The command for folder deletion is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd delete -r <cospath>
#Example
coscmd delete -r /data/examplefolder/
coscmd delete -r /
```

 Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the file to be deleted in COS (cospath). You will be prompted to confirm this operation.

> !You need to enter `y` to confirm a batch delete. This step can be skipped if the `-f` parameter is used.

### Viewing incomplete multipart uploads

- The command is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd listparts <cospath>
#Example
coscmd listparts examplefolder/
```

#Example
coscmd abort
```

### Copying a file or folder

- The command for copying files is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd copy <sourcepath> <cospath> 
#Example
#Copy the object in data/exampleobject in the bucket examplebucket2-1250000000 to data/examplefolder/exampleobject in the bucket examplebucket1-1250000000
coscmd -b examplebucket1-1250000000 -r ap-guangzhou copy examplebucket2-1250000000.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/data/exampleobject data/examplefolder/exampleobject
#Change the storage class of the file to STANDARD_IA
coscmd -b examplebucket1-1250000000 -r ap-guangzhou copy examplebucket2-1250000000.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/data/exampleobject data/examplefolder/exampleobject -H "{'x-cos-storage-class':'STANDARD_IA'}"
#Change the storage class of the file to ARCHIVE
coscmd -b examplebucket1-1250000000 -r ap-guangzhou copy examplebucket2-1250000000.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/data/exampleobject data/examplefolder/exampleobject -H "{'x-cos-storage-class':'Archive'}"
```

- The command for copying folders is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd copy -r <sourcepath> <cospath>
#Example
#Copy the directory examplefolder in the bucket examplebucket2-1250000000 to the directory examplefolder in the bucket examplebucket1-1250000000
coscmd -b examplebucket1-1250000000 -r ap-guangzhou copy -r examplebucket2-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/examplefolder/ examplefolder
coscmd -b examplebucket1-1250000000 -r ap-guangzhou copy -r examplebucket2-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/examplefolder/ examplefolder/

```

Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the COS source file (sourcepath) and the path of the COS destination file (cospath) to be copied.

> ?
> - The source path is in the format of `<BucketName-APPID>.cos.<region>.myqcloud.com/<cospath>`.
> - Use the `-d` parameter to set the `x-cos-metadata-directive` header (Valid values: Copy and Replaced; default: Copy).
> - When setting the HTTP header using the `-H` parameter, please make sure that the format is JSON, such as `coscmd copy -H -d Replaced "{'x-cos-storage-class':'Archive','Content-Language':'zh-CN'}" <localpath> <cospath>`. For more headers, see [PUT Object - Copy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10881).

### Querying file list

The command for querying is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd list <cospath>

#Example
#Recursively query the list of all files in the bucket
coscmd list -ar
#Recursively query the list of all files prefixed with examplefolder
coscmd list examplefolder/  -ar
```

Replace parameter in "<>" with the path of the file list to be queried in COS (cospath).

- Use `-a` to query all files.
- Use `-r` to query files recursively. The number and total size of files are listed at the end of the returned result.
- Use `-n num` to set the maximum number of files to be queried.

>?If `<cospath>` is empty, the current bucket root directory will be queried by default.

### Displaying file information

The command is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd info <cospath> 

#Example
coscmd info exampleobject
```

Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the file to be displayed on COS (cospath).

### Getting signed download URLs

The command is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd signurl <cospath>

#Example
coscmd signurl exampleobject
coscmd signurl exampleobject -t 100
```

Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the file in COS for which you need to get the download URL (cospath).
Use `-t time` to configure the validity period in seconds of the query signature.

### Enabling and suspending versioning

The command is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd putbucketversioning <status>

#Enable versioning
coscmd putbucketversioning Enabled

#Suspend versioning
coscmd putbucketversioning Suspended
```

Replace parameters in "<>" with the desired status of versioning.

> !Once versioning is enabled for the bucket, it cannot return to the prior status (initial status). However, you can suspend versioning for the bucket so that subsequent uploads of objects will not generate multiple versions.

### Restoring an archived file

- The command for restoring files is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd restore <cospath>
#Example
coscmd restore -d 3 -t Expedited exampleobject
```

- The command for restoring archived files in batches is as follows:

```plaintext
#Command format
coscmd restore -r <cospath>
#Example
coscmd restore -r -d 3 -t Expedited examplefolder/
```

 Replace parameters in "<>" with the path of the file list to be queried in COS (cospath).

- Use `-d day` to configure the validity period of the temporary replica. Default value: 7.
- Use `-t tier` to specify the restoring type. Enumerated value: Expedited, Standard, and Bulk. Default value: Standard.

### Command for debugging mode

If `-d` or `-debug` is added before a command, detailed operation information will be displayed when executing on the command. Below is an example:

```plaintext
#Display the upload details using a command in the format as follows:
