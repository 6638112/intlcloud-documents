- In the list view, click the Share icon on the right of the object to generate a URL and copy it. If the file is public-read, the URL will not carry a signature and be valid permanently. If the file is private-read, the URL will carry a signature and be valid for 2 hours.
- Right-click a file and select **Copy Link** to generate a URL and copy it. If the file is public-read, the URL will not carry a signature and be valid permanently. If the file is private-read, the URL will carry a signature and be valid for 2 hours.
- On the file detail page, click **Create link with expires** to set the temporary URL, URL type, and validity period for the specified endpoint (available only when a CDN acceleration endpoint is enabled).
