If you are a first time user of COS, we recommend you first read [Bucket Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312), [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324), [Specifications and Limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14518), and [General](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6282).

COSBrowser is a GUI-enabled tool provided by COS. Available on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, it provides an easier way to view, transfer, and manage COS resources.
This document uses the Windows version as an example to show you in detail how to create buckets, and upload, download, and share objects.

 - Name: A user-defined bucket name, for example, `examplebucket`
 - Region: Region where the bucket resides. Select the region closest to you. For example, if you are in Shenzhen, you can select the Guangzhou region, i.e., `ap-guangzhou`.
 - ACL: Access permission for the bucket. For example, you can select **Private (read-write)**.
3. Click **OK**.


## Step 4. Upload an object

1. Click the bucket created in Step 3 to go to the bucket management page.
2. Click **Upload** > **Select Files** and select a local file to upload to the bucket, for example, `exampleobjext.txt`.
3. Click **Upload**.


## Step 5. Download an object

#### Option 1


1. Click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b3de2bc7284b5aaba9b4f9af6c408205.jpg" style="margin:0;"> in the upper-right of the COSBrowser page to switch to list view (Skip this step if you are already in list view).
2. Under **Operation** on the right side, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0631f784902fb5e146ac0d0f6befe346.jpg"  style="margin:0;"> to download the file.

3. Click **Download now**. COSBrowser will start downloading the selected file.


## Step 6. Share an object

Each file stored in COS can be accessed through a specific link. If a file is private-read, you can request a temporary signature to generate a temporary access link with a certain validity period. The two methods for generating object links are as follows:

#### Option 1

1. Click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b3de2bc7284b5aaba9b4f9af6c408205.jpg" style="margin:0;"> in the upper-right of the COSBrowser page to switch to list view (Skip this step if you are already in list view).
2. In the action bar to the right of the file, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/37acaeb370eb77e1bb0c792d542792e2.jpg"  style="margin:0;">.
3. Your link is generated and copied successfully if COSBrowser displays **Temporary object url copy success, link effective for 2 hours** at the top.
4. You can now access your file via this link. File links generated in this way are valid for 2 hours. To customize the validity period, you can use option 2.


#### Option 2

1. Click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b3de2bc7284b5aaba9b4f9af6c408205.jpg" style="margin:0;"> in the upper-right of the COSBrowser page to switch to list view (Skip this step if you are already in list view).
1. In the **Operation** column of the target file, click **...**. In the drop-down list, click **Share**.

2. In the **Copy URL** pop-up window, configure your file URL. If your file is **Private read-write**, select **Signed URL, with validity**. Note that the URL is valid for the period of time you specify.
