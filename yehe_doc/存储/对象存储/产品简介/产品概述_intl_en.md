Cloud Object Storage (COS) is a powerful Tencent Cloud distributed storage service that features low costs and high scalability, reliability, and security. It enables you to store a massive number of files and view them on the cloud anytime.

You can easily and quickly access COS via the console, APIs, SDKs, or tools to store and manage massive data. You can leverage COSâ€™s user-friendly web management interface to upload, download, and manage files in different formats. CDN nodes around the globe also boost your file download speed.


## Product Features

COS provides both enterprises and individual users with a suite of features, including data management, remote disaster recovery, data access acceleration, and data processing for diverse use cases. For more information, see [Features](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8186).

## Concepts

This section describes key concepts that help you better understand COS.

- [Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312): A container for objects stored in COS. Each bucket can store an unlimited number of objects.
- [Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324): The basic unit of COS storage. It can be data in any format, such as image, document, audio, and video.
- [Region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A physical location where data centers are hosted in Tencent Cloud. COS data is stored in the buckets in these regions.
- [Endpoint](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A COS endpoint used to access and download an object stored in a bucket.



## Storage Classes

COS offers the following storage classes of objects: INTELLIGENT TIERING, STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. They indicate how active objects are in COS, and vary from one another in access frequency, durability, availability, latency, and more. You can choose which storage class to upload your data to based on your use case.

>? For comparison among COS storage classes, see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

### DEEP ARCHIVE

COS DEEP ARCHIVE is a highly reliable object storage service that offers the lowest storage costs and long-term data retention. This storage class has a minimum storage duration of 180 days. To read data stored in DEEP ARCHIVE, you need to restore it to STANDARD first.
