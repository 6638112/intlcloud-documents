You can easily and quickly access COS via the user-friendly web console, APIs, SDKs, or tools to upload, download, and manage massive amounts of data files in different formats. You can also leverage CDN nodes around the globe to accelerate COS file downloads.

## Concepts

This section describes key concepts that help you better understand COS.

- [Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312): A container for objects stored in COS. Each bucket can store an unlimited number of objects.
- [Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324): The basic unit of COS storage. It can be data in any format, such as image, document, audio, and video.
- [Region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A physical location where data centers are hosted in Tencent Cloud. COS data is stored in the buckets in these regions.
- [Endpoint](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224): A COS endpoint used to access and download an object stored in a bucket.
- [Storage class](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925): A storage level that indicates how active objects are in COS. COS offers multiple storage classes, including STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, INTELLIGENT TIERING, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. Different storage classes are suitable for different use cases and have different attributes, such as object access frequency and access latency.
