### Bucket

A bucket is an entity for objects, which can be considered as a "container" for stored objects. You can manage buckets and configure their attributes through various methods such as the Tencent Cloud console, APIs, and SDKs. For example, you can configure a bucket for static website hosting or access permission.

For more information, see [Bucket Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312).


### Object

An object is the basic unit of COS and is stored in a bucket just like a photo stored in an album. You can manage objects in different ways including Tencent Cloud console, APIs, and SDKs. An object is named in the format of `<ObjectKey>` in API and SDK examples.

For more information, see [Object Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13324).



### APPID

APPID is an application ID which you get after you successfully signed up to Tencent Cloud, and which has a unique one-to-one correspondence with your account ID. It is automatically assigned to you as a permanent unique ID, which can be viewed in [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer).

APPID is usually used in bucket names in a format of “custom string-APPID”, for example, `examplebucket-1250000000`.

### UID

APPID is also used to generate temporary keys, specify bucket policies, or specify a resource range for policy configuration in CAM. In these cases, APPID is also referred to as UID that shares the same value as APPID.

For more information, see [Bucket Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312), [Access Policy Language Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18023), and [Resource Description Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10606).


### UIN

Account ID, a permanent unique ID that has a unique one-to-one correspondence with your APPID, and can be viewed in [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer). In COS services, it is used to generate temporary keys, specify bucket policies, or specify a resource range for policy configuration in CAM, in ways similar to those for UID, but with a notable difference in their prefixes.

For more information, see [Access Policy Language Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18023) and [Resource Description Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10606).

### ACL

An access control list (ACL) is a resource-based option for access management, and is used to describe an access permission action.
In COS, you can use ACLs to manage the access to your buckets and objects by granting Read and Write permissions to other root accounts, sub-accounts, and user groups.

For more information, see [Basic Concepts of Access Control](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30581) and [ACL Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30583).

### CORS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which means that a resource in one domain initiates an HTTP request to a resource from another domain.


### SecretKey

SecretId and SecretKey are collectively referred to as cloud API key, which is the security credential used for authentication when a user accesses a Tencent Cloud API, and obtained in [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). SecretKey is the key used to encrypt the signature string and the server-side authentication signature string. Multiple cloud API keys can be created under an APPID.


### SecretId

SecretId and SecretKey are collectively referred to as the cloud API key, which is the security credential used for authentication when a user accesses a Tencent Cloud API, and obtained in [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi). SecretId is used to identify the API caller. Multiple cloud API keys can be created under an APPID.



### Policy

A policy is comprised of several elements used to describe permission details. For more information, see [Access Policy Language Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18023).


### Public network downstream traffic

Traffic of data transfer from COS to a client over the internet. It includes the traffic generated when you download objects using object URLs or browse objects through your static website origin.

### CDN origin-pull traffic
Traffic generated by data transfer from COS to Tencent Cloud CDN edge node</td>


### Default domain name
Domain name of COS origin. It is automatically generated based on your bucket name and region when you create a bucket, and should be distinguished from the default acceleration domain name. For more information, see [Domain Name Management Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18424).


### Default CDN acceleration domain name

A domain name accelerated by CDN cache nodes. It is generated by default, and you can choose to enable or disable it. For more information, see [Domain Name Management Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18424).


### Custom CDN acceleration domain name
A custom domain name that you bind for your bucket to the Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration platform, and use to access objects in your bucket. For more information, see [Domain Name Management Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18424).


### Custom origin domain name
A custom domain name that you bind to your bucket and use to access objects in it. For more information, see [Domain Name Management Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/18424).


### Data retrieval
STANDARD_IA and ARCHIVE are two COS storage classes that store cold data. To read or download infrequently-accessed data, COS needs to retrieve it first. Archived data cannot be read or downloaded until you unfreeze (retrieve) it, that is, restore it to STANDARD storage class first.



### Region


A region where Tencent Cloud data centers are hosted, and where you store your COS data in your bucket.

For more information, see [Regions and Access Endpoints](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224).
