COS launched the metadata acceleration feature to provide high-performance file system features. Metadata acceleration leverages of the powerful metadata management feature of Cloud HDFS (CHDFS) at the underlying layer to allow users to use file system semantics to access COS. The system design metrics can reach a bandwidth of up to 2.4 GB/s, over 100,000 queries per second (QPS), and a latency of milliseconds. Buckets with metadata acceleration enabled can be widely used in scenarios such as big data, high-performance computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

If you havenâ€™t enabled metadata acceleration for a bucket, it cannot accelerate metadata access by default and does not support access with POSIX file semantics, making it less favorable in terms of file `LIST` and not support `RENAME`. After enabling metadata acceleration, you can use POSIX file semantics to access objects in buckets through native COS APIs or the Hadoop tool deployed on the client side, the console, or SDKs.

>! Metadata acceleration can only be enabled upon bucket creation and cannot be disabled once enabled. Please **think twice** before enabling it.
