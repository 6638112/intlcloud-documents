## Overview

This document provides an overview of APIs and SDK code samples related to object deletion.

| API | Operation | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [DELETE Object](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/7743) | Deleting an object | Deletes an object from a bucket. |
| [DELETE Multiple Objects](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/8289) | Deleting multiple objects | Deletes multiple objects from a bucket. |


## Deleting a Single Object

#### Description

This API (`DELETE Object`) is used to delete a specified object.

#### Method prototype

```
delete_object(Bucket, Key, **kwargs)
```
#### Sample 1. Deleting an object

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
import sys
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print the communication information of the client.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = 'SecretId'     # Replace it with the actual SecretId, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
secret_key = 'SecretKey'     # Replace it with the actual SecretKey, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

response = client.delete_object(
    Bucket='examplebucket-1250000000',
    Key='exampleobject'
)
```

#### Sample 2. Deleting a directory

In COS, a directory is an object whose path ends with a slash (/). Therefore, you can call the `Delete Object` API to delete a directory.

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
import sys
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print the communication information of the client.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = 'SecretId'     # Replace it with the actual SecretId, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
secret_key = 'SecretKey'     # Replace it with the actual SecretKey, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

to_delete_dir='path/to/delete/dir/'
response = client.delete_object(
    Bucket='examplebucket-1250000000',
    Key=to_delete_dir,
)
print(response)
```

#### Sample 3: Deleting objects with a specified prefix

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client

import sys
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print the communication information of the client.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = 'SecretId'     # Replace it with the actual SecretId, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
secret_key = 'SecretKey'     # Replace it with the actual SecretKey, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, see https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This field is optional and is `https` by default

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

# Delete objects with the specified prefix.
bucket = 'examplebucket-1250000000'
is_over = False
marker = ''
prefix = 'root/logs'
while not is_over:
    response = client.list_objects(Bucket=bucket, Prefix=prefix, Marker=marker)
    if response['Contents']:
        for content in response['Contents']:
            print("delete object: ", content['Key'])
            client.delete_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=content['Key'])

        if response['IsTruncated'] == 'false':
            is_over = True
            marker = response['Marker']
```

## Deleting Multiple Objects (Deleting a Directory)

#### Description
COS does not have the concept of directories, but you can use slashes (/) as the delimiter to simulate directories.

In COS, deleting a directory and the objects contained actually means deleting objects that have the same specified prefix. Currently, COSâ€™s Python SDK does not provide a standalone API to perform this operation. However, you can still do so with a combination of basic operations (query object list + batch delete objects).

#### Sample request
```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
from qcloud_cos.cos_threadpool import SimpleThreadPool
import os
import sys
import logging

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print the communication information of the client.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = 'SecretId'     # Replace it with the actual SecretId, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi

def delete_cos_dir():
    pool = SimpleThreadPool()
    marker = ""
    while True:
        file_infos = []

        # List 100 objects in a response.
        response = client.list_objects(Bucket=bucket, Prefix=folder, Marker=marker, MaxKeys=100)

        if "Contents" in response:
            contents = response.get("Contents")
            file_infos.extend(contents)
            pool.add_task(delete_files, file_infos)

        # Quit after the listing.
        if response['IsTruncated'] == 'false':
            break
        
        # Get the next response.
        marker = response["NextMarker"]

    pool.wait_completion()
    return None   

def delete_files(file_infos):

    # Construct the batch delete request.
    delete_list = []
    for file in file_infos:
        delete_list.append({"Key": file['Key']})

    response = client.delete_objects(Bucket=bucket, Delete={"Object": delete_list})
    print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
