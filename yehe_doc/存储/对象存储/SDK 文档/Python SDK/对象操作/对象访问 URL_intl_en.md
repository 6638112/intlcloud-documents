## Overview

This document provides an overview of the API and sample code for getting an object access URL.

## Getting an Object Access URL

#### Description

The SDK allows you to obtain object access URLs for anonymous download or distribution.

#### Method prototype

```
get_object_url(Bucket, Key)
```

#### Sample request

```python
# -*- coding=utf-8
from qcloud_cos import CosConfig
from qcloud_cos import CosS3Client
import sys
import logging
import requests

# In most cases, set the log level to INFO. If you need to debug, you can set it to DEBUG and the SDK will print the communication information of the client.
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, stream=sys.stdout)

# 1. Set user attributes such as secret_id, secret_key, and region. Appid has been removed from CosConfig and thus needs to be specified in Bucket, which is formatted as BucketName-Appid.
secret_id = 'SecretId'     # Replace it with the actual SecretId, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
secret_key = 'SecretKey'     # Replace it with the actual SecretKey, which can be viewed and managed at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
region = 'ap-beijing'      # Replace it with the actual region, which can be viewed in the console at https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket
                           # For the list of regions supported by COS, see https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224
token = None               # Token is required for temporary keys but not permanent keys. For more information about how to generate and use a temporary key, see https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048
scheme = 'https'           # Specify whether to use HTTP or HTTPS protocol to access COS. This is optional and is https by default.

config = CosConfig(Region=region, SecretId=secret_id, SecretKey=secret_key, Token=token, Scheme=scheme)
client = CosS3Client(config)

# Generate a URL
url = client.get_object_url(
    Bucket='examplebucket-1250000000',
    Key='exampleobject'
)
print(url)

# Use the URL
response = requests.get(url)
print(response)
```
