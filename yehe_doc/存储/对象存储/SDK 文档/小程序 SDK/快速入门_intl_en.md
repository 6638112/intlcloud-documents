#### Installing SDK

There are two ways to install the SDK for WeChat Mini Programs: manual installation and installation through npm as detailed below.

#### Installing manually

Copy the [cos-wx-sdk-v5.js](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-wx-sdk-v5/blob/master/demo/lib/cos-wx-sdk-v5.js) file in the source code directory to any path in the root directory of your WeChat Mini Program code and reference it using a relative path:

```js
var COS = require('./lib/cos-wx-sdk-v5.js')
```

#### Installing through npm

If the code of your WeChat Mini Program is packaged using webpack, install the dependencies via npm:

```plaintext
npm install cos-wx-sdk-v5
```

The WeChat Mini Program code is referenced with `var COS = require('cos-wx-sdk-v5');`.

## Getting Started

### Configuring domain name whitelist for WeChat Mini Programs

To request COS in your WeChat Mini Program, you need to log in to the [WeChat Official Accounts Platform](https://mp.weixin.qq.com) and configure the domain allowlist by navigating to **Development** > **Development Settings** > **Server Domain Name**. The SDK uses the following two APIs:

1. For cos.postObject, use the wx.uploadFile API.
2. For other methods, use the wx.request API.

For both methods, you need to configure the COS domain name. There are two forms of domain name whitelists.

1. For standard requests, you can configure the bucket domain name as the whitelist domain name, for example:
   `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com`
2. If multiple buckets are used in your WeChat Mini Program, you can choose to use suffixed COS requests by passing in `ForcePathStyle: true` when instantiating the SDK. In this case, you need to configure the region domain name as the whitelist, such as `cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com`.

### Initialization

```js
var COS = require('./lib/cos-wx-sdk-v5.js')
```

```js
var cos = new COS({
    // ForcePathStyle: true, // If multiple buckets are used, you can use suffixed requests to reduce the number of whitelisted domain names to be configured; the region domain name will be used for requests.
    getAuthorization: function (options, callback) {
        // Get a temporary key asynchronously.
        wx.request({
            url: 'https://example.com/server/sts.php',
            data: {
                bucket: options.Bucket,
                region: options.Region,
            },
            dataType: 'json',
            success: function (result) {
                var data = result.data;
                var credentials = data && data.credentials;
                if (!data || !credentials) return console.error('credentials invalid');
                callback({
                    TmpSecretId: credentials.tmpSecretId,
                    TmpSecretKey: credentials.tmpSecretKey,
                    XCosSecurityToken: credentials.sessionToken,
                    // We recommend using the time the server receives the credentials as the StartTime, so as to avoid signature error due to time deviations. 
                    StartTime: data.startTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000000
                    ExpiredTime: data.expiredTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000900
                });
            }
        });
    }
});

// The COS instance can then be used to call a COS request.
// TODO
```

### Configuration Item

#### Sample code

Create a COS SDK instance in the following methods:

- Method 1 (recommended): The backend gets a temporary key and sends it to the frontend for signature calculation.

```js
var cos = new COS({
    // Required parameter
    getAuthorization: function (options, callback) {
        // Server examples for JS and PHP: https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-js-sdk-v5/blob/master/server/
        // For server-side examples for other programming languages, see the COS SDK for STS: https://github.com/tencentyun/qcloud-cos-sts-sdk
        // For the STS documentation, visit https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/14048
        wx.request({
            url: 'https://example.com/server/sts.php',
            data: {
                // The required parameters can be obtained from options.
            },
            success: function (result) {
                var data = result.data;
                var credentials = data && data.credentials;
                if (!data || !credentials) return console.error('credentials invalid');
                callback({
                    TmpSecretId: credentials.tmpSecretId,
                    TmpSecretKey: credentials.tmpSecretKey,
                    XCosSecurityToken: credentials.sessionToken,
                    // We recommend using the time the server receives the credentials as the StartTime, so as to avoid signature error due to time deviations. 
                    StartTime: data.startTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000000
                    ExpiredTime: data.expiredTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000900
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
```

>

- Method 2 (recommended): Permissions are controlled in a more refined manner. The backend gets a temporary key and sends it to the frontend. The frontend reuses the key only for the same request, and the backend can granularly manage permissions through Scope.

```js
var cos = new COS({
    // Required parameter
    getAuthorization: function (options, callback) {
        // Server example: https://github.com/tencentyun/qcloud-cos-sts-sdk/edit/master/scope.md
        wx.request({
            url: 'https://example.com/server/sts-scope.php',
            data: JSON.stringify(options.Scope),
            success: function (result) {
                var data = result.data;
                var credentials = data && data.credentials;
                if (!data || !credentials) return console.error('credentials invalid');
                callback({
                    TmpSecretId: credentials.tmpSecretId,
                    TmpSecretKey: credentials.tmpSecretKey,
                    XCosSecurityToken: credentials.sessionToken,
                    // We recommend using the time the server receives the credentials as the StartTime, so as to avoid signature error due to time deviations. 
                    StartTime: data.startTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000000
                    ExpiredTime: data.expiredTime, // Timestamp in seconds, such as 1580000900
                    ScopeLimit: true, // Refined permission control needs to be set to true, limiting the key to be reused only for the same request
                });
            }
        });
    }
});
```

- Method 3 (not recommended): the frontend needs to get a signature through getAuthorization before each request, and the backend uses a permanent or temporary key to calculate the signature and returns it to the frontend. This method makes it difficult to control the permission to multipart uploads and thus is not recommended.

```js
var cos = new COS({
    // Required parameter
    getAuthorization: function (options, callback) {
        // The server obtains a signature. For more information, please see the COS SDK for the corresponding programming language: https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6474
        // Note: there may be a security risk associated with this method. The backend needs to strictly control permissions through method and pathname, such as prohibiting put /
        wx.request({
            url: 'https://example.com/server/auth.php',
            data: JSON.stringify(options.Scope),
            success: function (result) {
                var data = result.data;
                if (!data || !data.authorization) return console.error('authorization invalid');
                callback({
                    Authorization: data.authorization,
                    // XCosSecurityToken: data.sessionToken, // If a temporary key is used, sessionToken needs to be passed to XCosSecurityToken
                });
            }
        });
    },
});
```

- Method 4 (not recommended): the frontend uses a permanent key to calculate the signature. This method can be used for frontend debugging. If you use this method, be sure to avoid key disclosure.

```js
// Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) to check and manage the `SecretId` and `SecretKey` of your project.
var cos = new COS({
    SecretId: 'SECRETID',
    SecretKey: 'SECRETKEY',
});
```

#### Constructor parameters

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |

#### Getting an authentication credential

There are three ways to get the authentication credentials for your instance by passing in different parameters during instantiation:

1. During instantiation, pass in your `SecretId` and `SecretKey`, and each time a signature is required, it will be internally calculated by the instance.
2. During instantiation, pass in the `getAuthorization` callback function, and each time a signature is required, it will be calculated and returned to the instance through this callback.
3. During instantiation, pass in the `getSTS` callback, and each time a temporary key is required, it will be returned to the instance for signature calculation within the instance during each request.

Below are some examples of common APIs. For more detailed initialization methods, see the examples in the [demo](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-wx-sdk-v5/blob/master/demo/).

### Creating a bucket

```js
cos.putBucket({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
}, function (err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

>! If you need to create a bucket via the WeChat Mini Program, but the bucket name is unknown, you cannot configure the bucket name as a allowlisted domain name. Instead, you can use suffixed calls. For more information, please see [FAQs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10687).
>

### Querying the bucket list

```js
cos.getService(function (err, data) {
    console.log(data && data.Buckets);
});
```

### Uploading an object

The WeChat Mini Program upload API "wx.uploadFile" only supports POST requests. To upload files with the SDK, you need to use the postObject API. If only the file uploading API is needed in your WeChat Mini Program, we do not recommend referencing the SDK. For more information, please see the [demo](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-wx-sdk-v5/blob/master/demo/demo-no-sdk.js).

```js
// First, select the file to get the temporary path
wx.chooseImage({
    count: 1, // Default value: 9
    sizeType: ['original'], // You can specify whether to use the original or compressed image. The original is used by default value.
    sourceType: ['album', 'camera'], // You can specify whether the source is an album or camera. Both are included by default. 
    success: function (res) {
        var filePath = res.tempFiles[0].path;
        var filename = filePath.substr(filePath.lastIndexOf('/') + 1);
        cos.postObject({
            Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
            Region: 'ap-beijing',
            Key: 'destination path/' + filename,
            FilePath: filePath,
            onProgress: function (info) {
                console.log(JSON.stringify(info));
            }
        }, function (err, data) {
            console.log(err || data);
        });
    }
});
```

### Query objects

```js
cos.getBucket({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
    Prefix: 'exampledir/', // Pass in the file prefixes to be listed here
}, function (err, data) {
    console.log(err || data.Contents);
});
```

### Download an object

>! This API is used to read object content. To download a file using your browser, you should first get a download URL through the `cos.getObjectUrl` method. For more information, please see [Pre-signed URLs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31711).
>

```js
cos.getObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
    Key: 'exampleobject.txt',
}, function (err, data) {
    console.log(err || data.Body);
});
```

### Delete an object

```js
cos.deleteObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
    Key: 'picture.jpg',
}, function (err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```
