## Simple Operations

### Uploading object by using simple upload

#### Feature description

This API (`PUT Object`) is used to upload an object to a bucket. To call this API, you must have write access to the bucket.

> !
> 1. The key (filename) cannot end with `/`; otherwise, it will be identified as a folder.
> 2. Each root account (`APPID`) can have up to 1,000 bucket ACLs and an unlimited number of object ACLs. Do not configure ACLs for an object during upload if you don't need to control the access to it, in which case the object will inherit the permissions of its bucket by default.
> 3. After an object is uploaded, you can use the same key to generate a pre-signed URL, which can be shared with other clients for downloading. To download the object, use the `GET` method. The detailed API description is as follows. If your file is set to private-read, note that the pre-signed URL will only be valid for a certain period of time.

#### Sample code

Select a file and upload it (by using the `Body` parameter):

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-body)
```js
// The image selecting API (wx.chooseImage) is used as an example here. For other APIs, see the official documentation of WeChat Mini Program.
wx.chooseImage({
    count: 1,
    success: function(res) {
        var file = res.tempFiles[0];
        // Get the file manager in the WeChat mini program
        var wxfs = wx.getFileSystemManager();
        wxfs.readFile({
            filePath: file.path,
            success: function (res) {
                cos.putObject({
                    Bucket: config.Bucket,
                    Region: config.Region,
                    Key: file.name,
                    Body: res.data, // Pass in the content of the file to `Body`
                }, function(err, data) {
                    console.log(err || data);
                });
            },
            fail: function(err) {
              console.error(err)
            },
        });
    },
    fail: function(err) {
      console.error(err)
    },
});
```

Select a file and upload it (by using the `FilePath` parameter, for SDK 1.3.0 or later only):

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-filepath)
```js
// The image selecting API (wx.chooseImage) is used as an example here. For other APIs, see the official documentation of WeChat Mini Program.
wx.chooseImage({
    count: 1,
    success: function(res) {
        var file = res.tempFiles[0];
        cos.putObject({
            Bucket: config.Bucket,
            Region: config.Region,
            Key: file.name,
            FilePath: file.path,  // Pass in the file path to `FilePath`
        }, function(err, data) {
            console.log(err || data);
        });
    },
    fail: function(err) {
      console.error(err)
    },
});
```

Upload a string as the file content:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-string)
```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'picture.jpg',              /* Required */
    Body: 'hello!',
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Create a directory:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-folder)
```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'ap-beijing',    /* Required */
    Key: 'a/',              /* Required */
    Body: '',
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Upload an object (limit the single-URL speed):

>?For more information on the speed limits on object uploads, see [Single-Connection Bandwidth Limit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/34072).

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-put-object-traffic-limit)
```js
cos.putObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
    Key: 'exampleobject',              /* Required */
    StorageClass: 'STANDARD',
    Body: 'hello!', // Upload the file object (string or selected file)
    Headers: {
      'x-cos-traffic-limit': 819200, // The speed range is 819200â€“838860800, i.e., 100 KB/s to 100 MB/s. If a value is not within this range, 400 will be returned.
    },
    onProgress: function(progressData) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});

### Appending parts

#### Feature description

This API (`APPEND Object`) is used to upload an object to a bucket by appending parts.

> !
> - The COS Mini Program SDK version must be at least v1.1.1.
> - This API can append data only to appendable objects.
> - If an object is uploaded by using the `APPEND Object` API for the first time, it will be automatically determined as "appendable".
> - You can use the `GET Object` or `HEAD Object` API to get the `x-cos-object-type` response header to determine the object type.
> 

#### Sample code

Append parts for the first time:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.appendObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
    Key: 'test.txt',              /* Required */
    Body: fileObject, // Upload the file object
    Position: 0, // The value is `0` for the first upload.
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Check whether parts can be appended to an object in a bucket:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.headObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
    Key: 'test.txt',              /* Required */
}, function(err, data) {
    if (err) return console.log(err);
    // If `data.headers` does not contain the `x-cos-object-type` field, you need to configure `expose-headers`. For more information, visit https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13318.
    var objectType = data.headers['x-cos-object-type'];
    console.log(objectType === 'appendable');
});
```

Query the position of the object for parts appending and start upload:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-append-object)
```js
cos.headObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
    Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
    Key: 'test.txt',              /* Required */
}, function(err, data) {
    if (err) return console.log(err);
    // Get the current length (position for upload) of the file to be appended
    var position = data.headers['content-length'];
    cos.appendObject({
        Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
        Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
        Key: 'test.txt',              /* Required */
        Body: '66666',
        Position: position,
    },
    function(err, data) {
        if (err) return console.log(err);
        // Get the position for the next upload and continue appending parts
        // If `data.headers` does not contain the `x-cos-next-append-position` field, you need to configure `expose-headers`. For more information, visit https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13318.
        var nextPosition = data.headers['x-cos-next-append-position'];
        console.log(nextPosition);
    })
});
```

### Uploading object by using HTML form

This API (`POST Object`) is used to upload an object selected through `wx.chooseImage` to a specified bucket. To call this API, you must have write access to the bucket.

>! `onProgress` depends on the mini program's [UploadTask.onProgressUpdate](https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/dev/api/network/upload/UploadTask.onProgressUpdate.html). The progress might be inaccurate on some Android devices.

#### Sample code

Upload a file by using simple upload:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-post-object)
```js
cos.postObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
    Key: filename,
    FilePath: tmpFilePath, // The `tmpFilePath` obtained when you select the file through `wx.chooseImage`.
    onProgress: function(progressData) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
}, function (err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Upload a file to the specified directory:

```js
var folder = 'examplefolder/';
cos.postObject({
    Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000',
    Region: 'ap-beijing',
    Key: folder + filename,              /* Required */
    FilePath: tmpFilePath, // The `tmpFilePath` obtained when you select the file through `wx.chooseImage`.
    onProgress: function(progressData) {
        console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
    }
}, function(err, data) {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

### Completing multipart upload

#### Feature description

This API (`Complete Multipart Upload`) is used to complete a multipart upload. After all parts are uploaded via the `Upload Parts` API, you need to call this API to complete the multipart upload. When using this API, you need to specify the `PartNumber` and `ETag` of each part in the request body for the part information to be verified.
The parts need to be reassembled after they are uploaded, which takes several minutes. When the assembly starts, COS will immediately return the status code `200` and will periodically return spaces during the process to keep the connection active until the assembly is completed. After that, COS will return the assembled result in the body.

- If the uploaded part size is below 1 MB, `400 EntityTooSmall` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the uploaded part numbers are not continuous, `400 InvalidPart` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the part information entries in the request body are not sorted by number in ascending order, `400 InvalidPartOrder` will be returned when this API is called.
- If the `UploadId` does not exist, `404 NoSuchUpload` will be returned when this API is called.

>! We recommend you either complete or abort a multipart upload as early as possible, as the uploaded parts of an incomplete multipart upload will take up storage capacity and incur storage fees.

## Advanced APIs (Recommended)

The following methods encapsulate the native methods mentioned above. They can implement the complete process of multipart upload and support concurrent multipart upload, checkpoint restart, as well as canceling, pausing, and resuming upload tasks.

### Advanced upload

#### Feature description
    
This API (`Upload File`) is used to implement an advanced upload. You can use the `SliceSize` parameter to specify a file size threshold (1 MB by default). If a file is larger than this threshold, it will be uploaded in parts; otherwise, it will be uploaded in whole.
    
#### Sample code

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-file)
```js
var uploadFile = function(file) {
    cos.uploadFile({
        Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
        Region: 'COS_REGION',     /* Bucket region (required) */
        Key: file.name,              /* Required */
        FilePath: file.path,                /* Required */
        FileSize: file.size,                 /* Required for versions earlier than v1.4.3 and optional for v1.4.3 and later */
        SliceSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5,     /* The threshold (5 MB in this example) to trigger multipart upload (optional and customizable). Minimum value: 1 MB. */
        onTaskReady: function(taskId) {                   /* Optional */
            console.log(taskId);
        },
        onProgress: function (progressData) {           /* Optional */
            console.log(JSON.stringify(progressData));
        },
        onFileFinish: function (err, data, options) {   /* Optional */
          console.log(options.Key + 'upload' + (err ? 'failed' : 'completed'));
        },
    }, function(err, data) {
        console.log(err || data);
    });
}

wx.chooseMessageFile({
   count: 10,
   type: 'all',
   success: function(res) {
       uploadFiles(res.tempFiles[0]);
   }
});
```

### Batch upload

#### Feature description

Option 1:
You can call `putObject` or `sliceUploadFile` multiple times to implement batch uploads. Instantiate the `FileParallelLimit` parameter to limit the maximum number of concurrently uploaded files allowed, which is 3 by default.

Option 2:
You can call `cos.uploadFiles` to implement batch uploads. The `SliceSize` parameter can be used to set a size limit to determine whether multipart upload should be used. The following describes how to use the `uploadFiles` method:

#### Method prototype

Call `uploadFiles`:

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-batch-upload-objects)
```js
var uploadFiles = function(files) {
    var fileList = files.map(function(file) {
        return Object.assign(file, {

            FileSize: file.size, /* Required for versions earlier than v1.4.3 and optional for v1.4.3 and later */
            Bucket: 'examplebucket-1250000000', /* Required */
            Region: 'COS_REGION',/* Bucket region (required) */
            Key: file.name, /* Required */
            onTaskReady: function(taskId) {
              /* Based on `taskId`, you can use queue operations to cancel (`cos.cancelTask(taskId)`), pause (`cos.pauseTask(taskId)`), or resume (`cos.restartTask(taskId)`) the upload. */
              console.log(taskId);
            }
        });
    });
    cos.uploadFiles({
        files: fileList,
        SliceSize: 1024 * 1024 * 10,    /* Set the file size threshold to trigger a multipart upload to 10 MB. This parameter is customizable. Minimum value: 1 MB. */

### Upload queue

The Mini Program SDK records all the `putObject` upload tasks in a queue. Relevant queue operations are as follows:

1. Use `var taskList = cos.getTaskList()` to get the task list.
2. Use `cos.pauseTask()`, `cos.restartTask()`, or `cos.cancelTask()` to manage the task.
3. Use `cos.on('list-update', callback);` to listen for list and progress changes.

For detailed instructions on how to use the upload queue, see the queue demo at [GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/cos-js-sdk-v5/tree/master/demo/queue).

#### Canceling upload task

This API is used to cancel an upload task by `taskId`.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-cancel)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.cancelTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | ID of the upload task. When `putObject` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback. | String | Yes |

#### Pausing upload task

This API is used to pause an upload task by `taskId`.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-pause)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.pauseTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | ID of the upload task. When `putObject` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback. | String | Yes |

#### Resuming upload task

This API is used to resume an upload task by `taskId`. You can resume tasks that have been manually paused through the `pauseTask` API or automatically paused due to an upload error.

**Sample**

[//]: # (.cssg-snippet-transfer-upload-resume)
```js
var taskId = 'xxxxx';                   /* Required */
cos.restartTask(taskId);
```

**Parameter description**

| Parameter | Description | Type | Required |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ---- |
| taskId | ID of the upload task. When `putObject` is called, the `taskId` will be returned through the `TaskReady`callback. | String | Yes |
