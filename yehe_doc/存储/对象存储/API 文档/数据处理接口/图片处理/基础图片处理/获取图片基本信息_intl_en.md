## Overview
COS uses the **imageInfo** API provided by CI to query an imageâ€™s basic information, such as its format, width, and height. The input image cannot be larger than 32 MB, with its width and height not exceeding 30,000 pixels, and the total number of pixels not exceeding 250 million. The width and height of the output image cannot exceed 9,999 pixels. For an input animated image, the total number of pixels (Width x Height x Number of frames) cannot exceed 250 million pixels.

>! Image Processing is charged by CI. For detailed pricing, please see **Basic image processing fee** in [Billing and Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33431).
