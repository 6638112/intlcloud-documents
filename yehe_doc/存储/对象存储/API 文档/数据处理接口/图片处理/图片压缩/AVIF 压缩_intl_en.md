## Overview

Image compression refers to reducing an image’s size as much as possible without changing its quality, to reduce its cost for storage and traffic and speed up access.

COS launched the AVIF compression feature based on [CI](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33422) to convert images into AVIF format, which is a brand-new image format that uses AV1 compression algorithms. It was first introduced by Netflix in February 2020 and has supported browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.

## Restrictions

- Format: Images in JPG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WebP, TPG, HEIF, or other formats can be converted into AVIF.
- Size: The input image cannot be larger than 32 MB, with its width and height not exceeding 30,000 pixels, and the total number of pixels not exceeding 250 million. The width and height of the output image cannot exceed 9,999 pixels. For an input animated image, the total number of pixels (Width x Height x Number of frames) cannot exceed 250 million pixels.
- Number of frames (for animated images): For GIF, the number of frames cannot exceed 300.


## Prerequisites

- To use AVIF compression, enable the image advanced compression feature for your bucket on the bucket’s configuration page. For more information, please see [Setting Image Advanced Compression](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/40117).

## How to Use

COS uses the **imageMogr2** API of CI to provide AVIF compression service.

An image can be processed:

- Upon download
- Upon upload
- In cloud

>? AVIF compression is billed at image advanced compression rates by CI. For detailed pricing, please see the image processing prices of CI.

## API Format

#### 1. Processing upon download

```plaintext
download_url?imageMogr2/format/avif
```

#### 2. Processing upon upload

```http
PUT /<ObjectKey> HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
"is_pic_info": 1,
"rules": [{
    "fileid": "exampleobject",
    "rule": "imageMogr2/format/avif"
}]
}
```

#### 3. Processing in-cloud data

```http
POST /<ObjectKey>?image_process HTTP/1.1
Host: <BucketName-APPID>.cos.<Region>.myqcloud.com
Date: GMT Date
Content-length: Size
Authorization: Auth String
Pic-Operations: 
{
"is_pic_info": 1,
"rules": [{
    "fileid": "exampleobject",
    "rule": "imageMogr2/format/avif"
}]
}
```

>? **Processing upon download** is used as an example here, which does not store the output image in a bucket. If you need to store the output image, use **Processing upon upload** or **Processing in-cloud data** instead.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| download_url | URL of the input image, formatted as `&lt;BucketName-APPID>.cos.&lt;Region>.myqcloud.com/&lt;picture name>`<br>Example: `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg` |
| /format/&lt;Format> | Compression format, which is `avif`    |

## Examples

Assume that the input image is a 1,335.2 KB image in PNG format, as shown below:
![img](https://example-1258125638.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.png)

You can convert the image into AVIF format using the following URL:

```plaintext
http://example-1258125638.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/sample.png?imageMogr2/format/avif
```

**Compression ratio comparison**

| Format | Image Size |
| :---------- | :-------------------- |
| PNG (input image) | 1,335.2 KB |
| AVIF | 62.8 KB (compression ratio: 95.3%) |
