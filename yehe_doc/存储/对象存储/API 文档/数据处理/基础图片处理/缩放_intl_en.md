| Parameter                         | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| download_url | URL that is used to access a file. Format: `<BucketName-APPID>.cos.<picture region>.<domain>.com/<picture name>`, <br>for example, `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg`. |
| /thumbnail/!&lt;Scale>p | Specifies that the width and height of an image is Scale% of the original image. |
| /thumbnail/!&lt;Scale>px | Specifies that the width of an image is Scale% of the original image while the height keeps unchanged. |
| /thumbnail/!x&lt;Scale>p | Specifies that the height of the an image is Scale% of the original image while the width keeps unchanged. |
| /thumbnail/&lt;Width>x | Specifies the target image width, with the height proportionally scaled down. |
| /thumbnail/x&lt;Height> | Specifies the target image height, with the width proportionally scaled down. |
| /thumbnail/&lt;Width>x&lt;Height> | Specifies the maximum width and height of a thumbnail for proportional scaling |
| /thumbnail/!&lt;Width>x&lt;Height>r | Specifies the minimum width and height of a thumbnail for proportional scaling |
| /thumbnail/&lt;Width>x&lt;Height> | Forces image scaling with the specified Width and Height, which may cause deformation of the target image |
| /thumbnail/&lt;Area>@ | Proportionally scales an image so that its total pixels does not exceed the value of `Area` |
