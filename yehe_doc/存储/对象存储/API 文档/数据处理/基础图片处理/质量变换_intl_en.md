## Parameter Description

Operation name: quality.

| Parameter                         | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| download_url | URL that is used to access a file. Format: `<BucketName-APPID>.cos.<picture region>.<domain>.com/<picture name>`, <br>for example, `examplebucket-1250000000.cos.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com/picture.jpeg`. |
| /quality/&lt;Quality>  | Absolute image quality. Value range: 0 - 100; Use the value of original image quality (default) or specified quality, whichever is smaller. If &lt;Quality&gt; is followed by an English exclamation mark (!), a specified value must be used, e.g., `90!`. |
| /rquality/&lt;quality> | Indicates the relative image quality. Value range: 0 - 100. The value is subject to the original image quality. For example, assume that the original image quality is 80. If you set `rquality` to 80, the resulting image quality is 64 (80 x 80%). |
| /lquality/&lt;quality> | Indicates the lowest image quality. Value range: 0 - 100. This value is the quality threshold for the resulting image. <br>For example, assume that the original image quality is 85. If you set `lquality` to 80, the resulting image quality is 85.<br>Assume that the original image quality is 60. If you set `lquality` to 80, the resulting image quality is improved to 80. |
