## Feature
Exchangeable Image File (EXIF) records the shooting parameters, thumbnails, and other attributes of digital pictures. COS can obtain EXIF data on images by using the **exif** API in Tencent Cloud CI. Currently, supported images are smaller than 20 MB in size and smaller than 9,999 pixels in length and width.

>-Image processing is a paid service, the fees of which are charged by Cloud Infinite. For detailed billing instructions, see Cloud Infiniteâ€™s [Billing and Pricing] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33431).
>- If an image has no EXIF data, `{"error" : "no exif data"}` will be returned.
