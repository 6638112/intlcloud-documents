## Symptoms

When I access a custom origin server domain over HTTPS, an error is reported.


## Possible Causes

The certificate configuration is incorrect or the custom origin server domain is not configured.

## Troubleshooting Procedure

### Using a CDN certificate

1. Log in to the [CDN console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Domain Management**.
3. Click the name of the domain to configure. Then, select the **HTTPS Configuration** tab.
4. In the **HTTPS Configuration** area, click **Configure Now**.
For more information, please see [HTTPS Configuration Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/35213).
5. Wait for about 5 minutes. When the CDN domain is deployed again, you can use HTTPS.


### Using a COS certificate 

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. Click **Bucket List** in the left sidebar.
3. Click the name of the desired bucket to go to the configuration page.
4. Click **Domains and Transfer** > **Custom Endpoint**.

5. Select the desired domain and click **Bind Certificate** to configure the certificate.

>!Currently, certificate binding supports only the Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Hong Kong (China) regions. Binding wildcard certificates is not supported.
>
6. Click **Confirm**.

When the value of **HTTPS certificate** is **Uploaded**, you can use HTTPS.
