## Troubleshooting

### Message: “Access Denied.”

If the following message is displayed when you access COS:
```
<Code>AccessDenied</Code>
<Message>Access Denied.</Message>
```

You can:

1. Log in to the [COS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
2. Click **Bucket List** in the left sidebar.
3. Click the name of the desired bucket to go to the configuration page.
4. Click **Permission Management** > **Bucket ACL (Access Control List)**.
5. In the **Bucket ACL (Access Control List)** area, check whether the COS account is granted access permission.
 - If yes, proceed with the next step.
 - If not, click **Add User** and grant the account the permission needed.

6. Verify whether the account has the granted permission.
 - If yes, proceed with the next step.
 - If not, click **Edit** to configure again.
7. In the **Permission Policy Settings** area, check whether a policy has been configured for the account.
>! 
>- If the bucket is set to **Private Read/Write** but anonymous access is set in the policy, the permission set in the policy takes effect.
>- If an action is set to **Allow** and **Deny** in different policies associated with the same sub-account, the action will be denied.
>- Policies set for **Everyone** have lower priorities than those set for a **Specified user**.
>
 - If yes, proceed with the next step.
 - If not, click **Add Policy** and add the needed permission to the sub-account that initiates the signed request.

8. Verify whether the account has the granted permission.
 - If yes, proceed with the next step.
 - If not, click **Edit** to configure again.
9. Check whether the value of `q-ak` (case-sensitive) is the `secretID` and `secretKey` of the root account.
 - If yes, proceed with the next step.
 - If not, change the value of `q-ak` to the `secretID` and `secretKey` of the root account.
10. Check whether the resource is accessed by a cross-account.
 - If yes, authorize the sub-account by referring to [Authorizing Cross-Account’s Sub-account Read/Write Access to Specified File](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/11092).
 - If not, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support).
