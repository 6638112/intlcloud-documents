Billable items in COS include [storage usage](#jf1), [requests](#jf2), [data retrievals](#jf3), [traffic](#jf4), and [management features](#jf5). The following describes each billable item in detail.


> ?COS offers the following object storage classes for different access frequencies and disaster recovery levels: STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. For more information, see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

## Pricing

After you learn about COS billable items and [Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239), you may be able to estimate your COS fees on your own.

## Storage Usage Fees

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage usage |STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE | Storage usage is the actual storage space consumed by your data. It is billed based on the size of the storage capacity you actually use.  |<li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>Storage usage fees = storage usage unit price * monthly storage usage<br><li>Monthly storage usage = sum of "daily storage usage" in the month / number of days in the month<br><li>Daily storage usage = sum of "5-minute storage usage" / 288 (number of statistical points) |



#### Billing restrictions

1. STANDARD_IA storage class: if the storage duration is less than 30 days, it will be calculated as 30 days. If a single stored file is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
2. ARCHIVE storage class: this storage class is available in Public Cloud regions only. If the storage duration is less than 90 days, it will be calculated as 90 days. If a single stored file is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
3. DEEP ARCHIVE storage class: this storage class is available only in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu regions. If the storage duration is less than 180 days, it will be calculated as 180 days. If a single stored file is less than 64 KB, it will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
4. If you successfully uploaded an object in STANDARD_IA or ARCHIVE storage class without enabling versioning, COS will delete the existing object of the **same name** (if any), and in this case, storage fees will still incur for **earlier deletion of the object**.

## Request Fees

Request fees include the fees incurred by **user requests** and **backend requests** generated by feature configuration.

- User requests: you can perform upload, download, query, delete and other operations via APIs, SDKs or the console by sending requests to Tencent COS.
- Backend requests: these include requests to transition objects, delete expired STANDARD copies restored from ARCHIVE, read/write data for cross-region replication, and deliver inventory reports.

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
|Number of requests  | STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE  | Calculated based on the number of requests sent  |  <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>If the accumulated number of requests is below 10,000, it will be calculated as 10,000 requests<br><li>Request fees = unit price per 10,000 requests * monthly accumulated number of requests / 10,000 |

#### Billing restrictions

1. Both successful and failed requests are billable.
2. 10,000 requests serve as the smallest counting unit for request fees; therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is below 10,000 it will be calculated as 10,000 requests, no matter whether a request succeeds or fails.
3. Data cannot be read or downloaded in the ARCHIVE and DEEP ARCHIVE storage classes. You will be billed for objects restored from ARCHIVE to STANDARD at STANDARD rates, and for objects restored from DEEP ARCHIVE at DEEP ARCHIVE rates.
4. You may also be billed by the number of your requests to retrieve data from DEEP ARCHIVE.

   </tr>
</table>


#### Billing restrictions

**STANDARD_IA**, **ARCHIVE** and **DEEP ARCHIVE** storage classes are designed to store cold data. To read or download data from STANDARD_IA, COS needs to retrieve it backend first. Data in ARCHIVE cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored (unfrozen) to STANDARD storage class.

## Traffic Fees

Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by storage data reads.

   </tr> 
</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. ARCHIVE storage class data cannot be read or downloaded. The data must first be restored to STANDARD storage class and read there. Therefore, traffic from these requests are counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. **Public network downstream traffic** is generated when the COS origin server returns data to a third-party CDN node during origin-pull.
3. Tencent Cloud CDN origin-pull traffic is generated by browsing or downloading COS data on the client through **a Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration domain name** after CDN acceleration is enabled.
4. Public network downstream traffic is generated by downloading objects through **object links** and browsing objects through **static website access node**. 
5. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees vary, depending on the region where the source bucket resides.

> ?Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [COS Access via Private Network and Public Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613).


#### Traffic trends

The figure below shows the traffic fees incurred by data transmitted from COS to an end user with Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration domain name enabled and disabled, respectively.
