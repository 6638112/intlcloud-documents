Billable items in COS include [storage usage](#jf1), [requests](#jf2), [data retrievals](#jf3), [traffic](#jf4), and [management features](#jf5). The following describes each billable item in detail.


> ?COS offers the following object storage classes for different access frequencies and disaster recovery needs: STANDARD, STANDARD_IA, ARCHIVE, and DEEP ARCHIVE. For more information, please see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30925).

## Storage Usage Fees

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Storage usage |STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE | Storage usage is the actual storage space consumed by your data. It is billed based on the actual size of the storage capacity used. |<li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>Storage usage fees = Storage usage unit price x Monthly storage usage<br><li>Monthly storage usage = Sum of "daily storage usage" in the month/Number of days in the month<br><li>Daily storage usage = Sum of "5-minute storage usage"/288 (number of statistical points) |



#### Billing restrictions

1. STANDARD_IA storage class: a storage duration less than 30 days will be calculated as 30 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
2. ARCHIVE storage class: available in public cloud regions only. A storage duration less than 90 days will be calculated as 90 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
3. DEEP ARCHIVE storage class: available only in Beijing, Guangzhou, and Chengdu regions. A storage duration less than 180 days will be calculated as 180 days. A single stored file less than 64 KB will be calculated as 64 KB; otherwise, files are calculated based on their actual size.
4. If you upload an object with the **same name** in STANDARD_IA or ARCHIVE storage class without enabling versioning, COS will delete the existing object of the **same name** (if any). In this case, storage fees will still incur for **earlier deletion of the object**.

## Request Fees

Request fees include the fees incurred by **user requests** and **backend requests** generated by feature configuration.

- User requests: you can perform upload, download, query, delete and other operations via APIs, SDKs or the console by sending requests to Tencent COS.
- Backend requests: these include requests to transition objects, delete expired STANDARD copies restored from ARCHIVE, read/write data for cross-region replication, and deliver inventory reports.

| Billable Item   | Applicable Storage Class&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                               | Definition                                                   | Billing Description                                                     |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Number of requests  | STANDARD<br>STANDARD_IA<br>ARCHIVE<br>DEEP ARCHIVE  | Calculated based on the number of requests sent  |  <li>Monthly billing cycle<br><li>Even if the accumulated number of requests is below 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests<br><li>Request fees = Unit price per 10,000 requests x Monthly accumulated number of requests/10,000 |

#### Billing restrictions

1. Both successful and failed requests are billable.
2. When calculating request fees, the minimum counting unit for the number of requests is 10,000. Therefore, even if the monthly accumulated requests is less than 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests, regardless of request success or failure.
3. Data cannot be read or downloaded in the ARCHIVE and DEEP ARCHIVE storage classes. You will be billed for objects restored from ARCHIVE to STANDARD at STANDARD rates, and for objects restored from DEEP ARCHIVE at DEEP ARCHIVE rates.
4. You may also be billed by the number of your requests to retrieve data from DEEP ARCHIVE.

#### Billing restrictions

Storage classes suitable for cold data includes**STANDARD_IA**, **ARCHIVE** and **DEEP ARCHIVE** . To read or download data from STANDARD_IA, COS needs to retrieve it first. Data in ARCHIVE cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored (unfrozen) to STANDARD storage class.

## Traffic Fees

Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by storage data reads.

   </tr> 
</table>

#### Billing restrictions

1. ARCHIVE storage class data cannot be read or downloaded. The data must first be restored to STANDARD storage class to be readable. Therefore, traffic from these requests is counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. **Public network downstream traffic** is generated when the COS origin server returns data to a third-party CDN node during origin-pull.
3. After CDN acceleration is enabled, Tencent Cloud CDN origin-pull traffic is generated when a user browses or downloads COS data on the client through **a Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration domain name**.
4. Public network downstream traffic is generated when a user downloads objects through **object links** and browses objects through **static website access node**. 
5. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees vary, depending on the region where the source bucket resides.

> ?Tencent Cloud products within the same region access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [COS Access via Private Network and Public Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613#cos-access-via-private-network-and-public-network).


#### Traffic trends

The figure below shows the traffic fees incurred by data transmitted from COS to an end user with Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration domain name enabled and disabled, respectively.
