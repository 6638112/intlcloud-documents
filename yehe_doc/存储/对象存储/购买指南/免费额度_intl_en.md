## Access and Query
You receive the benefits of COS free tier in the format of storage pack automatically after you sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) and activate COS service in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5). 


## Validity Period

The **Free Tier** is valid for 6 months after the activation of your COS service.

For example, if you activated COS at 17:13:14 on March 10, 2019, and assume that 6 months is equal to 180 days, then the free tier would cover your STANDARD storage usage between March 10 and September 5, 2019.


## Billing Sequence

During the free tier term, you may be charged other fees you incur, such as request, traffic and other basic fees. Therefore, the billing sequence varies for your billing settlement depending on the scenario.

- By default, COS bills are settled in a pay-as-you-go manner.
- If you are eligible for the free tier for STANDARD storage usage, and have no storage pack available, you are charged in a pay-as-you-go manner only for the usage exceeding the free tier.


## Example

John Smith, a personal user, activated the COS service on March 10, 2019. He uploaded files of 60 GB in standard storage class on March 16, downloaded 10 GB of data through the public network on March 20, and didn't perform any other operations at other times, so:

- He was granted free STANDARD storage usage of 50 GB per month for 6 months.
- On March 21, 2019, the public network downstream traffic was billed for 10 GB of data.
- On April 1, 2019, the STANDARD storage usage was billed, and 10 GB of storage usage in excess of the free tier was used every day from March 16 to March 31 (160 GB in total for 16 days). This value was divided by 31, and the result of 5.16 GB was billed as the STANDARD storage usage.
- At the beginning of April 2019, the data uploading and downloading requests in March were billed.

In April 2019, John didn't perform any other operations, and the 60 GB of data was retained in COS, so:

- At the beginning of May 2019, the standard storage capacity was billed. The monthly storage capacity was 60 GB, which exceeded the free tier, **so fees for the excessive 10 GB of standard storage capacity were charged**.


>The above example applies to scenarios where a personal user has activated the COS service for the first time, and is eligible for the free tier. For billing after the free tier term ends, see [Billing Examples](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6241).
