Traffic is the accumulated value of data traffic generated when you use and access COS, including public network upstream traffic, public network downstream traffic, private network upstream traffic, private network downstream traffic, and CDN origin-pull traffic. COS charges you by the accumulated traffic usage.

> ?If the global acceleration domain name is used to download data, **global acceleration downstream traffic fees** and **public network downstream traffic fees** will be incurred. If the global acceleration domain name is used as the CDN origin domain name for origin-pull, **global acceleration downstream traffic fees** and **CDN origin-pull traffic fees** will be incurred.

## Billing Restrictions

1. ARCHIVED data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored to the STANDARD storage class. Therefore, traffic generated from these requests is counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. Public network downstream traffic is generated when the data is returned to COS through origin-pull by using a third-party CDN service.
3. Public network downstream traffic is generated when a user downloads objects through **object links** or browses objects through a **static website endpoint**. 
4. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees will vary by source bucket region.
5. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, traffic fees are subject to those of the storage class after object movement.


## Traffic Generated by Using COS as CDN Origin

After you enable the CDN acceleration domain name, data downloads and access through it will incur fees:

| Billable Item | Description |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CDN origin-pull traffic | Origin-pull traffic generated by data transfer from COS to the CDN edge node when COS is used as the CDN origin. |
| CDN traffic | CDN outbound traffic generated by data download from the CDN edge node to the local system or client when COS is used as a CDN origin. |
| COS request | COS requests generated by data transfer from COS to the CDN edge node when COS is used as the CDN origin. Request fees are billed by the number of requests sent to COS. |


>?CDN traffic fees are charged by CDN. For detailed pricing, see [Pricing | Content Delivery Network](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cdn).

## Traffic Pricing

For the unit prices of traffic, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos).
## Billing Examples

>?
> - Prices in the example below are for reference only. For the actual prices, see [Pricing | Cloud Object Storage](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos).
> - The minimum number of requests for billing is 10,000. Therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is less than 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests, regardless of whether the request succeeds or fails.

### Example: STANDARD storage usage fees + STANDARD request fees + public network downstream traffic fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded a 10 GB object to a bucket residing in Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class, generating 100 requests. On November 2 and November 3, user A downloaded the object to the local file system over the public network with CDN disabled. Apart from these operations, user A did not perform any other operations in November. As storage usage fees and request fees are calculated on a monthly basis, they will be billed on December 1, 2020. Traffic fees are calculated on a daily basis and will thus be billed on November 3 and November 4, 2020. The fees are calculated as follows:

 -  STANDARD storage usage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month * 10 GB = 0.24 USD
 - STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests * 10,000 requests = 0.02 USD
 - Public network downstream traffic fees = 0.1 USD/GB * 10 GB * 2 = 2 USD


In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.02 + 2 = 2.26 USD.
