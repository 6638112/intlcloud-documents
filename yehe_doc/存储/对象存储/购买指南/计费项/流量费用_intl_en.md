Traffic fees are calculated based on the accumulated traffic generated by downloading the data stored.

> ?Tencent Cloud products within the same region will access each other over the private network by default and no traffic fees will be incurred. For more information on how to identify private network access, please see [COS Access via the Private Network and the Public Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30613#cos-access-via-private-network-and-public-network).

## Billing Restrictions

1. ARCHIVED data cannot be read or downloaded until it is restored to the STANDARD storage class. Therefore, traffic generated from these requests is counted in the STANDARD storage class.
2. Public network downstream traffic is generated when the data is returned to COS through origin-pull using a third-party CDN service.
3. After CDN acceleration is enabled, CDN origin-pull traffic is generated when a user browses or downloads COS data on the client through **a Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration endpoint**.
4. Public network downstream traffic is generated when a user downloads objects through **object links** or browses objects through a **static website endpoint**. 
5. Cross-region replication traffic is generated when you replicate data from a bucket in one region to a bucket in another region using APIs or the cross-region replication feature. The traffic fees will vary depending on the region where the source bucket resides.
6. For INTELLIGENT TIERING, traffic fees are subject to those of the storage class after object movement.


## Traffic Direction

The figure below shows the traffic fees incurred by data transmitted from COS to an end user with the Tencent Cloud CDN acceleration endpoint enabled and disabled, respectively.

>?CDN traffic fees are charged by Tencent Cloud CDN. For detailed pricing, please see [CDN Pricing](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cdn).

## Billing Example

>?
> - Prices in the example below are for reference only. For the actual prices, please see [COS Pricing](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos).
> - The minimum number of requests for billing is 10,000. Therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is less than 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests, regardless of whether the request succeeds or fails.

### Example: STANDARD storage fees + STANDARD request fees + Public downstream traffic fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded a 10 GB object to a bucket residing in the Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class, generating 100 requests. On November 2 and November 3, user A downloaded the object to the local file system over a public network with CDN disabled. Apart from these operations, user A did not perform any other operations in November. As storage fees and request fees are calculated on a monthly basis, they will be billed on December 1, 2020. Traffic fees are calculated on a daily basis and will thus be billed on November 3 and November 4, 2020. The fees are calculated as follows:

 - STANDARD storage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month x 10 GB = 0.24 USD
 - STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests x 10,000 requests = 0.02 USD
 - Public downstream traffic fees = 0.1 USD/GB x 10 GB x 2 = 2 USD


In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.02 + 2 = 2.26 USD.
