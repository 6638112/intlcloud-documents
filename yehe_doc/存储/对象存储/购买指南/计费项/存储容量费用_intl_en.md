Storage usage refers to the storage used. The rate you are charged depends on the objectsâ€² size and how long you stored them. For different storage classes, the unit price, minimum object size, and minimum storage duration period are different, which will be described below. The actual costs depend on the use case and storage class of the object.

## Billing Examples

>?
>- Prices in the examples below are for reference only. For the actual prices, please see [COS Pricing](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/cos).
>- The storage capacity is calculated in binary. For example, 1 TB = 1,024 GB.
>- The minimum number of billable requests is 10,000. Therefore, if the number of monthly accumulated requests is less than 10,000, you will still be billed for 10,000 requests, regardless of whether the request succeeds or fails.

### Example 1: STANDARD storage usage fees + STANDARD request fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user A uploaded 10 GB of data to a bucket residing in the Guangzhou region in the STANDARD storage class, generating 100 requests. Apart from this, user A did not perform any other operations in November. As storage usage fees and request fees are calculated and billed on the 1st in the next month, the storage usage and request fees will be calculated and billed on December 1, 2020, as follows:

- Pay-as-you-go:
 - STANDARD storage usage fees = 0.024 USD/GB/month x 10 GB = 0.24 USD
 - STANDARD request fees = 0.002 USD/10,000 requests x 10,000 requests = 0.02 USD

In summary, the total bill for user A in November is calculated as follows: 0.24 + 0.02 = 0.26 USD.


### Example 2: STANDARD_IA storage usage fees + STANDARD_IA request fees

Assume that on November 1, 2020, user B uploaded 10 GB of data (i.e. 10,000 pieces of 34 KB objects) to a bucket residing in the Guangzhou region in the STANDARD_IA storage class, generating 100 requests. Apart from this, user B did not perform any other operations in November. As storage usage fees and request fees are calculated on the 1st in the next month, the storage usage fees and request fees will be calculated and billed on December 1, 2020 as follows:

- Pay-as-you-go:
   - STANDARD_IA storage usage = 10 GB + 10,000 x 30 KB = 10.286 GB
   - STANDARD_IA storage usage fees = 0.018 USD/GB/month x 10.286 GB = 0.19 USD
   - STANDARD_IA request fees = 0.01 USD/10,000 requests x 10,000 requests = 0.01 USD


In summary, the total bill for user B in November is calculated as follows: 00.19 + 0.01 = 0.2 USD.
