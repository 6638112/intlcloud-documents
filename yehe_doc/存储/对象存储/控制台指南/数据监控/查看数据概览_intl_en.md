## Overview

The COS console features a Dashboard where you can have an overview of your storage data, including the number of buckets, number of objects, storage usage, request counts, and traffic.

> - To view the above data using a sub-account, you need to have the **bucket list access** permission. For more information, see “Adding a Preset Policy” in [Accessing Bucket List Using Sub-Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/17061).
> - Only **Number of Buckets** is a real-time metric on this dashboard, while the other metrics are delayed by approximately 2 hours. All of these metrics are for monitoring purposes only. For detailed billing data, please go to the [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account).
