## Overview

MySQL Backup is a [SCF](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583)-based feature provided by COS. It allows you to store data in TencentDB for MySQL to COS so that data can be stored persistently and stay safe from data loss or corruption. After you set a backup function rule for a bucket, SCF will scan your MySQL backup files periodically and store them in the bucket.

## Notes

- MySQL Backup functions only back up the backup files of TencentDB for MySQL. Therefore, if MySQL backup has not been enabled, the functions cannot be executed. For more information about TencentDB for MySQL backups, please see [Backing up TencentDB for MySQL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/37796).
- If you have added a MySQL backup rule to your bucket via the COS console, the backup function will appear in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list?rid=1&ns=default). **DO NOT** delete the function. Otherwise, your rule may not take effect.
- Regions where SCF is available support MySQL Backup, including Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hong Kong (China), Singapore, Mumbai, Toronto, and Silicon Valley, and more. For more supported regions, please see [SCF Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583).
