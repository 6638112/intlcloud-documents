## Overview

The object tagging feature is designed to help you group and manage objects in your bucket. You can add key-value pairs for your object as its identifier. An object tag is made up of a `tagKey`, `=`, and `tagValue` (for example, `group = IT`). You can set, query, and delete tags for a specified object.

>! Object tagging is a billable service. For detailed pricing, please see [Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/cos).

Keep the following restrictions in mind when you use object tagging:

- You can add up to 10 different tags for one object.
- A tag key cannot start with `qcs:`, `project`, or any other system reserved characters.
- Tag keys and tag values are case-sensitive. Both of them can be 1-127 UTF-8 characters in length, containing letters, spaces, digits, and special characters `+, -, =, ., _, :, /, @`.

For more restrictions, please see [Object Tagging Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/35665).
