## Introduction

In the COS Console, you can view the details about folders, including the number and size of objects in them. This document describes how to view folder details.

>
>- COS stores objects in a flat structure with no traditional folder concept. To make COS easy to use, we use objects whose object keys are suffixed with `/` as folders, but actually a "folder" in COS is an object occupying 0 KB.
>- If you want to query the number and size of all folders in the current bucket, you can get an inventory report with the inventory feature. For more information, please see [Inventory Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30622)ã€‚

> Nested folders inside a folder are counted as objects.
> Example 1. If a folder contains 1 empty folder and 5 objects, then the total number of objects in the folder will be 6.
> Example 2. If a folder contains 1 folder (containing 2 objects) and 5 objects, then the total number of objects in the folder will be 8.
