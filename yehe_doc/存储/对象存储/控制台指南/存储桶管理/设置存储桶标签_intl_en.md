## Overview

A bucket tag is a key-value pair (key = value), where the tag key and tag value are connected by an equal sign (=), for example, group = IT. It can be used to identify a bucket, helping you achieve group management of buckets. You can set, query, and delete the tag for a specified bucket via the console.


>!
>- Each bucket can have up to 50 different bucket tags.
>- `qcs:` and `project` are reserved fields. Therefore, do not use them in tag keys or tag values. For more limits, please see [Bucket Tag Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31509).
