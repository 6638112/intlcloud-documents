>!When granting access permissions to a sub-user or collaborator, please be sure to grant the minimum set of API access permissions needed to satisfy your business needs. There may be data security risks associated with granting excessive access to all of your resources `(resource:*)` or all operations `(action:*)`.


## Overview
When using a temporary key to access COS, the operation permissions required vary depending on the API or series of APIs that you specify.

A COS API access policy is a JSON string. For example, below is a policy that grants the permission to perform uploads (including simple upload, upload using an HTML form, and multipart upload) for objects prefixed with `doc` and downloads for objects prefixed with `doc2` for the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region "ap-beijing" under the APPID `1250000000`:
```shell
{
	"version": "2.0",
	"statement": [{
			"action": [
				// Upload an object using simple upload 
				"name/cos:PutObject",
				// Upload an object using an HTML form 
				"name/cos:PostObject",
				// Initialize a multipart upload operation 
				"name/cos:InitiateMultipartUpload",
				// List all in-progress multipart upload operations
				"name/cos:ListMultipartUploads",
				// List uploaded parts 
				"name/cos:ListParts",
				// Upload parts 
				"name/cos:UploadPart",
				// Complete a multipart upload operation 
				"name/cos:CompleteMultipartUpload",
				// Abort a multipart upload operation 
				"name/cos:AbortMultipartUpload"
			],
			"effect": "allow",
			"resource": [
				"qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
			]
		},
		{
			"action": [
				// Download 
				"name/cos:GetObject"
			],
			"effect": "allow",
			"resource": [
				"qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc2/*"
			]
		}
	]
}
```

#### Access policy elements

| Name | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| version | The policy syntax version. The default is 2.0. |
| effect | Allow or deny |
| resource | Specific data authorized to be operated on. It can be any resource, a resource in a path with a specified prefix, a resource in a specified absolute path, or a combination thereof. |
| action | COS API. You can specify one, several, or all (`*`) COS APIs as needed, e.g. `name/cos:GetService`. **Note that this value is case-sensitive**.       |
| condition | Condition (this value is optional). For more information, see [Condition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10603#6.-condition) |

Examples of access policy settings for each COS API are listed below.

## Service APIs

### Querying a bucket list

To grant permission to access this API, the `action` field in the policy should be set to `name/cos:GetService`, and the `resource` field should be set to `*`.

#### Sample 

The following policy grants the permission to query a bucket list:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:GetService"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Bucket APIs

The `resource` field for bucket API access policies is outlined in further detail below:

- To allow access to buckets in all regions
the `resource` field should be set to `*`. **Please use this option with caution as it may present data security risks due to excessive permissions**.

- To only allow access to buckets in a specified region, the `resource` field should be configured as shown in the following example:
For example, to grant access to `examplebucket-1250000000` under the APPID `1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing`, the `resource` field should be `qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/*`.

- To only allow access to a bucket with a specified name in a specified region, the `resource` field should be configured as shown in the following example:
- For example, to grant access to the bucket named `examplebucket-1250000000` under the APPID `1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing`, the `resource` field should be `qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/`.

The `action` field for bucket API policies varies by operation. The following section lists several bucket API access policies for your reference.

### Creating a bucket

The following policy grants the permission to query the ACL only for objects with the path prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID ·1250000000·:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:GetObjectACL"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuring a pre-flight request for cross-origin access

To grant permission to access this API, the `action` field in the policy should be set to `name/cos:OptionsObject`.

#### Sample 

The following policy grants the permission to send an OPTIONS request only for objects with the path prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:OptionsObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Restoring an archived object

To grant permission to access this API, the `action` field in the policy should be set to `name/cos:PostObjectRestore`.

#### Sample 

The following policy grants the permission to restore an archived object only with the path prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:PostObjectRestore"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deleting a single object

To grant permission to access this API, the `action` field in the policy should be set to `name/cos:DeleteObject`.

#### Sample 

The following policy grants the permission to delete only the object `audio.mp3` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/audio.mp3"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Deleting multiple objects

To grant permission to access this API, the `action` field in the policy should be set to `name/cos:DeleteObject`.

#### Sample 

The following policy grants the permission to batch delete only the objects `audio.mp3` and `video.mp4` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` in the region `ap-beijing` under the APPID `1250000000`:

```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/audio.mp3",
        "qcs::cos:ap-beijing:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/video.mp4"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Common Scenarios

### Granting full read-write permission for all resources
The following policy grants full read-write permission for all resources:
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "*"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Granting read-only permission for all resources
The following policy grants read-only permission for all resources:
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "name/cos:HeadObject",
        "name/cos:GetObject",
        "name/cos:ListObject",
        "name/cos:OptionsObject"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Granting read-write permission for any resource under a specified path with a specified prefix
The following policy grants the permission to access only files under the path with prefix `doc` in the bucket `examplebucket-1250000000` and does not allow any operations on files in other paths:
```shell
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "*"
      ],
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": [
        "qcs::cos:ap-shanghai:uid/1250000000:examplebucket-1250000000/doc/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
