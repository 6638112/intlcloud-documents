## Overview

CLS can be connected to Grafana to export the raw log data and SQL aggregate analysis results for display in Grafana. To display the results in Grafana, you only need to install the Grafana plugins for CLS and enter search and analysis statements in Grafana.

You can log in to [Grafana](http://106.53.153.13:3000/d/r6mrhEbGz/cls-demo) by using the following username and password for trial.
- Username: Viewer
- Password: clsdemo

This document describes how to install and configure Grafana on CentOS.

## Directions

### Installing Grafana

For more information on how to install Grafana, please see [Install Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/).
The following uses installing Grafana 7.3.6 on CentOS as an example:
```
sudo yum install initscripts urw-fonts wget
wget https://dl.grafana.com/oss/release/grafana-7.3.6-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum install grafana-7.3.6-1.x86_64.rpm
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl status grafana-server 
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server  
```
To install more visual panels (such as pie and graph panels), please install Grafana panel plugins by running the corresponding commands.
For example, if you want to install the pie panel, you can run the following command:
```
grafana-cli plugins install grafana-piechart-panel
service grafana-server restart
```
For information on more plugins, please see [Grafana Plugins](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins?type=panel).

### Installing and configuring Grafana plugins for CLS

1. Install Grafana plugins for CLS in the `/var/lib/grafana/plugins/` plugin directory.
```
cd /var/lib/grafana/plugins/
wget https://github.com/TencentCloud/cls-grafana-datasource/releases/latest/download/cls-grafana-datasource.zip
unzip cls-grafana-datasource.zip
```
>? 
> - If your CVM instance is not on CentOS, please confirm the location of the Grafana plugin directory first and go to the directory for installation.
> - You need to install Grafana 7.0 or above. If your Grafana version is lower than 7.0, configuration backup and upgrade are required. For details, see [Upgrade Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/upgrading/).
> 
2. Open the `grafana.ini` configuration file on the server where Grafana has been deployed.
 - The file path on macOS is `/usr/local/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`.
 - The file path on Linux is `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`.
3. Set the `allow_loading_unsigned_plugins` parameter in **plugins**.
```
allow_loading_unsigned_plugins = tencent-cls-grafana-datasource
```
4. Run the following command to restart the Grafana service:
```
   service grafana-server restart
```
