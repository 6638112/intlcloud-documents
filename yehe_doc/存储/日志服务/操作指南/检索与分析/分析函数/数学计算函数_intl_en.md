## Example

To compare the PV values of today and yesterday and express the result as a percentage, the query and analysis statement is as follows:
```
* | SELECT diff [1] AS today, round((diff [3] -1.0) * 100, 2) AS growth FROM (SELECT compare(pv, 86400) as diff FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as pv FROM log))
```
