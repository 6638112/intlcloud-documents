## Overview

A JSON log automatically extracts the key at the first layer as the field name and the value at the first layer as the field value to implement structured processing of the entire log. Each complete log ends with a line break `\n`.

## Prerequisites

Suppose your raw JSON log data is:

```plaintext
{"remote_ip":"10.135.46.111","time_local":"22/Jan/2019:19:19:34 +0800","body_sent":23,"responsetime":0.232,"upstreamtime":"0.232","upstreamhost":"unix:/tmp/php-cgi.sock","http_host":"127.0.0.1","method":"POST","url":"/event/dispatch","request":"POST /event/dispatch HTTP/1.1","xff":"-","referer":"http://127.0.0.1/my/course/4","agent":"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0","response_code":"200"}
```

After being structured by CLS, the log will become:

```plaintext
agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0
body_sent: 23
http_host: 127.0.0.1
method: POST
referer: http://127.0.0.1/my/course/4
remote_ip: 10.135.46.111
request: POST /event/dispatch HTTP/1.1
response_code: 200
responsetime: 0.232
time_local: 22/Jan/2019:19:19:34 +0800
upstreamhost: unix:/tmp/php-cgi.sock
upstreamtime: 0.232
url: /event/dispatch
xff: -
```

## Directions

### Logging in to the console

1. Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Log Topic** to go to the log topic management page.

### Creating a log topic

1. Click **Create Log Topic**.
2. In the pop-up dialog box, enter `test-json` as **Log Topic Name** and click **OK**.

### Configuring LogListener collection

1. After the log topic is created successfully, go to the log topic management page.
2. Select the **Collection Configuration** tab and click the collection status switch to enter the collection configuration editing mode.
3. In the **LogListener Collection Configuration** item, click **Add Configuration** to enter the Agent configuration page.


### Configuring a log file collection path

The log file collection path is in the format of **[directory prefix expression]**/\*\*/**[file name expression]**. LogListener matches all paths with common prefixes that satisfy the **[directory prefix expression]**, and monitors all log files under these directories (including subdirectories) that satisfy the **[file name expression]**. The detailed parameter description is as follows:

| Field     | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Directory prefix | The directory prefix for log files, which supports only the wildcard characters `\*` and `?`. `\*` indicates that one or more characters can be matched, while `?` indicates that any single character can be matched. |
| /**/     | Current directory and all its subdirectories.                                  |
| File name   | A log file name supports only the wildcard characters `\*` and `?`. `\*` indicates that one or more characters can be matched, while `?` indicates that any single character can be matched. |

>? Common configuration modes are as follows:
> - [Common directory prefix]/\*\*/[common filename prefix]\*
> - [Common directory prefix]/\*\*/*[common filename suffix]
> - [Common directory prefix]/\*\*/[common filename prefix]\*[common filename suffix]
> - [Common directory prefix]/\*\*/\*[common string]\*

Samples:

| No. | Directory Prefix Expression | Filename Expression | Description                                                         |
| ---- | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1.   | /var/log/nginx | access.log   | In this example, the log path is configured as `/var/log/nginx/**/access.log`. LogListener will listen for log files named `access.log` in all subdirectories in the `/var/log/nginx` prefix path. |
| 2.   | /var/log/nginx | \*.log       | In this example, the log path is configured as `/var/log/nginx/**/*.log`. LogListener will listen for log files suffixed with `.log` in all subdirectories in the `/var/log/nginx` prefix path. |
| 3.   | /var/log/nginx | error\*      | In this example, the log path is configured as `/var/log/nginx/**/error*`. LogListener will listen for log files prefixed with `error` in all subdirectories in the `/var/log/nginx` prefix path. |




>!
> - Only LogListener 2.3.9 or above allows adding multiple collection paths.
> - The system does not support uploading logs with contents in multiple text formats, which may cause write failure, such as `key:"{"substream":XXX}"`.
> - Youâ€™re advised to configure the collection path as `log/*.log` and rename the old file after log rotation as `log/*.log.xxxx`.
> - By default, a log file can only be collected by one log topic. If you want to have multiple collection configurations for the same file, please add a soft link to the source file and add it to another collection configuration.

### Associating a machine group

Select the target machine group from the machine group list and associate it with the current log topic. Please note that the associated machine group must be in the same region as the log topic. For detailed directions, please see [Machine Group Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/17412).



### Selecting the JSON mode

1. Click **Next** to configure the log parsing mode.
2. Select **JSON** as **Extraction Mode**.


### Configuring the collection time

Time configuration is described as follows:
- Log time is measured in seconds.
- The time attribute of a log is defined in two ways: collection time and original timestamp.
- Collection time: the time attribute of a log is determined by the time when CLS collects the log.
- Original timestamp: the time attribute of a log is determined by the timestamp in the raw log.

#### Using the collection time as the time attribute of logs

Keep **Collection Time** enabled.

#### Using the original timestamp as the time attribute of logs

Disable **Collection Time** and enter the time key of the original timestamp and the corresponding time parsing format in **Time Key** and **Time Parsing Format** respectively. For more information on the time parsing format, please see [Configuring Time Format](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32942).


Below are examples of how to enter a time parsing format:
Example 1: the parsing format of the original timestamp `10/Dec/2017:08:00:00` is `%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S`.
Example 2: the parsing format of the original timestamp ``2017-12-10 08:00:00`` is `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`.
Example 3: the parsing format of the original timestamp `12/10/2017, 08:00:00` is `%m/%d/%Y, %H:%M:%S`.

>! Second can be used as the unit of log time. If the time is entered in a wrong format, the collection time is used as the log time.
>

### Filter rules

Filters are designed to help you extract valuable log data by adding log collection filter rules based on your business needs. If the filter rule is a Perl regular expression, the created filter rule will be a hit rule; in other words, only logs that match the regular expression will be collected and reported.

You can configure a filter rule for JSON logs according to the parsed key-value pair. For example, if you want to collect all log data with a `response_code` field whose value is 400 or 500 from the original JSON log file, you need to configure `key` as `response_code` and the filter rule as `400|500`.

>! The relationship logic between multiple filter rules is "AND". If multiple filter rules are configured for the same key name, previous rules will be overwritten.

### Viewing search results

Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls). In the left sidebar, click **Log Search**, enter the target logset and log topic, and click **Search** to search for logs.


>! Index configuration must be enabled before you can perform searches.
