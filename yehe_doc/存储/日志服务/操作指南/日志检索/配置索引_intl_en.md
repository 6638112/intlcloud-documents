Index configuration is a sufficient condition for using CLS for log search and analysis; that is, search and analysis can be performed only after index is enabled. In addition, different index rules can lead to different search and analysis results. This document describes how to configure an index and how it works.

CLS supports the following index types: 

| Type       | Description                                                         | Configuration Method    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full-text index   | Full-Text index creates an index by splitting a raw log into multiple segments, based on which queries are performed; for example, entering `error` indicates to query logs that contain the keyword `error`.<br>If you use LogListener to collect logs in a single-/multi-line full-text manner, you must enable full-text index before you can search for logs | Console: enable full-text index on the index configuration page.                     |
| Key-value index   | Key-value index creates an index of key-value pairs for the raw log, based on which searches are performed; for example, entering `level:error` indicates to query logs with a `level` field whose value is `error`. | Console: on the index configuration page, enable key-value index and enter the corresponding field name (i.e., the key name `key`), such as `level`. |
| Metadata index | Metadata index is the key-value index in essence, but the key name is identified by `__TAG__` as the prefix field; for example, entering `__TAG__.client:192.168.10.10` indicates to query metadata with a `client` field whose value is `192.168.10.10`. | Console: on the index configuration page, enable key-value index and enter the corresponding metadata field name (i.e., the key name `key`), such as `__TAG__.client`. |

CLS has built-in reserved fields, including the collection source IP `__SOURCE__`, the collection file `__FILENAME__`, and the timestamp `__TIMESTAMP__`, which will be automatically indexed (as the traffic generated by indexing such fields is not billed, no additional fees will be incurred). The reserved fields are as detailed below:

| Built-in Field        | Description                                                     | Fees                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `__FILENAME__`  | Filename for log collection, which can be used to filter filenames; for example, `__FILENAME__:/var/log/access.log` queries logs from the `/var/log/access.log` file. | It is indexed automatically, but the traffic generated by indexing it is not billed, so no fees will be incurred. |
| `__SOURCE__`    | Source IP for log collection, which can be used to filter servers; for example, `__SOURCE__:192.168.10.10` queries logs from the `192.168.10.10` server | It is indexed automatically, but the traffic generated by indexing it is not billed, so no fees will be incurred. |
| `__TIMESTAMP__` | Log timestamp, which can be used for log analysis                        | It is be indexed automatically, but the traffic generated by indexing it is not billed, so no fees will be incurred. |
| `__TAG__`       | Prefix of the metadata field, which is used to distinguish between raw log contents. For more information on how to carry metadata, please see the description of the `LogTag` field in [Uploading Structured Log](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/16873) | It needs to be configured manually. The traffic generated by indexing it will be billed. For more information on the fees, please see the billing description. |



## Full-Text Index

Full-text index allows you to perform searches by using keywords. It splits all field values in the raw log content into several keywords according to the delimiter rules and then creates an index. Therefore, if no key name (i.e., the field name `key`) is specified for keyword queries, searches will be performed based on full-text index.

| Configuration Item     | Description                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Full-text delimiter | A set of characters that split the raw log content into segments. The delimiters <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r\</code> are entered by default in the console. |
| Case Sensitivity | This specifies whether a keyword after segmentation is case-sensitive during queries; for example, if the keyword after segmentation is `Error` and is case-sensitive, `error` cannot be queried. |
| Allow Chinese characters | This feature can be enabled when logs contain Chinese characters need to be searched. After you enable this feature, Chinese characters will be segmented by meaning and indexes will increase; you can increase configurations as appropriate. |


For example, a complete log is as shown below:

```
10.20.20.10;[2018-07-16 13:12:57];GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1;200
```

If you extract key-value pairs from the raw log content as instructed in [Collecting CSV Logs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32285), the structured format uploaded to CLS will be:

```
IP: 10.20.20.10
request: GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1
status: 200
time: [2018-07-16 13:12:57]
```

If the full-text delimiter rule is <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r</code> (including space), all field values in the raw log will be split into the following keywords (each line denotes a keyword):

```
10.20.20.10
GET
online
sample
HTTP
1.1
200
2018-07-16
13
12
57
```

The rule for determining a search hit is that a hit log must contain at least one keyword. For more information, please see the following samples:

- Sample query 1. If you enter `200` for query, the sample log will be hit because it contains the keyword `200`.
- Sample query 2. If you enter `/online/sample` for query, the sample log cannot be returned since `/` is a reserved character (regular expression identifier) in CLS [search syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/30439), which needs to be escaped to `\/online\/sample` by using `\`. As `/` is included in the full-text index delimiter rule, the actual query logic of `\/online\/sample` is `online OR sample`, and other logs that contain the keyword `online` or `sample` may be hit.
- Sample query 3. If you enter `"/online/sample" ` for query, the sample log can be returned. Because `""` is also a reserved character in CLS [search syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/30439), `/`, `online`, and `sample ` contained in `"/online/sample"` are regarded as ordinary characters and don't need to be escaped. As `/` is included in the full-text index delimiter rule, the actual query logic of `"/online/sample"` is `online AND sample` and the word order remains unchanged; however, `"/online/sample"` may hit other logs such as `/online/sample/abc`.

## Key-Value Index

Key-value index creates an index of key-value pairs. An index rule can be configured for each field name (key name), such as the data type, delimiters, and statistics. To perform a key-value query, you must specify the field name, and the query syntax format is `key:value`, such as `status:200`. If no field name is specified, a full-text search will be performed.

>? CLS has built-in reserved fields, including the collection source IP `__SOURCE__`, the collection file `__FILENAME__`, and the timestamp `__TIMESTAMP__`. By default, key-value index is configured, the key-value index delimiters are empty, and statistics collection is enabled. The traffic generated by indexing such fields is not billed, so no fees will be incurred.

| Configuration Item     | Description                                                     | Remarks                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Data Type   | Data type of the field. For example, the `text ` type supports fuzzy query, while the `long` and `double` types support range query. | long - integer (Int 64)<br/>double - floating point (64-bit)<br/>text - string |
| Delimiter     | They are used to segment fields into keywords according to the defined character set. | Default delimiters: <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r</code>                       |
| Allow Chinese Characters     | This feature can be enabled when logs contain Chinese characters need to be searched.   | If this feature is enabled, Chinese statements will be segmented according to semantics, increasing the index volume to some extent. Please use this feature as needed.              |
| Enable Statistics   | After it is enabled, statistical analysis can be performed on fields, such as `group by ${key}` and `sum(${key})`. For more information, please see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/37803).| It is disabled by default.                                                            |
| Case Sensitivity | This specifies whether a keyword after segmentation is case-sensitive during queries; for example, if the keyword after segmentation is `Error` and is case-sensitive, `level:error` cannot be queried. | Case-insensitive by default. |


For example, a complete log is as shown below:

```
10.20.20.10;[2018-07-16 13:12:57];GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1;200
```

If you extract key-value pairs from the raw log content as instructed in [Collecting CSV Logs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32285), the structured format uploaded to CLS will be:

```
IP: 10.20.20.10
request: GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1
status: 200
time: [2018-07-16 13:12:57]
```

If key-value index is configured as follows:

| Key-Value Index Field Name | Delimiters                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------- |
| IP             | <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r </code>|
| request        | <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r </code> |
| status         | <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r </code>|
| time           | <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r </code> |

- Sample query 1. If you enter `IP:10.20.20.10`, the sample log can be returned since the delimiters don't include a period and `10.20.20.10` is regarded as a keyword.
- Sample query 2. If you enter `request:GET /online/sample`, the sample log cannot be returned since `/` is a reserved character (regular expression identifier) in CLS [search syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/30439), which needs to be escaped to `request:GET \/online\/sample`. As `/` is included in the `request` index delimiter rule, the actual query logic of `request:GET \/online\/sample` is `request:GET OR request:online OR request:sample`, and other logs may be hit.
- Sample query 3. If you enter `request:"GET /online/sample"`, the sample log can be retrieved. Because `""` is also a reserved character in CLS [search syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/30439), `GET`, `/`, `online`, and `sample` contained in `request:"GET /online/sample"` are regarded as ordinary characters and don't need to be escaped. However, as `/` is included in the `request` index delimiter rule, the actual query logic of `request:"GET /online/sample"` is `request:(GET AND online AND sample)` and the word order remains unchanged, and other logs such as `request:GET /online/sample/abc` may be hit.



## Metadata Index

When a log is uploaded to CLS, its metadata is passed through the `LogTag` field (for more information, please see the `LogTag` field in [Uploading Structured Log](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/16873)), while the raw log content is passed through the `Log` field. Metadata index needs to be configured for all data which is passed through `LogTag`. Metadata index is key-value index as a matter of fact, and it works and is configured in the same way as key-value index. The only difference is that the metadata field is identified by the specific prefix `__TAG__. `. For example, the `client` metadata field is indexed as `__TAG__.client`.

For example, a complete log is as shown below:

```
10.20.20.10;[2018-07-16 13:12:57];GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1;200
```

If you extract key-value pairs from the raw log content as instructed in [Collecting CSV Logs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32285) which carries the metadata `region:ap-beijing`, the structured format uploaded to CLS will be:

```
IP: 10.20.20.10
request: GET /online/sample HTTP/1.1
status: 200
time: [2018-07-16 13:12:57]
__TAG__.region:ap-beijing
```

Here, metadata index is configured as follows:

| Key-Value Index Field Name  | Delimiters                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| \_\_TAG\_\_.region | <code>@&()='",;:<>[]{}/ \n\t\r</code>|

Sample query: if you enter `__TAG__.region:"ap-beijing"`, the sample log can be returned.


## Notes
1. Log data collected cannot be found when index is disabled.
2. It takes one minute for the log search feature to become available after index is enabled.
3. The data storage time is the same as that in the logset.
4. **Any changes made to the index rule apply only to new data that is written after the changes, and the indexes created for old data will not be updated.**
5. **Queries and analysis are only performed based on one index rule. Therefore, different results may be obtained for the same query and analysis statements if the index rule is changed, as the new index rule changes the data range for queries and analysis.**
