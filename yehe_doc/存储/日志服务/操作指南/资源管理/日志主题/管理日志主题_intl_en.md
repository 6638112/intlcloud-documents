 - Log Topic Name: for example, enter `nginx`.
 - Storage Class: `Real-time` by default. For more information about storage classes, please see [Storage Class Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/42003).
 - Log Retention Period: 30 days by default. You can specify a log storage period, after which logs are automatically cleared. If LogListener is used, and a time field in the log content instead of the collection time is used as the logging time, the time specified by the time field will be used to determine whether a log expires.
 - Logset Operation:
    - Select an existing logset: select a target logset from the **Logset** drop-down list.
    - Create logset:
    Logset Name: for example, enter `cls_test`.
 - Advanced Settings:
    - Partitions: enter a positive integer. It defaults to 1. For more information about topic partitions, see [Topic Partition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/33779).
    - Partition Auto-Split: enabled by default.
    - Maximum Partitions: enter an integer up to 50.
    - Log Topic Tag: set a tag for the current log topic to be created so that resources can be managed by category from different dimensions.
    - Logset Tag: this field is available only when **Logset Operation** is **Create logset**. You can set a tag for the logset to be created.
4. Click **OK**.
After a log topic is created, you can click its ID/name on the Log Topic page to view its details.
