A logset is a project management unit within CLS and used to distinguish between the logs of different projects. One logset corresponds to one project or application. We recommend you manage the logs of different projects and products by using different logsets. For example, if your company runs two types of businesses: ecommerce business and payment business, then you should create a logset for each business type.

A logset can contain multiple [log topics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/32849), and each log topic has the following basic attributes:
- Logset name: the name of a logset.
- Logset ID: the unique ID of a logset.
- Region: the [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/18940) to which the logset belongs.
- Retention period: the retention period of data in the current logset, which can be up to 90 days. If you need a longer retention period, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
