## Examples

#### NGINX log query and analysis

Company A's website receives 100 million requests per day, and each request produces an average of a 100-byte log. This results in 100 million logs per day for a total of approximately 9.31 GB. Company A decides to upload the NGINX access logs to the CLS in the Beijing region, and save them for 15 days for query and statistical analysis.

## Note on Free Log Storage for TKE Audit and Event Center

[Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457) is a high-scalability and high-performance container management service. You can easily run applications in a managed CVM instance cluster. In response to the high complexity of daily OPS of container clusters and difficulties in troubleshooting, CLS and TKE jointly launched the cluster audit and event log center. With the aid of CLS' log data processing capabilities, you can view audit logs and cluster events in real time through visual charts, which helps you improve the efficiency of container cluster OPS with ease. For TKE audit logs and event logs, CLS offers the following **Free Tier perk**:

#### Eligibility
TKE audit/event logs written by log topics automatically created by TKE are eligible for this perk. Such log topics are marked with TKE-Audit or TKE-Event. You can view them on the list page **Log Topic in the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/logset/desc)**.


#### Rules


1. CLS provides free log storage service, so you only need to enable [cluster audit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/38338)/event log in TKE.
2. All features of CLS, such as search and analysis, visual application, and log download and consumption, are available for eligible audit/event logs free of charge.

#### Validity period

Now through 23:59:59 on June 30, 2022.
