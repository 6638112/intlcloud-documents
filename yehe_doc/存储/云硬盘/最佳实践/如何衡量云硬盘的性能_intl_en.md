## Metrics
Tencent Cloud CBS devices vary in performance and price by type. For more information, see [Cloud Disk Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636). Because different applications have different workloads, if the number of I/O requests is low, the cloud disk may not play its full performance.
The following metrics are generally used to measure the performance of a cloud disk:

- IOPS: read/write count per second. IOPS varies by the underlying drive type of the storage device.
- Throughput: read/written data volume per second, unit in MB/s.
- Latency: time elapsed from sending an I/O operation to receiving an acknowledgement (in seconds).

## Testing Tool
FIO is a tool for testing disk performance. It is used to perform stress test and verification on hardware. This document uses FIO as an example.
We recommend that you use FIO together with libaio’s I/O engine to perform the test. Please install FIO and libaio with reference to [Tool Installation](#toolInstallation).

>
>- **To avoid damaging important files in the system, do not perform FIO test on the system disk**.
>- **To avoid data corruption caused by corruption of the metadata of the underlying file system, do not perform the test on the business data disk. **
>- Ensure the `/etc/fstab` file **DOES NOT contain** the mount configuration of the disk to be tested. Otherwise, CVM may fail to launch.

## Recommended Test Objects
- We recommend that you perform FIO test on empty disks that do not store important data, and re-create the file system after completing the test.
- When testing disk performance, we recommend that you directly test raw data disks (such as /dev/vdb).
- When testing file system performance, we recommend you specify the specific file test (such as /data/file).

## Tool Installation
1. Log in to the CVM as instructed in [Log in to Linux Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). Here, take the CVM running CentOS 7.6 OS as an example.
2. Run the following command to check whether the cloud disk is 4KiB-aligned.
```
fdisk -lu
```
As shown below, if the Start value in the command output is divisible by 8, then the disk is 4KiB-aligned. Otherwise, complete 4KiB alignment before testing.

3. Run the following commands in sequence to install the testing tools, FIO and libaio.
```
yum install libaio -y
```
```
yum install libaio-devel -y
```
```
yum install fio -y
```
Once completed, start testing the cloud disk performance as instructed in the test example below.

## Test Example
The testing formulas for different scenarios are basically the same, except the `rw`, `iodepth`, and `bs` (block size) parameters. For example, the optimal `iodepth` for each workload is different as it depends on the sensitivity of your application to the IOPS and latency.
