## Overview
If your cloud disk has a MBR partition that contains the file system, with a disk size of less than 2 TB after expansion, you can use either of the following methods to extend partitions and file systems:
- [Assigning the expanded capacity to an existing MBR partition](#Add)
- [Formatting the expanded capacity into an independent new MBR partition](#New)


## Prerequisites
You can use automatic expansion tools including fdisk, e2fsck and resize2fs to add the expanded cloud disk capacity to the existing file system on a Linux CVM. To ensure a successful expansion, the following requirements must be met:
- The way to expand and partition has been confirmed. For more information, see [Determining the Expansion Method](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/53363).
- The file system is EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, or XFS.
- The current file system does not have any error.
- The disk size after expansion does not exceed 2 TB.
- Only use Python version 2 because of compatibility with expansion tools in this document.



## Directions

[](id:Add)
### Assigning the expanded capacity to an existing MBR partition
Run the following command as the root user to query partitions of the cloud disk.
```
lsblk
```
 - The following output indicates there is only one partition. In this case, you can perform the [automatic expansion](#AutomaticExpansion) using tools.
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/297d678489b57dd70171a8882c9416f4.png)
 - The following output indicates there are two partitions: `vdb1` and `vdb2`. In this case, you need to choose a partition to be extended as instructed in [manual expansion](#ManualExpansion).

<dx-tabs>
::: Automatic Expansion [](id:AutomaticExpansion)
>?This method is only applicable to the scenario where there is only one partition. If you have two or more partitions, choose [manual expansion](#ManualExpansion).
>
1. Run the following command as the root user to unmount the partition.
``` 
umount <Mount point>
```Taking the mount point `/data` as an example, run the following command:
```
umount /data
```
2. Run the following command to download an expansion tool.
```
wget -O /tmp/devresize.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tencentyun/tencentcloud-cbs-tools/master/devresize/devresize.py
```
3. Run the following command to use the tool for expansion.
```
python /tmp/devresize.py <Disk path>
```Taking the disk path `/dev/vdb` and the file system `vdb1` as an example, run the following command:
```
python /tmp/devresize.py /dev/vdb
```
 - If `The filesystem on /dev/vdb1 is now XXXXX blocks long.` is output as follows, the expansion is successful. Then, perform [step 4](#step4MBR).
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/689209e1d1f8a227274e8e65be07d2ec.png)
 - If `[ERROR] - e2fsck failed!!` is output, perform the following steps:
   a. Run the following command to fix the partition where the file system resides.
```
fsck -a <Partition path>
```Taking the disk path `/dev/vdb` and the file system `vdb1` as an example, run the following command:
```
fsck -a /dev/vdb1
```b. After the partition is fixed, run the following command again to use the tool for expansion.
```
python /tmp/devresize.py /dev/vdb
```
4. [](id:step4MBR)Run the following command to manually mount the extended partition. This document uses the mount point `/data` as an example.
```
mount <Partition path> <Mount point>
- If a partition at the partition path `/dev/vdb1` exists before expansion, run the following command:
```
mount /dev/vdb1 /data
```
5. Run the following command to view the partition capacity after expansion.
```
df -h
If the result similar to the following figure is returned, the mounting is successful, and you can see the data disk.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/4f57fd2e0038dc1fba5a4389d01ab7dc.png)
6. Run the following command to view the data information of the original partition after expansion and check whether the new storage space has been added to the file system.
```
ll /data
```
:::
::: Manual Expansion [](id:ManualExpansion)
1. Run the following command as the root user to unmount the partition.
```
umount <Mount point>
```Taking the mount point `/data` as an example, run the following command:
```
umount /data
```
2. Run the following command to extend the `vdb2` partition. Replace `vdb2` with your actual partition when using the command. 
```
growpart /dev/vdb 2
```
3. Run the following command to extend the file system of the partition.
```
resize2fs /dev/vdb2
```If the following output is returned, the file system has been extended.

4. [](id:step4MBR)Run the following command to manually mount the extended partition. This document uses the mount point `/data` as an example.
```
mount <Partition path> <Mount point>
```If a partition at the partition path `/dev/vdb2` exists before expansion, run the following command:
```
mount /dev/vdb2 /data
```
5. Run the following command to view the partition capacity after expansion.
```
df -h
```If the result similar to the following figure is returned, the mounting is successful, and you can see the data disk.

### Formatting the expanded capacity into an independent new MBR partition
1. Run the following command as the root user to view the mounted partition of the data disk.
```
df -h
```
As shown in the following figure, the mounted partition of the data disk is 20 GB.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/4f57fd2e0038dc1fba5a4389d01ab7dc.png)
2. Run the following command to view the data disk that has no partition after expansion:
```
fdisk -l
```
As shown in the following figure, the data disk has been expanded to 30 GB.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/f21420374b4334a790022c95bac1fe0f.png)
3. Run the following command to unmount all mounted partitions.
```
umount <Mount point>
```
Taking the mount point `/data` as an example, run the following command:
```
umount /data
```
>? After all partitions are unmounted from the cloud disk, perform [step 4](#Step4MBR) again.
>
4. [](id:Step4MBR)Run the following command to create a partition.
```
fdisk <Disk path>
```
Taking the disk path `/dev/vdb` as an example, run the following command:
```
fdisk /dev/vdb
```
Perform the following steps in sequence when prompted.
 1. Enter **p** to check existing partitions, such as `/dev/vdb1` in this document.
 2. Enter **n** to create a partition.
 3. Enter **p** to create a primary partition.
 4. Enter **2** to create the second primary partition.
 5. Press **Enter** twice to use the default partition size.
 6. Enter **w** to save the partition table and start partitioning.
 See the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/894ba5a11a73d56a0a165ee7cb49e7c6.png)
>? This document takes creating one partition as an example. You can also create multiple partitions to meet your needs.
>
5. Run the following command to view the new partition.
```
fdisk -l
```
The following figure shows that the new partition `vdb2` has been created.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d604d00955d0db5f052e964ecd409cc3.png)
6. Run the following command to format the new partition and create a file system in a desired format, such as EXT2 or EXT3.
```
mkfs.<fstype> <Partition path> 
```
Taking EXT4 as an example, run the following command:
```
mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb2
```
The following figure shows the successful creation of the EXT file system.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/db15ed11252e6db8adb706f61ed14225.png)
7. Run the following command to create a mount point.
```
mkdir <New mount point>
```
Taking the new mount point `/data1` as an example, run the following command:
```
mkdir /data1
```
8. Run the following command to manually mount the new partition.
```
mount <New partition path> <New mount point>
```
Taking the new partition path `/dev/vdb2` and the new mount point `/data1` as an example, run the following command:
```
mount /dev/vdb1 /data2
```
9. Run the following command to view the new partition.
```
df -h
```
If the result as shown in the following figure is returned, the mounting is successful, and you can see the data disk.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/465c988014acc85957078335d776bfc3.png)
>? To allow the CVM to automatically mount a data disk upon restart or startup, perform [step 10](#AddNewPartINFOstep10) and [step 11](#AddNewPartINFOstep11) to add the new partition to `/etc/fstab`.
10. [](id:AddNewPartINFOstep10)Run the following command to add the partition.
```
echo '/dev/vdb2 /data1 ext4 defaults 0 0' >> /etc/fstab
```
11. [](id:AddNewPartINFOstep11)Run the following command to view the partition.
```
cat /etc/fstab
```
If the result as shown in the following figure is returned, the partition has been successfully added.
