## Use Limits on Cloud Disk
<table>

	<tr>
	  <td>Enhanced SSD usage</td>
		<td> 1. Currently, Enhanced SSD is only available in some availability zones. <br>2. The performance of Enhanced SSD is only guaranteed when itâ€™s attached to S5, M5, and SA2 models created after August 1, 2020, and all later generation models. <br>3. Enhanced SSD cannot be used as the system disk.<br>4. Enhanced SSD cannot be encrypted.<br>5. Enhanced SSD cannot be upgraded from other disk types.</td>

	  <td>Tremendous SSD usage</td>
		<td> 1. Currently, Tremendous SSD is only available in certain availability zones, as shown in the CBS purchase page. It will be supported in more availability zones.<br>2. <b>Tremendous SSD can only be purchased with the Standard Storage Optimized S5se CVM instance.</b><br>3. Tremendous SSD cannot be purchased independently.<br>4. Tremendous SSD cannot be used as the system disk.<br>5. Tremendous SSD cannot be encrypted.<br>6.

		<td>Elastic cloud disk capability</td>
		<td>Starting from May 2018, all data disks purchased upon creation of CVMs are elastic cloud disks. You can detach them from and re-attach them to CVMs. This feature is supported in all availability zones.</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Cloud disk performances</td>
		<td>I/O specification applies to both input and output performance at the same time.<br/>For example, if a 1-TB SSD has a maximum random IOPS of 26,000, it means that both its read and write performance can reach this value. Due to performance limits, if the block size in this example is 4 KB or 8 KB, the maximum IOPS can be reached. If the block size is 16 KB, the maximum IOPS cannot be reached (throughput has already reached the limit of 260 MB/s).</td>

## Use Limits on Snapshot
