## Overview
A cloud disk is an expandable storage device on cloud. After a cloud disk is created, you can expand its capacity at any time to increase its storage capacity without losing any data in it.
After [expanding a cloud disk](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5747), you need to either assign its expanded capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition.



## Prerequisites
>!Extending the file system may affect existing data. We strongly recommend that you manually [create a snapshot](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5755) to back up your data before the operation.
To protect your existing data, you can choose to use the `umount` command to unmount existing partitions and use the `fsck` command to check file systems during the expansion.

- You have [expanded the cloud disk capacity](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5747).
- You have [mounted the cloud disk](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/32401) to a Linux CVM and created a file system.
- You have [logged in to](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436) the Linux CVM on which you want to extend partitions and file systems.

## Directions
### Determining the extension method
<span id="fdisk"></span>
1. Run the following command as the root user to view the partition format of the cloud disk.
```plaintext
fdisk -l
```
 - If the result indicates that the device has no partition (for example, it only shows /dev/vdb), see [Extending the file system](#ExpandTheFileSystem).
 - If the result is as shown in the following two figures (which may vary according to the operating system), the GPT partition format is used.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ce19715fc8494a9735b714d86f0cccfa.png)
 - If the result is as shown in the following figure (which may vary according to the operating system), the MBR partition format is used.
 >! MBR partition supports disk with a maximum capacity of 2 TB. When you partition disk with a capacity greater than 2 TB, we recommend that you create and mount a new data disk and use the GPT partition format to copy data. When the GPT partition is used on a Linux CVM, you have to use the parted partition tool, because fdisk will become unavailable.

### Assigning the expanded capacity to an existing partition (MBR)
You can use automatic expansion tools including fdisk, e2fsck and resize2fs to add the expanded cloud disk capacity to the existing file system on a Linux CVM. To ensure a successful expansion, the following four requirements must be met:
- The file system is EXT2, EXT3, EXT4, or XFS.
- The current file system does not have any error.
- The disk size after expansion does not exceed 2 TB.
- These tools are compatible with Python version 2, but not Python version 3.


1. Run the following command as the root user to unmount the partition:
```plaintext
umount <Mount point>
```
 Taking the mount point `/data` as an example, run the following command:
```plaintext
umount /data
```
 ![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/c0acc05057941681627a5fd34979d194/image.jpg)
2. Run the following command to download an expansion tool.
    This tool is recommended in the Chinese mainland:
```plaintext
wget -O /tmp/devresize.py https://tencentcloud.coding.net/p/tencentcloud/d/tencentcloud-cbs-tools/git/raw/master/devresize/devresize.py
```
 This tool is recommended in regions outside the Chinese mainland:
```plaintext
wget -O /tmp/devresize.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tencentyun/tencentcloud-cbs-tools/master/devresize/devresize.py
```
3. Run the following command to use the tool for expansion:
```plaintext
python /tmp/devresize.py <Disk path>
```
 Taking the disk path `/dev/vdb` and the file system vdb1 as an example, run the following command:
```plaintext
python /tmp/devresize.py /dev/vdb
```
 ![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/c7617b90578192d64d19f02325f00ffb/image.jpg)
 - If "The filesystem on /dev/vdb1 is now XXXXX blocks long." is output, the expansion is successful. Then, perform [Step 4](#step4MBR).
 - If the output is "[ERROR] - e2fsck failed!!", perform the following steps:
   a. Run the following command to fix the partition where the file system resides.
	```plaintext
	fsck -a <Partition path>
	```
	Taking the disk path `/dev/vdb` and the file system vdb1 as an example, run the following command:
	```plaintext
	fsck -a /dev/vdb1
	```
    b. After the partition is fixed, run the following command again to use the tool for expansion.
	```plaintext
	python /tmp/devresize.py /dev/vdb
	```
<span id="step4MBR"></span>
4. Run the following command to manually mount the extended partition:
```plaintext
mount <Partition path> <Mount point>
```
 This document uses the mount point `/data` as an example.
 - If a partition at the partition path `/dev/vdb1` exists before the expansion, run the following command:
```plaintext
mount /dev/vdb1 /data
```
 - If no partition exists before expansion, run the following command:
```plaintext
mount /dev/vdb /data
```
5. Run the following command to view the partition capacity after expansion:
```plaintext
df -h
```
 If the result similar to what is shown below is returned, the mount is successful, and you can see the data disk.
![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/2367f3e70cd0c3c1bef665cc47c1c3bc/image.jpg)
6. Run the following command to view the original partition data after expansion and check whether the file system is added with expanded storage space.
```plaintext
ll /data
```

<span id="CreateANewMBRPart"></span>
### Formatting the expanded capacity into an independent new partition (MBR)
1. Run the following command as the root user to view the partitions of the mounted data disk:

 Taking the mount point `/data` as an example, run the following command:
```plaintext
umount /data
```
 >? Unmount the file systems from all partitions on the cloud disk, and perform the operations in [Step 4](#Step4MBR) again. You can run the following command again to confirm that the unmounting is successful:
```plaintext
mount | grep '<Disk path>'
```
 If the return is null, then all file systems have been unmounted from partitions on the cloud disk.
4. <span id="Step4MBR"></span>Run the following command to create a partition.
```plaintext
fdisk <Disk path>
```
 Taking the disk path `/dev/xvdc` as an example, run the following command:
```plaintext
fdisk /dev/xvdc
```
 When prompted, sequentially enter `p` (to check existing partitions), `n` (to create a partition), `p` (to create a primary partition), `2` (to create the second primary partition), press `Enter` twice (to use the default configuration), enter `w` (to save the partition table), and start the partition, as shown in the following figure:
![](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/8c35d6f4dfb367e74edc27ce6822c317/image.png)
