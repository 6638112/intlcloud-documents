### What is Tencent Cloud Block Storage?
Tencent Cloud Block Storage (CBS) is a highly available and highly reliable block storage device for CVM instances. It provides a wide variety of disks to meet diversified read/write requirements. For more information on CBS, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/2345).
We recommend CBS when the data frequently changes and you want to persistently store them at a faster read/write speed. CBS can be mounted to any running instance in the same availability zone, enabling you to use an instanceâ€™s file system and database storage without following the instance lifecycle. For more information on the CBS operations, see [Operation Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/33140).

### What are the features of Tencent Cloud CBS?
Tencent Cloud CBS comes with four disk types: Premium Cloud Storage, SSD, Enhanced SSD, and Tremendous SSD. All four types offer the following features:
- Elastic mounting and unmounting: elastic cloud disks can be mounted and unmounted. Up to 20 elastic cloud disks can be mounted to a CVM as data disks. 
- Elastic expansion: a single disk supports a maximum capacity of 32 TB. You can scale up the disk at any time.
- Snapshot backup: you can create a snapshot to back up data. This improves data reliability and allows rapid data restoration when necessary. You can also create a cloud disk from the snapshot to accelerate your business deployment.

### What is the difference between COS and CBS?
- [Cloud Object Storage (COS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436) is available via Web APIs, and is not restricted by file systems, directory structure, number of files, or storage capacity. The service offers various SDKs and tools for business integration, which can also be used independently from CVM. COS is great when you need to access massive amounts of data but is not ideal for millisecond-level response or random read/write scenarios.
- [CBS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362) needs to be used together with CVM and can only be mounted and used after the file system is partitioned or formatted. COS and CBS both have distinct performance metrics for different use cases.

### What limits do cloud disks have?
- A single elastic cloud disk can be scaled up to 32 TB, and cannot be scaled down.
- Elastic cloud disks can only be mounted to CVMs within the same availability zone.
- Up to 20 elastic cloud disks can be mounted to a single CVM as data disks. You can directly mount elastic cloud disks to a CVM you are purchasing or [do so later](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/32401).
- You can purchase up to 50 elastic cloud disks at one time on the [CBS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cbs).


### What are the advantages of cloud disks?
Cloud disks offer high reliability, elasticity and performance. They are easy to use and support snapshot backup. For more information, see [Product Strengths](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/3039).

### Can elastic cloud disks be used as system disks?
No. Only non-elastic cloud disks can be used as system disks.

[](id:Q1)
### Can cloud disks be used as data disks?
Yes. All types of local disks and cloud disks can be used as data disks.

### Can cloud disks be mounted and unmounted?
- Cloud disks can be mounted and unmounted when they are used as data disks.
- However they cannot be mounted or unmounted when they are used as system disks.

### Can elastic cloud disks be mounted and unmounted in batches?
- Elastic cloud disks can be mounted and unmounted in batches.
- Non-elastic cloud disks cannot be mounted or unmounted in batches.
