## Billing Example

Suppose you upload a batch of images to a bucket, use CI's image cropping and Guetzli compression features to process the images in real time, and add blind watermarks during upload.

Usage statistics show that the basic image processing usage is 5 TB, the Guetzli compression feature is used 10,000 times, and the blind watermark feature is used 10,000 times. You purchased a 100,000-times image compression resource pack valid for 12 months in the Chinese mainland last month.

The following can be concluded:

| Item | Free Tier | Unit Price | Resource Pack | Billable Usage | Fees (Unit Price * Billable Usage) |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------- |
| Basic image processing | 10 TB     | 0.025 CNY/GB/month | None                   | 0 GB     | 0 CNY                 |
| Guetzli compression  | None       | 1 CNY/1,000 times      | Resource pack of 100,000 image compressions | 0 times     | 0 CNY                 |
| Blind watermark       | None       | 1 CNY/1,000 times      | None                   | 10,000 times | 10 CNY                |
| **Monthly fees**       | -        |     -          |          -            |    -     | **10 CNY**            |

>?
> - CI doesn't bill inbound traffic, so uploading images for real-time processing doesn't incur traffic fees.
> - The deduction order of CI billable items is resource pack > pay-as-you-go. Guetzli compressions can be deducted from image compression resource packs and don't incur pay-as-you-go fees.
> - Storage fees are charged by COS.
