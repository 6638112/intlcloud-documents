## Billing Mode

### How is CI billed?

CI is **pay-as-you-go (postpaid)**. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/33431).

### What are the billable items of CI?

The billable items of CI include [image processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/45582), [media processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49489), [file processing fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49490), and [traffic fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49491).

### Can I change the billing mode of CI? How do I switch from pay-as-you-go billing to resource pack reduction mode?

You don't need to manually modify the billing mode of CI. If there are resource packs under your account, they will be used for deduction first; otherwise, pay-as-you-go billing will be adopted. Currently, resource packs are available only in the Chinese mainland.



## Free Tier

### Does CI offer a free tier?

CI offers a limited free tier to all new users (i.e., individual and enterprise users activating CI for the first time). For more information, see [Free Tier](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49594).

### Why does my account still have overdue payments (with fees deducted) even if I am entitled to the free tier?

The following are some of the possible reasons why your account has overdue payments if your free tier hasn't expired:

- Multiple billable items are used, but the free tier is insufficient to deduct the fees of all the billable items:
- The resource usage is beyond the free tier.
  For example, if CI offers you free basic image processing usage of 10 TB, but your actual usage is 12 TB, the excess of 2 TB will be pay-as-you-go. You can purchase resource packs for this situation.
- 免费额度过期。
  For example, when you activate the content moderation service for the first time, CI will offer you a free tier valid for two months. After the free tier expires, content moderation will be billed in a pay-as-you-go manner. You can view the free tier validity period on the [Resource Pack Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ci/package) page in the CI console.



## Traffic

### How is the public network downstream traffic in CI generated and billed?

Public network downstream traffic is the traffic generated by data transfer from CI to the client over the internet. Traffic generated by downloading an object directly through an object link or by browsing an object at a static website endpoint is public network downstream traffic. For billing details, see [Traffic Fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1045/49491).

### Will downloading files through the CI console, tools, API, or SDK incur public network downstream traffic fees?

The traffic (private or public network traffic) generated by accessing CI is subject to the use case, and only access to CI from a Tencent Cloud product in the same region will be over the private network by default with no public network downstream traffic fees incurred.

### How will CI be billed after it is connected to CDN?

After CI is connected to CDN, the fees incurred by CI and CDN will be billed separately.

- CI fees include data processing fees and CDN origin-pull traffic fees. You can buy CI resource packs on the [purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/ci).
- CDN fees include CDN traffic fees. You can purchase CDN resource packs on the [purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cdn_package).



## Bill

### How do I view bills?

You can view the fees incurred by the use of CI under your account in the [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/summary) in the console. You can also view bucket-level bill details by downloading the usage details in the Billing Center.



## Overdue Payment

### Why can't I use the CI service after topping up my account to a positive balance?

Your account will be automatically unblocked in ten minutes after it is topped up. If your account is still displayed as blocked, the browser may have cached the historical page. In this case, we recommend you **refresh the webpage** or **clear the browser cache** first.
