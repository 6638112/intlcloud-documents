## Use Cases

#### Video platform

For traditional video platforms, reviewers need to watch videos and then manually select thumbnails, which is labor consuming and slows down video release. The intelligent thumbnail feature can quickly select the most striking frames as thumbnails, which saves labor resources and accelerates video release.

#### Family album

At present, most family album services can display only images in loop. For video files in smart albums, the intelligent thumbnail feature can be used to automatically generate album thumbnails for loop display, thereby increasing the richness and utilization of family albums.
