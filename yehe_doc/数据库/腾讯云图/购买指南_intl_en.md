>- Upgrade days = rounded up value of upgrade hours (resource expiration time - current time)

### Upgrade billing example
Suppose you want to upgrade the purchased Basic Edition with 280 remaining hours, which is rounded up to 280 / 24 = 12 days, without adding additional dashboards, and there is a 20 percent discount for this time range.
The corresponding fees will be:(266- 26) \* 12 / (365 / 12) \* 1 =94.74 USD.
The number of additional dashboards is zero, so the total fees are 94.74 USD.
