### How do I request a refund for a purchased instance if I don't need it anymore?
You can request a refund based on your instance type:
- Pay-as-you-go instance: TencentDB for MySQL will return resources directly. Refunds cannot be requested.
- Monthly subscribed instance:
  - 5-day unconditional return: Each account can return one monthly subscribed TencentDB for MySQL instance unconditionally within five (inclusive) days after purchase by default.
  - Standard return: If you have already returned one TencentDB instance unconditionally within five days after purchase, you can further return 199 monthly subscribed instances in the console at any time.

For more information, see [Refund](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/14618). 

### Will my business be affected if I switch the billing mode switch from pay-as-you-go to monthly subscription? How will I be charged then?
Rest assured that access to your business will not be affected during the switch from pay-as-you-go billing to monthly subscription billing. 

For billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/18335). 


### Why are additional fees incurred for my monthly subscribed instance?
Usage of backup capacity that exceeds the free tier will be charged. Check whether your usage of backup capacity exceeds the free tier.
You can view the backup space usage on the database backup page in the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mysql/backup/index). For more information, see [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/32344).

### Will I be charged if my pay-as-you-go instances are idle?
Yes. If you stop using pay-as-you-go instances, terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fees.


### How is the backup capacity billed?
TencentDB for MySQL offers a certain amount of backup capacity for free based on the region. The capacity is equivalent to the sum of the storage capacity of all two-node and three-node instances (including source instances and disaster recovery instances) in the region.
The used space and free space of a single-node instance of cloud disk edition are displayed separately, which can be viewed on the **Backup and Restoration** tab.
