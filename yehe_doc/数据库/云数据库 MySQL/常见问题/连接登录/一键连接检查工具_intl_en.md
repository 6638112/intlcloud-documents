If you are unable to access a TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private or public network, you can use the connectivity checker to easily troubleshoot connectivity issues.

If you encounter a connectivity issue when accessing a TencentDB for MySQL instance from a CVM instance over the private or public network, you can use the connectivity check tool provided in the TencentDB for MySQL console to easily troubleshoot the issue.

## Private Network Connectivity Check
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). In the instance list, click the ID of the instance to be checked and access the instance management page.
2. Select **Connection Check** > **Private Network Check**.
3. Click **Add CVMs to Access This Instance**.
>?Only CVM instances in the same region as the TencentDB for MySQL instance are listed by default. If you need cross-region access, enable network interconnection through a [Cloud Connect Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003).
>
4. Click **Start Check** and a check report will be generated after the check is completed.

5. In the **Operation** column of the check report, click **View Report** to view the check result.
 - If the check status is **Normal**, it means that the CVM instance is allowed to access this TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private network.
 - If the check status is **Abnormal**, it means that the CVM instance cannot access this TencentDB for MySQL instance over the private network. In this case, troubleshoot by following the **Suggested Solution** and connect again.
