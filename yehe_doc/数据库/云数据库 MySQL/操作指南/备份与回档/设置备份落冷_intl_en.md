## Overview
**Transition-to-cold storage**: The feature automatically transitions the storage types of generated data and binlog backup files according to the configured transition-to-cold storage rules to reduce the storage costs.

After you configure the backup retention period in **Auto-Backup Settings**, backup files will be stored according to the backup policy. Within the configured retention period, you can transition the backup files generated N or X days (customizable) ago to standard or archive storage respectively through the **transition-to-cold storage** feature.

**Backup file storage types**
- Standard storage: It is suitable for business scenarios with frequent access and use. It can be used for rollback and cloning, uses no free space, and only supports downloads over the private network.
- Archive storage: It is suitable for business scenarios with infrequent access. It has a minimum storage duration of 180 days and does not support downloads.

## Feature overview
- You can configure to transition backup files generated a certain number of days ago to standard storage. The number can range from 30 days to the configured number of backup retention days.
- You can configure to transition backup files generated a certain number of days ago to archive storage. The number can range from 180 days to the configured number of backup retention days.
- The backup storage type can only be transitioned from hot to cold (general storage > standard storage > archive storage) but not vice versa.
- All the configured transition-to-cold storage policies will be performed at 00:00 (GMT+08:00) on the next day. As lifecycle tasks are executed asynchronously, the execution for backups after the rule is configured will be finished by 24:00 on the next day in most cases. The time is calculated based on the modification time of the transition-to-cold storage configuration.
- Transition-to-cold storage can be configured for data backups and binlog backups separately.
- Transition-to-cold storage can be used together with periodic archive.

## Billing overview
Transitioned backups are stored at lower prices to reduce the storage costs. For billing details, see [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/32344).

## Transition-to-cold storage policy
1. Backup retention period â‰¤ 30 days: Transition-to-cold storage cannot be configured. To configure it, extend the backup retention period to more than 30 days.

## Examples of transition-to-cold storage
**Example 1: Non-archive backup + transition-to-cold storage configuration**
**Background**
Company A has a TencentDB for MySQL instance in Guangzhou region. The data backup retention period is 200 days, and the non-archive backup cycle is every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. On December 31, 2022, the following transition-to-cold storage policy is configured: after a backup file is generated for 90 or 180 days, it will be transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively.
**Transition expectations**
- The transition-to-cold storage policy takes effect on January 1, 2023.
- Existing backup files: Starting from January 1, 2023, existing backup files generated for more than 90 or 180 days are transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively.
- New backup files: Starting from January 1, 2023, newly generated backup files are transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively after 90 or 180 days.

**Example 2: Archive backup + transition-to-cold storage configuration**
**Background**
Company B has a TencentDB for MySQL instance in Guangzhou region. The data backup retention period is 365 days, the non-archive backup cycle is every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday, the archive backup retention period is 365 days, and one backup file is retained periodically per month. On January 31, 2023, the following transition-to-cold storage policy is configured: after a backup file is generated for 90 or 180 days, it will be transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively.
**Transition expectations**
- The transition-to-cold storage policy takes effect on February 1, 2023.
- Existing backup files: Starting from February 1, 2023, existing backup files generated for more than 90 or 180 days are transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively.
- New backup files: Starting from February 1, 2023, newly generated backup files are transitioned to standard or archive storage respectively after 90 or 180 days.
In the backup retention schedule shown in the figure below, each newly generated backup file will be transitioned according to the time configured in the transition-to-cold storage policy, and backups can be transitioned only from hot to cold.
