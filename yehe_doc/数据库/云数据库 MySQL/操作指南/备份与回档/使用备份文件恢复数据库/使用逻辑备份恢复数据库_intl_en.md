## Overview
>?To save storage capacity, physical and logical backups in TencentDB for MySQL will be compressed with qpress and then packed with xbstream offered by Percona.

TencentDB for MySQL supports [logical backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/37796). In the console, you can manually create logical backup files of an entire instance or specified databases/tables and download them. This document describes how to manually restore data from logical backup files.

- The restoration method described in this document only applies to Linux.
- For more information about how to restore data in Windows, please see [Offline Migration of Data > Data Migration with Command Line Tool](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/8464).
- Supported instance architectures: two-node or three-node MySQL

## Directions
### Step 1. Download the backup file
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). In the instance list, click the instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to access the instance management page.
2. On the **Backup and Restoration** > **Data Backup List** tab, locate the backup file to be downloaded and click **Download** in the **Operation** column.
3. We recommend you copy the download link in the pop-up dialog box, log in to a [(Linux) CVM instance in the same VPC as the TencentDB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10517#.E6.AD.A5.E9.AA.A43.EF.BC.9A.E7.99.BB.E5.BD.95.E4.BA.91.E6.9C.8D.E5.8A.A1.E5.99.A8), and run the `wget` command for download over the private network at a higher speed.
>?
>- You can also click **Download** to download it directly, which may take longer.
>- `wget` command format: wget -c 'backup file download address' -O custom filename.xb
>
Example:
```
wget -c 'https://mysql-database-backup-bj-118.cos.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com/12427%2Fmysql%2F42d-11ea-b887-6c0b82b%2Fdata%2Fautomatic-delete%2F2019-11-28%2Fautomatic%2Fxtrabackup%2Fbk_204_10385%2Fcdb-1pe7bexs_backup_20191128044644.xb?sign=q-sign-algorithm%3Dsha1%26q-ak%3D1%26q-sign-time%3D1574269%3B1575417469%26q-key-time%3D1575374269%3B1517469%26q-header-list%3D%26q-url-param-list%3D%26q-signature%3Dfb8fad13c4ed&response-content-disposition=attachment%3Bfilename%3D%2141731_backup_20191128044644.xb%22&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream' -O test0.xb
```

### Step 2. Unpack the backup file
Unpack the backup file with xbstream.
>?xbstream can be downloaded at [Percona's official website](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-XtraBackup-2.4/LATEST/). Please select Percona XtraBackup v2.4.6 or later. For more information on installation, please see [Percona XtraBackup 2.4](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.4/installation.html?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.14.4d8653a6QmHkgI).
```
xbstream -x < test0.xb
```
>?Replace `test0.xb` with your backup file.
>
The unpacking result is as shown below:

### Step 3. Decompress the backup file
1. Download qpress by running the following command:
```
wget -d --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT x.y; rv:10.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/10.0"
http://www.quicklz.com/qpress-11-linux-x64.tar
```
>?If an error is displayed during the `wget` download, you can go to [QuickLZ's official website](http://www.quicklz.com/) to download qpress locally and upload it to the Linux CVM instance. For more information, please see [Uploading Files via SCP to a Linux CVM from Linux](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2133).
2. Extract the qpress binary files by running the following command:
```
tar -xf qpress-11-linux-x64.tar -C /usr/local/bin
source /etc/profile
```
3. Decompress the backup file with qpress.
```
qpress -d cdb-jp0zua5k_backup_20191202182218.sql.qp .
```
>?Find the backup file with `.sql.qp` extension by decompression time and replace `cdb-jp0zua5k_backup_20191202182218` with its filename.
>
The decompressing result is as shown below:

### Step 4. Import the backup file into the target database
Import the .sql file into the target database by running the following command:
```
mysql -uroot -P3306 -h127.0.0.1 -p < cdb-jp0zua5k_backup_20191202182218.sql
```
>?
>- This document takes importing into a local MySQL instance with port 3306 as an example. You can replace it as needed.
>- Replace `cdb-jp0zua5k_backup_20191202182218.sql` with the .sql file extracted by qpress.
