To provide you with more stable and high-quality TencentDB for MySQL service, we will upgrade and optimize its monitoring module in Shanghai region.

## Change time
01:00â€“06:00 AM on February 17, 2023 (Friday) and February 20, 2023 (Monday).

## Detailed schedule
AZs upgraded on February 17, 2023 (Friday): Shanghai Zones 5, 6, and 7.
AZs upgraded on February 20, 2023 (Monday): Shanghai Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4.

## Impact of change
There will be one or two breakpoints in certain monitoring metrics, such as the numbers of abnormally closed client connections, failed connection attempts, full-table scans in join queries, range searches in join queries, table cache hits, table cache misses, and table cache overflows, but they won't affect the operation of your database instances.
Key metrics such as CPU, memory utilization, and read/write rate will not be affected, nor will alarm events such as HA switch and running failures.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
