To provide you with more stable and higher-quality TencentDB for MySQL service, we will **change the calculation formula** of the database monitoring metric **memory utilization**.

## Change time
01:00â€“01:30 AM on Tuesday, May 31, 2022.

## Change description
- Calculation formula before change: Memory utilization = memory usage / purchased memory specification
- Calculation formula after change: Memory utilization = memory usage / (purchased memory specification + overused idle memory)
>?The overused idle memory refers to the additional memory allocated to each instance in a specific proportion when the memory resources of the physical machine are idle. It is automatically allocated by Tencent Cloud and does not involve fees. It reduces the probability of OOM during instance use.

## Impact of change
The change will not affect instance operations. The memory utilization may fluctuate after the change.

## Suggestions for alarm policy adjustment
Adjust the related thresholds of memory utilization in the alarm policy promptly. For detailed directions, see [Alarm Policies (Cloud Monitor)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/8457).
We recommend you set the alarm threshold of memory utilization to 90% after the change. When the memory utilization reaches 95%, there will be a great risk of OOM.

We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
