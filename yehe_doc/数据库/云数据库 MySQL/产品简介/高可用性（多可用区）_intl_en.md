Multi-AZ deployment protects your database against database instance failures and AZ outages. For more information, see [Regions and AZs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/8458).

In TencentDB for MySQL, multiple AZs are combined to enable multi-AZ deployment to ensure high availability and failover capability of database instances.

>?
>- No matter whether the TencentDB for MySQL instances in a database cluster are running across multiple AZs or not, each instance has a replica for real-time hot backup to ensure high database availability.
>- With multi-AZ deployment, TencentDB for MySQL automatically presets and maintains a sync replica in a different AZ.
>- The source database instance is synchronously replicated to the replica across AZs to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and minimize latency during system backups.
