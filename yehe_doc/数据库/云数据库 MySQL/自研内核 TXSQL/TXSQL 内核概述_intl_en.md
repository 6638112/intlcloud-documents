TXSQL is a MySQL kernel branch maintained by the TencentDB team and is fully compatible with native MySQL. It provides various features similar to those in the MySQL Enterprise Edition, such as enterprise-grade transparent data encryption (TDE), auditing, dynamic thread pool, encryption function, backup and restoration, and parallel query.

TXSQL not only deeply optimizes the InnoDB storage engine, query performance, and replication performance, but also improves the ease of use and maintainability of TencentDB for MySQL. While providing all the benefits of MySQL, it offers more enterprise-grade advanced features such as disaster recovery, restoration, monitoring, performance optimization, read/write separation, TDE, and auditing.
