## Check details
- In Redis migration scenarios, if the target database is TencentDB for Redis, the number of databases in the source instance must be not greater than or equal to that in the target instance.
- Check whether the status of the source instance is normal.


## Troubleshooting
- Modify the number of databases of the source and target instances and restart the verification task.
- Confirm the status of the source instance.
