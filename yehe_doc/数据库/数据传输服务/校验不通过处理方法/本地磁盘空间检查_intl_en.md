## Check Details
Check whether the disk space on the server of the source database is sufficient. During migration of a self-built source database, at least 50 GB disk space should be reserved on the server of the source database. We recommend you reserve a space at least 1.5 times the size of the migration data to avoid errors during migration.

## Fix
Delete some data from the server of the source database to free up sufficient space.
