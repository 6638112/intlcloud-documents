## TDSQL for MySQL Check Details

- If the target database is TDSQL for MySQL, we recommend you create a partitioned table and specify a shardkey in the target database in advance; otherwise, the task will report a warning. You can ignore the warning and continue with the task. After the warning is ignored, DTS will create a table in the target database based on the source database table paradigm. If the source database is a standalone instance, DTS will create a single table.
- If you have already created a partitioned table in the target database or donâ€™t need one, DTS will check whether the source and target database table structures are consistent. The verification will fail if the field types, field names, or encoding methods are inconsistent.

## Troubleshooting

When the verification fails, DTS will display the list of tables with inconsistent table structures. You can modify the target table structure based on the inconsistencies.
