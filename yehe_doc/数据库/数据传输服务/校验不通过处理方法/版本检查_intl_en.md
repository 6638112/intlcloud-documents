## MySQL/TDSQL for MySQL Check Details 
- Check requirements: the target database version must be above or equal to the source database version, and all versions in migration and sync tasks must meet the version requirements.
- Check description: here, the versions are differentiated by the major version number; for example, v5.6.x supports migration or sync to v5.6.x, v5.7.x, and above. The last digit is the minor version number, which is not restricted; for example, v5.6.5 can be migrated or synced to v5.6.4, but there may be compatibility issues.

## PostgreSQL Check Details
- Versions below PostgreSQL 10.x (such as 9.x) do not support full + incremental migration. If an incremental migration task is configured for the source database, the verification will fail.

- If the versions are different, there may be some special compatibility issues, and a warning will be displayed during migration. You can read the compatibility report of each version to check whether your business uses some incompatible features.

## MongoDB Check Details
The source and target database versions must be supported by MongoDB.

## SQL Server Check Details

Only migration from Basic Edition to High Availability Edition (including Dual-Server High Availability Edition and Cluster Edition) is supported, and the version number of the target database must be above that of the source database. 

## Fix
Check the source and target databases as instructed in [Databases Supported for Data Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42647) and [Databases Supported for Data Sync](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42579). If the source or target database version is not supported, upgrade the target database version or use a database instance on a higher version.
