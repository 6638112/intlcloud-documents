This document describes how to use the data sync feature of DTS to sync data from MySQL to TencentDB for MySQL.

## Notes
- During full data sync, DTS consumes certain source database resources, which may increase the load and pressure of the source database. If your database configuration is low, we recommend you sync the data during off-peak hours.
- To avoid duplicate data, make sure that the tables to be synced have a primary key or non-null unique key.

## [Prerequisites](id:qttj)
- The source and target databases must meet the requirements for the sync feature and version as instructed in [Databases Supported by Data Sync](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42579).
- Permissions required of the source database:
```sql  
GRANT RELOAD,LOCK TABLES,REPLICATION CLIENT,REPLICATION SLAVE,SELECT ON *.* TO 'migration account'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'migration password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `__tencentdb__`.* TO 'migration account'@'%'; // If the source database is a TencentDB database, you need to grant the `__tencentdb__` permission
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
- Permissions required of the target database: ALTER, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE, CREATE ROUTINE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE USER, CREATE VIEW, DELETE, DROP, EVENT, EXECUTE, INDEX, INSERT, LOCK TABLES, PROCESS, REFERENCES, RELOAD, SELECT, SHOW DATABASES, SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER, and UPDATE.

## Application Restrictions
- Only basic tables and views can be synced, and objects such as functions, triggers, and stored procedures are not supported. 
- When a view is exported, DTS will check whether `user1` corresponding to `DEFINER` (`[DEFINER = user1]`) in the source database is the same as the sync user `user2`, and if not, DTS will change the `SQL SECURITY` attribute of `user1` in the target database from `DEFINER` to `INVOKER` (`[INVOKER = user1]`), and set the `DEFINER` in the target database to the sync user `user2` (`[DEFINER = user2]`).
- If the source MySQL database is a non-GTID database, DTS doesn't support HA switch for it. If it is switched, DTS incremental sync may be interrupted.
- Only data with the following three database engines can be synced: InnoDB, MySIAM, and TokuDB. Tables with other engines will be skipped during synching by default.
- Correlated data objects need to be synced together; otherwise, sync will fail. Common correlations include table reference by views, view reference by views, view/table reference by stored procedures/functions/triggers, and tables correlated through primary/foreign keys.
- During incremental sync, if the source database has distributed transactions or generates binlog statements in the `STATEMENT` format, sync will fail.
- If the source database is Alibaba Cloud ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL, then the tables to be synced on v5.6 must have a primary key, while tables on v5.7 and later are unrestricted. If the source database is Amazon RDS for MySQL, then the tables to be synced must have a primary key.

## Operation Restrictions
During the sync, do not perform the following operations; otherwise, the sync task will fail:
- Do not modify or delete user information (including username, password, and permissions) in the source and target databases and port numbers.
- Do not run distributed transactions in the source database.
- Do not write binlog data in the `STATEMENT` format into the source database.
- Do not clear binlogs in the source database.
- Do not delete the system table `__tencentdb__` during incremental sync. 

## Synchronizable SQL Operations

| Operation Type | SQL Statements                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DML      | INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE                                       |
| DDL      | CREATE DATABASE, DROP DATABASE, ALTER DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE, RENAME TABLE, CREATE VIEW, DROP VIEW, CREATE INDEX, and DROP INDEX |

5. On the **Set sync options and objects** page, set the data initialization, data sync, and sync object options and click **Save and Go Next**.
>?
>- If you only select **Full data initialization** for **Initialization Type**, the system will assume by default that you have created the table structures in the target database and will neither migrate table structures nor check whether the source and target databases have tables with the same name. Therefore, if you select **Precheck and report error** for **If Target Already Exists**, the precheck and error reporting feature won't take effect.
>- If you select **Full data initialization** only, you need to create the table structures in the target database in advance.
>- If you want to use a tool such as gh-ost and pt-osc to perform online DDL operations on a table during sync, you must select the entire database (or entire instance) where the table resides rather than only the table as the **sync object**; otherwise, the temporary table data generated by online DDL changes cannot be synced to the target database.
>- If you want to rename a table (for example, rename table A to table B) during sync, you must select the entire database (or entire instance) where table A resides rather than only table A as the **sync object**; otherwise, the system will report an error.

6. On the task verification page, complete the verification. After all check items are passed, click **Start Task**.
    If the verification failed, fix the problem as instructed in [Fix for Verification Failure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552) and initiate the verification task again.
 - Failed: it indicates that a check item failed and the task is blocked. You need to fix the problem and run the verification task again.
 - Alarm: it indicates that a check item doesn't completely meet the requirements, and the task can be continued, but the business will be affected. You need to assess whether to ignore the alarm or fix the problem and continue the task based on the alarm message.

7. Return to the data sync task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Running** status.
>?You can click **More** > **Stop** in the **Operation** column to stop a sync task. You need to ensure that data sync has been completed before stopping the task.
