Data sync refers to the real-time sync of data between two data sources in the form of a continuous task. After a task is created, the data will be continuously synced (almost in real time) to keep consistency between the source and target databases.

DTS supports the sync of self-built, TencentDB, and third-party cloud databases to TencentDB.

- Cloud-local sync: DTS can sync an IDC-based self-built database to a TencentDB instance and vice versa.
- Cross-cloud sync: DTS can sync a third-party cloud database to TencentDB instance.
- Cross-TencentDB instance sync: DTS can sync TencentDB instances in various scenarios, such as multi-site active-active, cross-border, and cross-Tencent Cloud account sync.

You can select different access types for different deployment modes of the source database. DTS supports the following access types: **Public Network**, **Self-Build on CVM**, **Direct Connect**, **VPN Access**, **Database**, and **CNN**. Each access type has different requirements for network conditions. For more information, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652).

Data sync supports various complex topology structures, such as one-to-many, many-to-one, two-way, and ring sync. To create a complex topology, see [Creating Two-Way Sync Data Structure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42605), [Creating Many-to-One Sync Data Structure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42604), or [Creating Multi-Site Active-Active IDC Architecture](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42603).

>- "To Tencent Cloud" refers to scenarios where the target database is a TencentDB instance. "From Tencent Cloud" refers to scenarios where the target database isn't a TencentDB instance.
>- Sync requirement: At least one of the source and target databases must be a Tencent Cloud database instance.
>- The target database version must be later than or equal to the source database version.
>- To use the sync feature of TDSQL for MySQL (as the source or target database), [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.
>- To sync data from MySQL/MariaDB/Percona to TencentDB for MariaDB or from MariaDB/Percona to TencentDB for MySQL, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.
>- Cross-account sync refers to the sync of data between the source and target TencentDB instances under different root accounts. For detailed directions, see [Cross-Account TencentDB Instance Sync](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/47336).
