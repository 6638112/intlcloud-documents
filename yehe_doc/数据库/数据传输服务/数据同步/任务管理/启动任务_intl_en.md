## Overview
If an exception occurs during task verification before a sync task starts, the task will be verified again after you fix it. In this case, you need to start the task after successful verification.

## Prerequisites
The task has passed data verification.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [DTS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dts/migration), select **Data Sync** on the left sidebar, select the target sync task, and click **More** > **Start** in the **Operation** column.
2. In the pop-up window, confirm that everything is correct and click **OK**.<br>
