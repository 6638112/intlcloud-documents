| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Prepare               | Before creating a data migration task, you need to [prepare](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652) the source and target databases and a network environment to meet the environment requirements. |
| 2. Create a data migration task | This section provides only a basic sample migration task. For more scenarios, see [Data Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42645). |
| 3. View the task progress or perform other operations | <li>You can view the overall migration progress and details and perform operations such as verification and retry as instructed in [Task Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42637).<li>You can view various data migration metrics as instructed in [Viewing Monitoring Metric](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42606).</li> |
| 4. Perform business cutover               | You need to select an appropriate time for business cutover to reduce the impact on the business. For more information, see [Cutover Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42612). |

6. Return to the data migration task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Preparing** status. After 1â€“2 minutes, the data migration task will be started.
   - Select **Structural migration** or **Full migration**: once completed, the task will be stopped automatically.
   - Select **Full + Incremental migration**: after full migration is completed, the migration task will automatically enter the incremental data sync stage, which will not stop automatically. You need to click **Complete** to manually stop the incremental data sync.
     - Select an appropriate time to manually complete the incremental data sync and perform business switch.
     - You can see that the migration task is in the incremental sync stage, and there is no latency. Stop writing the source database for several minutes.
     - When the source-target database data gap is 0 MB, and the source-target database time lag is 0s, manually complete the incremental sync.
