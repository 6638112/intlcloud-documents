| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1. Prepare               | Before creating a data migration task, you need to prepare the source and target databases and a network environment as instructed in [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652) to meet the environment requirements. |
| 2. Create a data migration task | This section provides only a basic sample migration task. For more scenarios, see [Migration from MySQL to TencentDB for MySQL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42645). |
| 3. View the task progress or perform other operations | <li>You can view the overall migration progress and details and perform operations such as verification and retry as instructed in [Viewing Task](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42637).<li>You can view various data migration metrics as instructed in [Viewing Monitoring Metric](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42606).</li> |
| 4. Perform business cutover               | You need to select an appropriate time for business cutover to reduce the impact on the business. For more information, see [Cutover Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42612). |

## Sample data migration task

1. Log in to the [DTS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dts/migration), select **Data Migration** on the left sidebar, and click **Create Migration Task** to enter the **Create Migration Task** page.

6. Return to the data migration task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Preparing** status. After 1â€“2 minutes, the data migration task will be started.
   - Select **Structural migration** or **Full migration**: Once completed, the task will be stopped automatically.
   - Select **Full + Incremental migration**: After full migration is completed, the migration task will automatically enter the incremental data sync stage, which will not stop automatically. You need to click **Complete** to manually stop the incremental data sync.
     - Manually complete incremental data sync and business switchover at appropriate time.
     - Check whether the migration task is in the incremental sync stage without any lag. If so, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes.
     - Manually complete incremental sync when the data gap between the target and the source databases is 0 MB and the time lag between them is 0 seconds.
