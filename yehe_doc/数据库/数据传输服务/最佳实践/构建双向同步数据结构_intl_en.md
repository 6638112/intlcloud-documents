## Overview
DTS supports two-way data sync between two databases, which can be applied to multi-site active-active scenarios. In a two-way sync task, two one-way sync tasks are created to establish a two-way topology, and data can be written into both databases at the same time during sync.

As a two-way sync task consists of two one-way sync tasks to establish a two-way topology, restrictions on one-way sync and relevant operations must be followed. For more information, see the appropriate sync scenario in [Data Sync](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42579).

## Notes
- During full data sync, DTS consumes certain source database resources, which may increase the load and pressure of the source database. If your database configuration is low, we recommend you sync the data during off-peak hours.
- To avoid duplicate data, make sure that the tables to be synced have a primary key or non-null unique key. 
- You should plan the data in advance. The two source databases are responsible for updating (adding, deleting, and modifying) data with different primary keys so as to avoid problems such as primary key conflict and mutual overwriting of data with the same primary key. If there are duplicate primary keys in the two source databases for business reasons, select an appropriate conflict resolution method as instructed in [Recommended Configurations for Typical Use Cases](#tjpz) to make the sync behavior and data meet the expectations.

## Application Restrictions
- DDL statements can be executed in at most one direction during two-way sync, as the sync linkage should not form a ring (you can run DDL statements in either the forward or reverse direction).
- Currently, a two-way sync task can be created between two MySQL databases, two TDSQL-C for MySQL databases, or one MySQL database and one TDSQL-C for MySQL database.

## [Recommended Configurations for Typical Use Cases](id:tjpz)
A two-way sync task consists of two one-way sync tasks to establish a two-way topology. The creation steps for each one-way sync task are similar to those for a general one-way sync task. They differ only in the following sync option settings:

</dx-fold-block>

The following configurations are recommended for typical use cases for your reference.
Example: a two-way sync task consisting of two one-way sync tasks (1 and 2) needs to be created between databases A and B: A > B (task 1) and B > A (task 2).

## Directions
This document uses MySQL two-way sync (where database A has database/table structures and data, and database B has only database/table structures but no data) as an example. The two-way sync operations for other databases are similar.

### Creating sync task 1: forward sync (database A > database B)
1. Log in to the [data sync purchase page](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/migration), select appropriate configuration items, and click **Buy Now**.
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>

<tr>
<td>Source Database Type</td><td>Select MySQL (including TencentDB for MySQL and self-built MySQL).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Source Database Region</td><td>Select the source database A region.</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
2. After successful purchase, return to the [data sync list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dts/replication), and you can see the newly created data sync task. You need to configure it before you can use it.
3. In the data sync list, click **Configure** in the **Operation** column to enter the sync task configuration page.
4. On the sync task configuration page, configure the source and target databases and their accounts and passwords, test the connectivity, and click **Next**.

</tbody></table>
6. On the task verification page, the system will check the DDL configuration first and then check the source and target database parameters. After all check items are passed, click **Start Task**.
>?
>- If the verification failed, fix the problem as instructed in [Fix for Verification Failure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552) and initiate the verification task again.
>- If an alarm is displayed in the verification result, it will not affect the task start, but we recommend you click **View Details** to get the suggestions for adjustment.
>
 - DDL check
 - Source and target database parameter check
7. Return to the data sync task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Running** status.

### Creating sync task 2: reverse sync (database B > database A)
The operations of the two sync tasks are basically the same. The following only describes their differences:
1. Set the sync source and target databases.
Swap the settings of the source and target databases in task 1.
2. Set the sync options and objects.
 - Initialization Type: do not select.
 - If Target Already Exists: select **Ignore and execute**.
 - Conflict Resolution Method: select the same option as selected in task 1.
 - SQL Type: in two-way sync, you can select DDL in at most one task. In this document, select DDL in task 1 but not task 2.

### Stopping sync task
If you no longer need a sync task, you can select **More** > **Stop** in the **Operation** column to stop it.
