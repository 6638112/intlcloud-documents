## Overview

After you create migration, sync, or subscription tasks, if you want to receive only the event alarm notifications of tasks with specified IDs but not other tasks, you can refer to this document for configuration. 

## Directions

1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb).
2. The system will ask you to authorize the service as instructed in [Activating EventBridge](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42272) when you log in for the first time. If you have already authorized it, skip this step.
3. Select **Event rule** on the left sidebar, select the **Guangzhou** region and **Default** event bus, and click **Create event rule**.
As the event buses of Tencent Cloud services are uniformly stored in Guangzhou by default, you cannot select other options for the region and event bus here.

4. Configure the event rule and click **Next**.
  - Rule name: Enter a rule name to distinguish between services, which cannot be modified once configured.
  - Rule pattern: Select **Custom events**.
  - Rule pattern preview: Copy the following sample code and replace the sample task ID with the actual ID of the DTS task to be monitored. You can separate multiple tasks by comma.

// Example of receiving notifications for a single task ID
    {
     "source":"dts.cloud.tencent",
     "subject":"sync-jt12XXgt"
    }
		
// Example of receiving notifications for multiple task IDs
    {
     "source":"dts.cloud.tencent",
     "subject":["sync-jt12XXgt","dts-a5uqXXhs"]
    }
```

5. Configure the notification method, recipient, and delivery method, select **Notification message** for **Trigger method**, and click **Complete**.
To add a new recipient user or user group, go to the [CAM](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam) console for creation and then select it in **Recipients** in this step.
To configure different trigger methods, click **Add** at the bottom to add more delivery targets.

6. Return to the event rule list and confirm that the created event rule has been enabled. Subsequently, when a task exception triggers an alarm, the configured recipients will receive message notifications.
