## Overview
You can use CM to set alarm rules for important metrics during data sync. CM will send notifications to you as soon as a metric becomes abnormal, so you can take corresponding measures.  

This document describes how to set notification rules for metric alarms, including the trigger condition and scope of metric alarms, form of notifications, time period for notifications, and recipient group. 

## Adding an alarm policy
1. Log in to the [CM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor).
2. Select **Alarm Configuration** > **Alarm Policy** on the left sidebar to enter the alarm policy configuration page.
3. Click **Create** and configure a new alarm policy as detailed below:
