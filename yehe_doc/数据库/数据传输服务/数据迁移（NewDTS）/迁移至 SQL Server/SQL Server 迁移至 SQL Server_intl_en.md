This document describes how to use the data migration feature of DTS to migrate data from SQL Server to TencentDB for SQL Server.

## Notes 
- When DTS performs full data migration, it will occupy certain source instance resources, which may increase the load of the source instance and the database pressure. If your database has low configurations, we recommend that you migrate data during off-peak hours.
- Full migration is implemented with tables locked, during which write operations will be blocked for seconds.

## Prerequisites
- You have [created a TencentDB for SQL Server instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/31571).
- The source and target databases must meet the requirements for the migration feature and version as instructed in [Databases Supported by Data Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42647).
- You have completed all the preparations as instructed in [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652).
- The service where the source database is located must open the file sharing port 445.
- The source database must be set to "full recovery mode", and we recommend you make a full backup before migration.
- The local disk space of the source database must be large enough, so that the remaining free space can fit the size of the database to be migrated. 
- If the source instance is not a TencentDB for SQL Server or TencentDB for SQL Server Basic Edition instance (such as a public network/CVM-based self-built instance or instance on another cloud), an account with the `sysadmin` permission needs to be used in the target database for migration, and the `xp_cmdshell` stored procedure must be able to run. If the source instance is a TencentDB for SQL Server High-Availability Edition or Cluster Edition instance, there is no permission restriction on the target database account.
- You need to change to "local" for SQL service startup in the source database. The source database account is unrestricted but needs to have the sysadmin permissions.
The SQL service of the source database is running, and the login identity's built-in account in the startup configuration needs to be changed to **Local System**.

## Application restrictions
- Only one migration task can be initiated at any time for the same source instance.
- Currently, cross-region migration is supported between the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong (China) but not between other regions.
- Only database-level migration is supported (i.e., all objects in the database must be migrated together), while single-table migration is not supported.
- Logins, job agents, triggers, and database links (link server) at the instance level cannot be migrated.

## Operation restrictions
- Do not modify or delete user information (including username, password, and permissions) in the source and target databases and port numbers during migration; otherwise, the migration task will fail.
- Do not perform transaction log backup during incremental sync; otherwise, the transaction log will be truncated and become discontinuous.
- If you only perform full data migration, do not write new data into the source instance during migration; otherwise, the data in the source and target databases will be inconsistent. In scenarios with data writes, to ensure the data consistency in real time, we recommend you select full + incremental data migration.
- For full + incremental data migration, after you click **Complete** and the task status becomes **Completed**, do not write new data to the source database. We recommend you stop writing for two minutes; otherwise, the data in the source and target databases may be inconsistent.

## Supported SQL operations
| Operation Type | Supported SQL Operations                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DML      | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and REPLACE                              |
| DDL      | TABLE: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE, and RENAME TABLE <br>VIEW: CREATE VIEW, ALTER VIEW, and DROP VIEW<br>INDEX: CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX <br>DATABASE: CREATE DATABASE, ALTER DATABASE, and DROP DATABASE |

## Environment requirements
>?The system will automatically check the following environment requirements before starting a migration task and report an error if a requirement is not met. If you can identify the failed check item, fix it as instructed in [Database Connection Check](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552); otherwise, wait for the system verification to complete and fix the problem according to the error message.

| **Type** | **Environment Requirements** |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source database requirements | <li>The service where the source instance resides must open the file sharing port 445. <br><li>The source and target databases can be connected. <br/><li>The server where the source database resides must have enough outbound bandwidth; otherwise, the migration speed will be affected. |
| Target database requirements | <li>Only migration from Basic Edition to High Availability Edition (including Dual-Server High Availability Edition and Cluster Edition) is supported, and the version number of the target instance must be later than that of the source database.<br/><li>The target database cannot have the same name as the source database. <br/><li>The disk space of the target database must be at least 1.5 times the size of the source database. <br/><li>The target database cannot have access requests or active businesses; otherwise, migration will fail. </li> |

5. On the task verification page, verify the task. After the verification is passed, click **Start Task**.
    If the verification failed, fix the problem as instructed in [Database Connection Check](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552) and initiate the verification task again.
 - Failed: It indicates that a check item fails and the task is blocked. You need to fix the problem and run the verification task again.
 - Alarm: It indicates that a check item doesn't completely meet the requirements, and the task can be continued, but the business will be affected. You need to assess whether to ignore the alarm or fix the problem and continue the task based on the alarm message.
6. Return to the data migration task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Preparing** status. After 1–2 minutes, the data migration task will be started.
   - Select **Full migration**: Once completed, the task will be stopped automatically.
   - Select **Full + Incremental migration**: After full migration is completed, the migration task will automatically enter the incremental data sync stage, which will not stop automatically. You need to click **Complete** to manually stop the incremental data sync.
      - Manually complete incremental data sync and business switchover at appropriate time.
      - After the migration stage status becomes **Prepared**, stop writing data to the source database for a few minutes and then manually complete incremental sync.
7. (Optional) If you want to view, delete, or perform other operations on a task, click the task and select the target operation in the **Operation** column. For more information, see [Viewing Task](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42637).
8. After the migration task status becomes **Task successful**, you can formally cut over the business. For more information, see [Cutover Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42612).
