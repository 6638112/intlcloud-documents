Data migration is a one-time task of replicating data from the source database to the target database at the database level. After the migration is completed, the business will be cut over to the new database.

DTS supports data migration from self-built databases, TencentDB databases, and third-party cloud databases.

- Migration from a self-built database to the cloud: Migrating a self-built database in the local IDC or on CVM, or a Lighthouse database on the Lighthouse instance to a TencentDB database.
- Migration between TencentDB instances: Such as database version upgrade, cross-region migration (including migration between regions inside China or outside China, or cross-border migration), and the migration between database instances under different Tencent Cloud accounts.
- Migration from a third-party cloud database to TencentDB: Such as migration from an Alibaba Cloud or AWS database to TencentDB.

You can select different access types based on the deployment modes of the source databases. DTS supports the following access types: Public Network, Self-Build on CVM, Direct Connect, VPN Access, Database, and CCN, each requiring different network conditions. For more information, see [Preparations Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652).

>- In the above table, the migration direction “To Tencent Cloud” indicates that the target database is a TencentDB instance, just as shown in the **Target Database Type & Version** column.
>- Cross-account migration only makes sense when both the source and target databases are TencentDB instances under different Tencent Cloud root accounts. For more information on such migration, see [Cross-account TencentDB Instance Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42646). 
>- Requirements for database versions:
>   - MySQL/TDSQL for MySQL/MariaDB/TDSQL-C: The target database version must be later than or the same as the source database version. The versions are differentiated by the major version number; for example, v5.6.x can be migrated to v5.6.x, v5.7.x, or later.
>   - PostgreSQL: For full migration, the target database version must be later than or the same as the source database version; for incremental migration, migration between versions above v10.x is supported. 
>   - MongoDB: Migration between all versions is supported.
>   - SQL Server: Only migration from Basic Edition to High Availability Edition (including Dual-Server High Availability Edition and Cluster Edition) is supported, and the version number of the target database must be above that of the source database.
>- The above table lists the features supported by NewDTS. For Redis data migration, see [Migration with DTS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31941).
