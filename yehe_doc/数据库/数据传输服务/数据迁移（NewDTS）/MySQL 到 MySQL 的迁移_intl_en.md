This document describes how to use DTSâ€™s data migration feature to migrate data from MySQL to TencentDB for MySQL.

## Notes 
- During full data migration, DTS consumes certain source database resources, which may increase the load and pressure of the source database. If your database configuration is low, we recommend you migrate the data during off-peak hours.
- Full migration is implemented with tables locked, causing write operations to be blocked for a few seconds.

## Prerequisites
- You have created a [TencentDB for MySQL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/37785) instance.
- The source and target databases must meet the requirements for the migration feature and version as instructed in [Databases Supported by Data Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42647).
- You have completed all [preparations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42652).
- The source database must have the following permissions:
  - Migration of the entire instance:
```
CREATE USER 'migration account'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'migration password';  
GRANT RELOAD,LOCK TABLES,REPLICATION CLIENT,REPLICATION SLAVE,SHOW DATABASES,SHOW VIEW,PROCESS ON *.* TO 'migration account'@'%';  
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `__tencentdb__`.* TO 'migration account'@'%'; // If the source database is a TencentDB database, you need to grant the `__tencentdb__` permission  
GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'migration account';
```
  - Migration of specified objects:
```
CREATE USER 'migration account'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'migration password';  
GRANT RELOAD,LOCK TABLES,REPLICATION CLIENT,REPLICATION SLAVE,SHOW DATABASES,SHOW VIEW,PROCESS ON *.* TO 'migration account'@'%';  
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `__tencentdb__`.* TO 'migration account'@'%'; // If the source database is a TencentDB database, you need to grant the `__tencentdb__` permission  
GRANT SELECT ON `mysql`.* TO 'migration account'@'%';
GRANT SELECT ON database to be migrated.* TO 'migration account';
```
- Permissions required of the target database: ALTER, ALTER ROUTINE, CREATE, CREATE ROUTINE, CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES, CREATE USER, CREATE VIEW, DELETE, DROP, EVENT, EXECUTE, INDEX, INSERT, LOCK TABLES, PROCESS, REFERENCES, RELOAD, SELECT, SHOW DATABASES, SHOW VIEW, TRIGGER, and UPDATE.

## Application Restrictions
- Only basic tables and views can be migrated, and objects such as functions, triggers, and stored procedures are not supported.
- System databases/tables and user information including `information_schema`, `sys`, `performance_schema`, `__cdb_recycle_bin__`, `__recycle_bin__`, `__tencentdb__`, and `mysql` cannot be migrated. After the migration is completed, if you want a view, stored procedure, or function in the target database to be called, you must grant the caller the read/write permissions. 
- When a view is exported, DTS will check whether `user1` corresponding to `DEFINER` (`[DEFINER = user1]`) in the source database is the same as `user2` in the migration target, and if not, DTS will change the `SQL SECURITY` attribute of `user1` in the target database from `DEFINER` to `INVOKER` (`[INVOKER = user1]`), and set the `DEFINER` in the target database to `user2` of the migration target (`[DEFINER = migration target user2]`).
- If the source MySQL database is a non-GTID database, DTS doesn't support HA switch for it. If it is switched, DTS incremental sync may be interrupted.
- Only data with InnoDB, MySIAM, and TokuDB database engines can be migrated. Other data table engines will be skipped by default during migration.
- Correlated data objects need to be migrated together; otherwise, migration will fail. Common correlations include table reference by views, view reference by views, view/table reference by stored procedures/functions/triggers, and tables correlated through primary/foreign keys.
- During incremental migration, if the source database has distributed transactions or generates binlog statements in the `STATEMENT` format, the migration will fail.
- In migration without locks (the source database is Alibaba Cloud ApsaraDB RDS for MySQL 5.6, Alibaba Cloud PolarDB for MySQL 5.6, or Amazon RDS for MySQL, and the target database is TencentDB for MySQL), DDL operations are not supported during full migration.

## Operation Restrictions
- During the migration, do not perform the following operations; otherwise, the migration task will fail:
  - Do not modify or delete user information (including username, password, and permissions) in the source and target databases and port numbers.
  - Do not run distributed transactions in the source database.
  - Do not write binlog data in the `STATEMENT` format into the source database.
  - Do not clear binlogs in the source database.
  - Do not run DDL operations of changing the database/table structure during database/table structure migration or full migration.
  - Do not delete the system table `__tencentdb__` during incremental migration. 
- If you only perform full data migration, do not write new data into the source database during migration; otherwise, the data in the source and target databases will be inconsistent. In scenarios with data writes, to ensure the data consistency in real time, we recommend you select full + incremental data migration.

## Supported SQL Operations
| Operation Type | Supported SQL Operations                                              |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| DML      | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and REPLACE                              |
| DDL      | TABLE: CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE TABLE, and RENAME TABLE <br>VIEW: CREATE VIEW and DROP VIEW<br>INDEX: CREATE INDEX and DROP INDEX <br>DATABASE: CREATE DATABASE, ALTER DATABASE, and DROP DATABASE |

## Environment Requirements
>?The system will automatically check the following environment requirements before starting a migration task and report an error if a requirement is not met. If you can identify the failed check item, fix it as instructed in [Requirements for Check Items](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552); otherwise, wait for the system verification to complete and fix the problem according to the error message.

<tr>
<td>Requirements for source database</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>The source and target databases can be connected.</li>
<li>The server where the source database resides has enough outbound bandwidth; otherwise, the migration speed will be affected.</li>

<li>The `binlog_row_image` variable in the source database must be set to `FULL`.</li>
<li>On MySQL 5.6 or above, if the `gtid_mode` variable is not `ON`, an alarm will be triggered. We recommend you enable `gtid_mode`.</li>
<li>You cannot set filter conditions with `do_db` and `ignore_db`.</li>
<li>If the source database is a slave database, the `log_slave_updates` variable must be set to `ON`.</li>

<li>Foreign key dependency:
<ul>
<li>Foreign key dependency can be set to only one of the following three types: `NO ACTION`, `RESTRICT`, and `CASCADE`.</li>
<li>During partial table migration, tables with foreign key dependency must be migrated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The migration precision of DTS for data in `FLOAT` type is 38 digits, and for data in `DOUBLE` type is 308 digits. You should check whether this meets your requirements.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr>

5. On the task verification page, verify the task. After the verification is passed, click **Start Task**.
    If the verification failed, fix the problem as instructed in [Fix for Verification Failure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42552) and initiate the verification task again.
 - Failed: it indicates that a check item failed and the task is blocked. You need to fix the problem and run the verification task again.
 - Alarm: it indicates that a check item doesn't completely meet the requirements, and the task can be continued, but the business will be affected. You need to assess whether to ignore the alarm or fix the problem and continue the task based on the alarm message.

6. Return to the data migration task list, and you can see that the task has entered the **Preparing** status. After 1â€“2 minutes, the data migration task will be started.
   - Select **Structural migration** or **Full migration**: once completed, the task will be stopped automatically.
   - Select **Full + Incremental migration**: after full migration is completed, the migration task will automatically enter the incremental data sync stage, which will not stop automatically. You need to click **Complete** to manually stop the incremental data sync.
      - Select an appropriate time to manually complete the incremental data sync and perform business switch.
      - You can see that the migration task is in the incremental sync stage, and there is no latency. Stop writing the source database for several minutes.
      - When the source-target database data gap is 0 MB, and the source-target database time lag is 0s, manually complete the incremental sync.
