## Overview
Database/Table renaming is also known as database/table mapping. In data sync scenarios, you can rename the databases/tables to be synced in order to avoid name conflicts between the source and target databases. 

## Directions
1. Log in to the [DTS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dts/migration), select **Data Sync** on the left sidebar, and create a sync task.
2. In the **Set source and target databases** step, in **Selected Object** on the right, hover over the object to be modified and click the displayed **Edit** icon.
