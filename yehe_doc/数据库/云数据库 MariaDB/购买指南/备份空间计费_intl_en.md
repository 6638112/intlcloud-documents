The backup space is used to store the backup files of all TencentDB for MariaDB instances in a region, including data backups (cold backups) and log backups (binlog backups).
>?Backup space billing will start on March 1, 2023.

## Free Backup Space
TencentDB for MariaDB offers a free backup space the same size as the storage capacity of the purchased instance by region.

**The free backup space in a region equals to the sum of single-node storage spaces of all purchased instances in the region.**

>?
>- The free backup space is offered for both primary and disaster recovery instances.
>- You can view the size of an instance's backup space on the backup page in the [TencentDB for MariaDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mariadb/backup/overview).

## Backup Billing
A certain free tier is available for the backup space, and only the excessive backup space is billed.
>?
>- Billable space of less than 1 GB is not billed, and a billable time period of less than one hour is counted as one hour.
>- You can view the size of the excessive backup space on the backup page in the [TencentDB for MariaDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mariadb/backup/overview).

| Region | Price (USD/GB/Hour) |

## Backup Lifecycle
The lifecycle of a backup is the same as that of an instance as described in [Payment Overdue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/37511).

### Monthly subscribed instance
- The backup feature can be used normally **within seven days** after an instance expires, during which backups beyond the free tier will still be billed.
- **From the eighth day** after expiration, the instance is isolated and moved into the recycle bin. At this time, automatic backup stops, and rollback and manual backup are prohibited, but backups can still be downloaded. Excessive backup space will still be billed until the instance is eliminated. You can renew the instance in the recycle bin in the console to recover it.
- **After seven days** since the instance has been isolated in the recycle bin, the instance is eliminated (i.e., deleted completely) along with all data backups. Save the needed backups in a timely manner.
>?
>- If the monthly subscribed instance has not expired but your account has overdue payments, the backup feature can still be used normally, and automatic backup continues, where excessive backup space is still billed.
>- If you need to perform rollback, manual backup, or backup download, top up your account to a positive balance.

### Pay-as-you-go instance
- Backups are subject to change over the instance lifecycle.
- Backups can work normally **within 24 hours** after the instance payment becomes overdue.
- **After 24 hours** since the instance payment has been overdue, the instance is isolated and moved into the recycle bin. At this time, automatic backup stops, and rollback and manual backup are prohibited, but backups can still be downloaded. Excessive backup space will still be billed until the instance is eliminated. You can renew the instance in the recycle bin in the console to recover it.
- **After seven days** since the instance has been isolated in the recycle bin, the instance is eliminated (i.e., deleted completely) along with all data backups. Save the needed backups in a timely manner.

## Backup Optimization
- Reduce the backup retention period: The instance retains backups of the last seven days by default, and you can manually reduce the number of backup retention days to save the backup space.
Log in to the [TencentDB for MariaDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mariadb), select **Instance Details** > **Backup and Restoration**, and adjust the backup retention period, which can be 1â€“365 days.
- Adjust the backup execution time: Specify a time (usually during off-peak hours) for backup execution, which will improve the backup efficiency. Log in to the [TencentDB for MariaDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mariadb), select **Instance Details** > **Backup and Restoration**, and adjust the backup execution time.
>?
>- Currently, TencentDB for MariaDB backups are automatic backups and cannot be manually deleted.
>- The backup retention period is seven days by default, which can basically meet the needs in most business scenarios.
