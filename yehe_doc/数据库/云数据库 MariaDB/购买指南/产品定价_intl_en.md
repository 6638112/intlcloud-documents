## Billing Formula
**Total fees = Instance fees + Backup capacity fees + Traffic fees**.
**Instance fees = Node price x Number of nodes = (Node memory x Memory price + Node disk capacity x Disk price) x Number of nodes**

>? The number of nodes is the sum of primary and replica instances. For example, 1 primary and 1 replica are 2 nodes, and 1 primary and 2 replicas are 3 nodes.

## Billing Examples 
**Monthly subscription**: suppose a user purchases 1 monthly subscription TencentDB for MariaDB with 2 nodes (1 primary and 1 replica) in the Guangzhou region for 1 month, and each node has 2 GB memory and 500 GB disk capacity.
The fees to be paid are calculated as follows:
Instance fees = (Node memory x Memory price + Node disk capacity x Disk price) x Number of nodes=(2 GB Ã— 9.43 USD/GB/month + 500 GB x 0.18 USD/GB/month) x 2 nodes x 1 month = 217.72 USD
	
**Pay-as-you-go**: suppose a user purchases 1 pay-as-you-go TencentDB for MariaDB with 2 nodes (1 primary and 1 replica) in the Beijing region for 400 hours, and each node has 2 GB memory and 500 GB disk capacity.
The fees to be paid are calculated as follows:
 - Tier 1 fee: (2 GB x 0.0262 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00025 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 96 hours = 34.061 USD
 - Tier 2 fee: (2 GB x 0.0196 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00025 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 264 hours = 86.698 USD
 - Tier 3 fee: (2 GB x 0.0131 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00025 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 40 hours = 12.096 USD
Instance fees = Tier 1 fee + Tier 2 fee + Tier 3 fee = 132.855 USD
