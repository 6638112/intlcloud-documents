TencentDB for Tendis provides a complete and easy-to-use monitoring service where you donâ€™t have to worry about, for example, collecting monitoring data or OPS of the monitoring system. The monitoring service includes Proxy monitoring, Redis monitoring, and Tendis monitoring which summarizes the monitoring data of an entire instance. Details are as follows:
- Proxy monitoring: provides monitoring information of all Proxy nodes in an instance. TencentDB for Tendis instances in standard or cluster architecture have Proxy nodes.
- Redis monitoring: provides monitoring information of TencentDB for Tendis primary and secondary nodes.
- Tendis monitoring: summarizes the monitoring data of an entire instance (including Proxy nodes and Tendis nodes) and aggregates data according to the SUM, AVG, MAX, and LAST aggregation algorithms.

## Monitoring Granularity and Monitoring Data Retention Period
Tendis currently supports monitoring metrics at the 1-minute, 5-minutes, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity. For the retention period of monitoring data at each granularity, please see [Use Limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/32803).

## Viewing Monitoring Information
You can view TencentDB for Tendis monitoring information in the instance list and on the instance monitoring page in the TencentDB for Tendis console, or in the Cloud Monitor console.
- Instance list: log in to the [TencentDB for Tendis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tendis), click the **View Monitoring** icon in the instance list as shown below, and view monitoring metrics in the pop-up window on the right.

## Monitoring Metric Description
### Proxy monitoring
Each Tendis instance contains at least 3 Proxy nodes. Generally, the number of Proxy nodes is 1.5 times that of Tendis nodes. The Proxy node supports the following monitoring metrics:
