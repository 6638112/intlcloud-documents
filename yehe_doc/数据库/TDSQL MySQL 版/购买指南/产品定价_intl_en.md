## Billing Formula
**Total fees = Instance fees + Backup capacity fees (free of charge for now) + Traffic fees (free of charge for now)**
**Instance fees = Node price x Number of nodes x Number of shards = (Node memory size x Memory price + Node disk size x Disk price) x Number of nodes x Number of shards**

>?The number of nodes is the sum of primary and secondary nodes specified in the instance specification. For example, 1-primary-1-secondary specification means 2 nodes and 1-primary-2-secondary specification 3 nodes.

## Billing Examples

**Monthly subscription**: suppose a user purchases 1 monthly-subscribed TDSQL for MySQL instance with 2 shards in the Guangzhou region for 1 month. Each shard has 2 nodes (1 primary and 1 secondary), and each node has 2 GB memory and 500 GB disk capacity.
The fees are calculated as follows:
Instance fees = (Node memory size x Memory price + Node disk size x Disk price) x Number of nodes x Number of shards = (2 GB x 9.43 USD/GB/month + 500 GB x 0.06 USD/GB/month) x 2 nodes x 2 shards x 1 month = 195.44 USD
	
**Pay-as-you-go**: suppose a user purchases 1 pay-as-you-go TDSQL for MySQL instance with 2 shards in the Beijing region for 400 hours. Each shard has 2 nodes (1 primary and 1 secondary), and each node has 2 GB memory and 500 GB disk capacity.
The fees are calculated as follows:
 - Tier 1 fees: (2 GB x 0.026194 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.000250 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 2 shards x 96 hours = 68.116992 USD
 - Tier 2 fees: (2 GB x 0.013097 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.000250 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 2 shards x 264 hours = 159.660864 USD
 - Tier 3 fees: (2 GB x 0.019646 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.000250 USD/GB/hr) x 2 nodes x 2 shards x 40 hours = 26.28672 USD
Instance fees = Tier 1 fees + Tier 2 fees + Tier 3 fees = 254.064576 USD
