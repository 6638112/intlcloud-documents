- Ineffective order amount: Refers to the amount paid for the order that will take effect in the future, excluding vouchers.
- The used resource value is calculated as follows:
 - For the used resources, if the usage has lasted at least one month as of the date of return, fees will be deducted by month; otherwise, fees will be deducted in a pay-as-you-go manner.
 - The usage is accurate down to the second.
 - If the refund is â‰¤ 0, it will be calculated as 0, and resources will be returned.

>!
>- Discounts and vouchers are not returned.
>- Order discount: The discount will be calculated and deducted for used resources at the original price, and only the remainder can be refunded.
**Refund amount = discount amount - original price * used time proportion**
>- The refund will be credited to your account at the ratio of cash to trial credit paid upon purchase.
