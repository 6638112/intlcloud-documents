## Ultra high performance
- A single shard can sustain up to 240,000 QPS, and the performance of an entire instance can be linearly improved as the number of shards increases.
- Computing/Storage resources can be independently and imperceptibly scaled, and a single instance can offer exabytes of storage capacity.
- Each node at the computing layer can be read and written, and a single instance can easily sustain tens of millions of QPS.
- Ultra high compression ratio (up to 20:1) is supported for storage, which is especially suitable for business scenarios with a high number of writes and a low number of reads.
