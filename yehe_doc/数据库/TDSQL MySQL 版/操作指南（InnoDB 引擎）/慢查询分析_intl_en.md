## Feature Description
A SQL statement query that takes more time than the specified value is referred to as a "slow query", and the corresponding statement is called a "slow query statement". The process where a database admin (DBA) analyzes slow query statements and finds out the reasons why slow queries occur is known as "slow query analysis".

Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb), click an instance ID in the instance list to enter the management page, and select the **Performance Optimization** > **Slow Query Analysis** tab to perform slow query analysis.

>- Currently, slow query analysis can only be performed and viewed in each shard separately.
>- To download slow logs, you need to copy the download address, [log in to a (Linux) CVM instance in the same VPC as the database instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/213/10517), and run the `wget` command for download over the private network.

## Main Parameters
### Main default settings
-   Slow query feature: Enabled by default.
-   Slow query threshold (long_query_time): One second by default, that is, only query statements executed for more than one second will be logged.
-   Analyzed data output delay: 1â€“5 minutes.
-   Logging duration: 30 days, depending on the backup and log settings.

### Analysis list fields
-   **Checksum** (checksum): A sequence of digits used to identify a slow query statement (64-bit by default).
-   **Abstracted SQL Statement** (fingerprint): A slow query statement with user data hidden.
-   **Database**: The database in which the slow query statement was executed.
-   **Account**: The account under which a slow query statement occurs.
-   **Last Execution Time** (last_seen): The time when the slow query statement was last executed within the specified time range.
-   **First Execution Time** (first_seen): The time when the slow query statement was first executed within the specified time range.
-   **Total** (ts_cnt): The number of executions of the slow query statement within the specified time range.
-   **Execution Proportion (%)**: The ratio of total executions of the slow query statement to the total executions of all slow query statements within the specified time range.
-   **Total Time** (query_time_sum): The total time consumed by the slow query statement within the specified time range.
-   **Total Time (%)**: The ratio in percentage of the total time consumed by the slow query statement to the total time consumed by all slow query statements within the specified time range.
-   **Average Time** (query_time_avg): The average time is calculated by dividing the total time consumed by the slow query statement by the total number of executions of the slow query statement.
-   **Min Time** (query_time_min): The minimum among all execution time of the slow query statement.
-   **Max Time** (query_time_max): The maximum among all execution time of the slow query statement.
-   **Total Lock Time** (lock_time_sum): The total lock time of the slow query statement.
-   **Total Lock Time Ratio**: The ratio in percentage of the total lock time of the slow query statement to the total lock time of all slow query statements.
-   **Average Lock Time** (lock_time_avg): The average time calculated by dividing the total lock time of the slow query statement by the total number of locks of the slow query statement.
-   **Min Lock Time** (lock_time_min): The minimum among all lock time of the slow query statement.
-   **Max Lock Time** (lock_time_max): The maximum among all lock time of the slow query statement.
-   **Sent Rows** (Rows_sent_sum): The total number of data rows sent by the slow query statement.
-   **Scanned Rows** (Rows_examined_sum): The total number of data rows scanned by the slow query statement.
-   **Host Address** (Host): The host from which this slow query comes.
-   **Monitoring**: Click to view the analysis details of the SQL statement.
-   **SQL Example**: Typical example of SQL statement.
