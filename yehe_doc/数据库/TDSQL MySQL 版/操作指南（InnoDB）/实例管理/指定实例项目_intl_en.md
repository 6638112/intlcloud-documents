This document describes how to assign an instance to different projects for management in the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql).

In Tencent Cloud, project is defined as a method for assigning resources among teams. You can use a project to assign different resources to different teams based on your organizational structure.

- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are the associated instances of the source instance and should be in the same project as the source instance.
- Assigning and reassigning TencentDB instances will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The default project will be used if you don't specify one.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql), click an instance name in the instance list to enter the instance details page, and click the ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/8bb5bec2923a6f3f32cb6e1326ad6426.png) icon after **Project**.
