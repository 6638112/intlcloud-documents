This document describes how to rename a database instance in the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql).

>?
> - Renaming an instance does not change the private IP of the database or affect database connections.
> - After the instance is renamed, its project and network remain unchanged.
> - If an instance is in another task flow (such as upgrade or initialization), it cannot be renamed.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/instance-tdmysql), locate an instance in the instance list, and click the ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/174537f0d9c45b8843d3bd631456bed8.png) icon next to its name. You can also click an instance name/ID in the instance list to access the instance details page, and click the ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/174537f0d9c45b8843d3bd631456bed8.png) icon next to the instance name in the **Basic Info** section.
2. In the pop-up window, modify the instance name and click **OK**.
