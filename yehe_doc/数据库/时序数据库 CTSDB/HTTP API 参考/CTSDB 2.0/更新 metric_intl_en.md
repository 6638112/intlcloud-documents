#### Request address and method

The address is the instance IP and port, such as `10.13.20.15:9200`, which can be obtained in the console.

#### Request parameters

None

#### Request content

The `tags`, `time`, `fields`, and `options` fields are all of the `map` type and optional. For their formats, see [Creating Metric](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/45525). The specific requirements are as detailed below:
tags: You can add tag fields and modify the types of existing tag fields without deleting existing fields.
time: You cannot modify `name` but can modify `format`.
fields: You can add metric fields and modify the types of existing metric fields without deleting existing fields.
`options` attributes are as detailed below:

| Attribute            | Required | Type    | Description                                                         |
| :------------------ | :--- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| expire_day          | No   | integer | Data expiration time, which is a non-zero integer. Once expired, the data will be automatically cleared. By default, data never expires |
| refresh_interval    | No   | string  | Data refresh interval, which is 10 seconds by default. The written data can be queried after being refreshed from the memory to disk |
| number_of_shards    | No   | integer | Number of metric shards, which is a positive integer and 3 by default. This parameter can be ignored for small metrics. A large metric can be divided into shards, and each shard can be up to 25 GB in size |
| number_of_replicas  | No   | integer | Number of replicas, which is a non-negative integer; for example, 1 indicates one master and one replica. The default value is 1         |
| rolling_period      | No   | integer | Child metric period (in days), which is a non-zero integer. When CTSDB stores data, to facilitate data expiration and improve query efficiency, it stores data into child metrics by the specified time interval, which is subject to the data expiration time by default |
| max_string_length   | No   | integer | Maximum length of a custom string, which is a positive integer. Its maximum value is 2^31 - 1, and its default value is 256 |
| default_date_format | No   | string  | Format of the `date` data type of custom tags and fields, which is `strict_date_optional_time` or `epoch_millis` by default |
| indexed_fields      | No   | array   | Fields whose indexes need to be retained in the fields. You can use an array to specify multiple fields   |
| default_type        | No   | string  | Default type of new fields. Its valid values are `tag` and `field`, and its default value is `tag` |

> Note:

>
> - As the historical data cannot be modified, after fields are updated, the metric information will not immediately change until the next [child metric](hyperlink) is generated. If you want to confirm whether the update is successful, you can call the `GET /_metric/${metric_name}?v` API.
> - Only fields of the `short`, `integer`, `float` data types can be changed to another type. The `short` type can be changed to the `integer` or `long` type, `integer` to `long`, and `float` to `double`.

#### Response content

You need to judge whether a request is successful based on the `error` field. If the response content contains the `error` field, the request failed. For the error details, see the `error` field description.
