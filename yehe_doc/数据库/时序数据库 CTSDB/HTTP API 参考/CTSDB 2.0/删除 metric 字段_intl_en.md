>!
> As historical data cannot be modified, after fields are deleted, the metric information will not change until the next [child metric](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/45525) is generated. If you want to check whether the deletion is successful, you can call the `GET /_metric/${metric_name}?v` API.

### Response content

You need to judge whether a request is successful based on the `error` field. If the response content contains the `error` field, the request failed. For the error details, see the `error` field description.
