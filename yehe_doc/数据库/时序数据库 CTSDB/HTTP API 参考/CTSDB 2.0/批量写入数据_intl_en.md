## Bulk writing data into single metric

This API can be used to write data records into a single metric either in bulk or not. To improve the write efficiency, we recommend you write data in bulk.

### Request address

The address is the instance IP and port, such as `10.13.20.15:9200`, which can be obtained in the console.

### Request path and method

Request path: `/${metric_name}/_doc/_bulk`, where `${metric_name}` is the metric name.
Method: POST


>!
> The `_doc` keyword is the `_type` of the written data and must be added to facilitate subsequent system parsing and upgrade.

### Request parameters

You can set the `filter_path` parameter to filter and simplify the returned results. For more information, see [Bulk Querying Data](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/45519).

### Request content

You need to bulk write data as structured data in NDJSON format into a metric, which is similar to the following:

```
Metadata\n
Data to be written\n
....
Metadata\n
Data to be written\n
```

The format of the metadata is as shown below:

```
{ 
"index" : 
{ 
"_id" : "1",                # Document ID (optional)
}
}
```

The format of the written data is as shown below:

```
{ 
"field1" : "value1",
"field2" : "value2"
}
```

### Response content

You should note that the returned result of the bulk data write API is different from those of other APIs. Pay attention to the `errors` (not `error`) field in the JSON result first. If it is `false`, all data records were successfully written; if it is `true`, some data records failed to be written, and you can get the failure details from the `items` field.
The `items` field is an array, where each element corresponds to a write request. You can check whether each element has the `error` field to judge whether the corresponding request is successful. If the `error` field exists, the request failed. The specific error information is in the `error` field. If the `error` field doesn't exist, the request succeeded.

> The `errors` value returned above is `false`, indicating that all data records were successfully written. The `items` array indicates the write result of each record in the same order as in the `bulk` request. For single records in `items`, the `status` of `2XX` indicates that the record was successfully written. `_index` indicates the [child metric](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/45525) where the data was written, and `_shards` indicates the replica write status. In the above sample, `total` indicates two replicas, and `successful` indicates that data was successfully written into both replicas.

## Bulk writing data into multiple metrics

This API can be used to write data records into multiple metrics either in bulk or not. To improve the write efficiency, we recommend you write data in bulk.

### Request address

The address is the instance IP and port, such as `10.13.20.15:9200`, which can be obtained in the console.

### Request path and method

Request path: `_bulk`
Method: PUT

### Request parameters

You can set the `filter_path` parameter to filter and simplify the returned results. For more information, see [Bulk Querying Data](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/45519).

### Request content

You need to bulk write data as structured data in NDJSON format into a metric, which is similar to the following:

```
Metadata\n
Data to be written\n
....
Metadata\n
Data to be written\n
```

The format of the metadata is as shown below:

```
{ 
"index" : 
{ 
    "_index" :"metric_name",    # Metric where data is to be written
    "_id" : "1",                # Document ID (optional)
}
}
```

The format of the written data is as shown below:

```
{ 
"field1" : "value1",
"field2" : "value2"
}
```

### Response content

You need to judge whether a request is successful based on the `error` field. If the response content contains the `error` field, the request failed. The specific error information is in the `error` field. Note: if the request succeeded but the `errors` (not `error`) field is not `false`, the specific data that failed to be written is indicated in the `errors` field.
