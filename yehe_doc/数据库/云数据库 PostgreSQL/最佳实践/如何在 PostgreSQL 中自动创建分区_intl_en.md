In earlier versions of PostgreSQL, the table partitioning feature can be supported through inheritance; for example, a table partition can be created monthly by time, and data can be recorded in particular partitions. PostgreSQL 10 and later support declarative partitioning. This document describes how to create partitions in advance or in real time based on the written data.

The following are several common schemes for PostgreSQL to automatically create partitioned tables.

## Use Cases
In practical use cases of partitioned tables, the time field is generally used as the partition key; for example, if the partition field type is timestamp, the partitioning method can be "list of values".
The table structure is as follows:
```
CREATE TABLE tab
(
    id   bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    ts   timestamp NOT NULL,
    data text
) PARTITION BY LIST ((ts::date));
CREATE TABLE tab_def PARTITION OF tab DEFAULT;
```

**Partition creation is generally divided into the following two scenarios:**
### 1. Scheduled partition creation
You can create partitions in advance with the help of a task scheduling tool. Common tools and partition creation methods are as follows:

#### Using system schedulers such as Crontab (Linux, Unix, etc.) and Task Scheduler (Windows)
Taking Linux as an example, create a partitioned table at 14:00 every day for the next day:
```
cat > /tmp/create_part.sh <<EOF
dateStr=\$(date -d '+1 days' +%Y%m%d); 
psql -c "CREATE TABLE tab_\$dateStr (LIKE tab INCLUDING INDEXES); ALTER TABLE tab ATTACH PARTITION tab_\$dateStr FOR VALUES IN ('\$dateStr')";
EOF
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "0 14 * * * bash /tmp/create_part.sh ") | crontab -
```

#### Using built-in schedulers such as pg_cron and pg_timetable
Taking pg_cron as an example, create a partitioned table at 14:00 every day for the next day:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_tab_part() RETURNS integer
    LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
DECLARE
    dateStr varchar;
BEGIN
    SELECT to_char(DATE 'tomorrow', 'YYYYMMDD') INTO dateStr;
    EXECUTE
        format('CREATE TABLE tab_%s (LIKE tab INCLUDING INDEXES)', dateStr);
    EXECUTE
        format('ALTER TABLE tab ATTACH PARTITION tab_%s FOR VALUES IN (%L)', dateStr, dateStr);
    RETURN 1;
END;
$$;

CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;

SELECT cron.schedule('0 14 * * *', $$SELECT create_tab_part();$$);
```

#### Using dedicated partition management extensions such as pg_partman
Taking pg_partman as an example, create a partitioned table every day for the next day:
```
CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman;

SELECT partman.create_parent(p_parent_table => 'public.tab',
                             p_control => 'ts',
                             p_type => 'native',
                             p_interval=> 'daily',
                             p_premake => 1);
```

### 2. On-demand real-time partition creation
If you want to create partitions according to the need of data insertion, so you can determine whether there is data in a time range based on whether a partition exists, this generally can be implemented with triggers.

**Note that there are two problems with this method:**
- Only PostgreSQL 13 and later provide BEFORE/FOR EACH ROW triggers for partitioned tables.
```
ERROR:  "tab" is a partitioned table
DETAIL:  Partitioned tables cannot have BEFORE / FOR EACH ROW triggers.
```
- When data is inserted, the partitioned table definition cannot be modified due to the table lock; that is, child tables cannot be attached. Therefore, another connection must be used to perform the ATTACH operation. Here, the LISTEN/NOTIFY mechanism can be used to ask another connection to modify the partition definition.
```
ERROR:  cannot CREATE TABLE .. PARTITION OF "tab"
        because it is being used by active queries in this session
Or
ERROR:  cannot ALTER TABLE "tab"
        because it is being used by active queries in this session
```

**Trigger (implementing child table creation and NOTIFY)**
```
CREATE FUNCTION part_trig() RETURNS trigger
    LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        /* try to create a table for the new partition */
        EXECUTE
            format('CREATE TABLE %I (LIKE tab INCLUDING INDEXES)', 'tab_' || to_char(NEW.ts, 'YYYYMMDD'));

        /*
         * tell listener to attach the partition
         * (only if a new table was created)
         */
        EXECUTE
            format('NOTIFY tab, %L', to_char(NEW.ts, 'YYYYMMDD'));
    EXCEPTION
        WHEN duplicate_table THEN
            NULL; -- ignore
    END;

    /* insert into the new partition */
    EXECUTE
        format('INSERT INTO %I VALUES ($1.*)', 'tab_' || to_char(NEW.ts, 'YYYYMMDD'))
        USING NEW;

    /* skip insert into the partitioned table */
    RETURN NULL;
END;
$$;

CREATE TRIGGER part_trig
    BEFORE INSERT
    ON TAB
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN (pg_trigger_depth() < 1)
EXECUTE FUNCTION part_trig();
Code (implementing LISTEN and ATTACH for child tables)
#!/usr/bin/env python3.9
# encoding:utf8
import asyncio

import psycopg2
from psycopg2.extensions import ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT

conn = psycopg2.connect('application_name=listener')
conn.set_isolation_level(ISOLATION_LEVEL_AUTOCOMMIT)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(f'LISTEN tab;')


def attach_partition(table, date):
    with conn.cursor() as cs:
        cs.execute('ALTER TABLE "%s" ATTACH PARTITION "%s_%s" FOR VALUES IN (\'%s\')' % (table, table, date, date))


def handle_notify():
    conn.poll()
    for notify in conn.notifies:
        print(notify.payload)
        attach_partition(notify.channel, notify.payload)
    conn.notifies.clear()

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
loop.add_reader(conn, handle_notify)
loop.run_forever()
```

## Summary
This document describes two schemes for automatic partition creation as summarized below:
- The solutions in the **scheduled partition creation** scenario are simple and easy to understand, but they depend on the schedule management mechanism of the system or extension and incur additional management costs during Ops and migration.
- In the **on-demand real-time partition creation** scenario, the number of unnecessary partitions can be reduced according to the actual data pattern, but a later version (â‰¥13) and an additional connection are required, making the scheme more complicated.

You can choose an appropriate automatic partition creation method according to your business conditions.

| Scenario | Version | Implementation | Need of System Scheduler or Extension | Need of Additional Connection Mechanism | Cost |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Scheduled partition creation | PostgreSQL 10 | Easy | Yes | No | High |
| On-demand real-time partition creation | PostgreSQL 13 or later | Complicated | No | Yes | Low |
