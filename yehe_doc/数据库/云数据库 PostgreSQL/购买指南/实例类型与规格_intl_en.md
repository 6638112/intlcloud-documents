A TencentDB instance is a standalone database environment running in Tencent Cloud. It includes multiple databases created by users and can be accessed using the same tools and applications as those for a standalone database instance.

## Instance Types
TencentDB for PostgreSQL supports the following types of instances:
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Instance Type</th><th width="20%">Definition</th><th width="15%">Architecture</th><th>Visible in the Instance List</th><th>Feature</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Primary instance</td>
<td>An instance that can be read from and written to</td>
<td>High-Availability edition</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>A primary instance can mount read-only instances for read/write separation</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Read-Only instance</td>
<td>An instance that can only be read from</td>
<td>Single-Node read-only</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>A read-only instance cannot exist on its own. Instead, it must be affiliated to a primary instance. Its data comes solely from syncing with the primary instance, and it must reside in the same region as the primary instance. By default, you can create up to seven read-only instances for a primary instance. To create more than seven read-only instances, please <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a>.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

### Reference
