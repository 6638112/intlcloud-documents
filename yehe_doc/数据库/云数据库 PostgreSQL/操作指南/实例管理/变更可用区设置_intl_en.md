This document describes how to modify the primary and standby AZs of an instance in the TencentDB for PostgreSQL console. Modifying AZs has no impact on the instanceâ€™s properties, configurations, or connection addresses. The amount of time required to modify AZs depends on the data volume of the instance.

## Background
- Compared with a single-AZ deployment scheme, a multi-AZ one has better disaster recovery capabilities and can protect your database from being affected by database instance failures, AZ outages, and even IDC-level failures.
- The multi-AZ deployment scheme guarantees the high availability and failover capability of database instances by combining multiple AZs in the same region into a single "multi-AZ".

## Notes
- The region where your instance resides should have at least two AZs.
- The target AZ has sufficient computing resources.
- Because a read-only instance has only one node, it cannot use the multi-AZ deployment scheme. The region where the read-only instance resides will not change if the AZs of its primary instance change.

## Costs
There is no additional charge for the time being.

## Directions
### Selecting AZs on the instance purchase page
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres) and click **Create**.
2. On the displayed purchase page, select a region, **Primary AZ**, and **Standby AZ**.

3. After the instance is purchased, you can view its primary and standby AZs in the **Availability Info** block on the **Instance Details** tab.

### Modifying AZs in the console
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres). In the instance list, select a region and click an instance ID to access the instance management page.
2. Click **Modify AZ** in the **Availability Info** block on the **Instance Details** tab.

3. In the pop-up **Modify Deployment Info** window, select AZs for the primary node and the standby node, respectively.
>!The default data replication mode is synchronous replication, which prioritizes data integrity. The instance performance is affected by the log transmission efficiency.
4. Select the switch time and click **OK**.
 - Specify time: The switch will occur during the period of time you select.
 - Upon modification completion: The switch will occur right after the modification is completed.
>?Modifying the primary AZ of an instance will trigger an instance switch, during which the database will be temporarily disconnected. Make sure that your business has a reconnection mechanism. However, modifying the standby AZ has no impact on instance access.
>
5. After the instance status changes from **Modifying AZ** to **Running**, the AZ modification is completed.
