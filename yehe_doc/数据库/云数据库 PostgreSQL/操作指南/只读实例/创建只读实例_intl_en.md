TencentDB for PostgreSQL allows you to create one or more read-only replicas, which is suitable for read/write separation and one-primary-multiple-secondary application scenarios and capable of greatly enhancing the read load capacity of your databases.

Unified read/write separation addresses (i.e., read and write requests are separated automatically) are not supported currently. You can access read-only replicas with separate IPs and ports, or add them to a read-only replica group (RO group) to balance their loads.

>?For more information on read-only replica fees, please see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/409/4993). Currently, read-only replicas do not support monthly subscription.

#### Concepts
- Read-only replica group (RO group): it consists of one or more load balancing-enabled read-only replicas. If there are multiple read-only replicas in one RO group, read requests can be evenly distributed among the replicas. RO groups provide IPs and ports for access to databases.
- Read-only replica: it is a single-node (without a secondary node) instance that supports read requests. A read-only replica cannot exist independently; instead, it must belong to a primary instance.

#### Architecture
Read-only replicas adopt PostgreSQL streaming replication, which can sync the changes in the primary instance to all read-only replicas. Given the single-node architecture (without a secondary node) of read-only replicas, repeated attempts to restore a failing read-only replica will be made. Therefore, we recommend that you use an RO group to manage read-only replicas for higher availability.

## Feature Limits
- The minimum disk capacity for a read-only replica must be greater than or equal to the storage capacity used by the primary instance.
- Up to six read-only replicas can be created for a primary instance.
- Backup and rollback features are not supported.
- Data cannot be migrated to read-only replicas.
- Databases can be neither created in nor deleted from read-only replicas.
- Operations including account creation/deletion/authorization and account name/password modification are not supported.

## Notes
- There is no need to maintain accounts or databases for read-only replicas, which are synchronized with those of the primary instance.
- Data inconsistency between multiple read-only replicas may occur due to the delay in data sync between the read-only replicas and the primary instance. You can check the delay in the console.
- The specification of a read-only replica can be different from that of the primary instance, which makes it easier for you to upgrade the read-only replica according to the load. We recommend you keep the same specifications of read-only replicas in one RO group.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres). In the instance list, click the instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to access the instance management page.
2. Click **Add Read-only Replica** in the **Instance Architecture Diagram** section on the **Instance Details** tab or click **Create** on the **Read-only Replica** tab.

3. On the displayed purchase page, specify the following read-only replica configurations, confirm that everything is correct, and click **Buy Now**.
 - **Specify RO Group**: create an RO group, specify an existing RO group, or do not specify any RO group for the time being.
    - **Create RO Group**: if multiple read-only replicas are purchased at a time, all of them will be assigned to the newly created RO group. The RO group automatically allocates read weights to each read-only replica, and automatically distributes read requests among the read-only replicas based on their read weights. For more information, please see [Creating RO Groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/409/39546).
    - **Existing RO Group**: specify an existing RO group. If multiple read-only replicas are purchased at a time, all of them will be assigned to the RO group.
 - **Remove Read-only Replicas Exceeding the Delay Threshold**: remove a read-only replica from the RO group if the data sync log size difference between the primary instance and the read-only replica is greater than the specified threshold (MB).
 - **AZ**: You can select all AZs in the same region as the primary instance. 
4. After the purchase is completed, you will be redirected to the instance list. After the status of the read-only replica is displayed as **Running**, it can be used normally.
