Row and array comparisons support the following expressions: `IN`, `NOT IN`, `ANY/SOME(array)`, `ALL(array)`, row constructor comparison, and composite type comparison.
All of these expressions return Boolean results. Their specific descriptions and operations are similar to those as described in the previous section. For more information, please see [Row and Array Comparisons](http://www.postgres.cn/docs/10/functions-comparisons.html).
