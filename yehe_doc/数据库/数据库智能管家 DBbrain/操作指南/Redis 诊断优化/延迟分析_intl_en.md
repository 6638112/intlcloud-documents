The Redis latency analysis feature helps you understand the database latency in real time. Through latency analysis, you can quickly view the total requests, CPU usage, and history of the current instance and locate time-consuming commands, time-consuming command execution time, overall latency distribution, and access command hits.

## Viewing the latency analysis result
1. Log in to the [DBbrain console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain) and select **Performance Optimization** on the left sidebar. On the displayed page, select a database type and an instance at the top, and select the **Latency Analysis** tab.
2. On the **Latency Analysis** tab, you can view real-time/historical latency analysis and latency details.
   - Real-time/Historical analysis
- Latency and latency distribution
   The **Latency Distribution** section displays the percentages of different latency durations, giving you a quick overview of your overall business latency.
- Time-consuming commands and number of hits
