>?Currently, database inspection is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding basic single-node instances), TDSQL-C for MySQL, self-built MySQL, TencentDB for Redis, and TencentDB for MongoDB.

Log in to the [DBbrain console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/patrol), select **Monitoring and Alarming** > **Database Inspection** on the left sidebar, and select a database type at the top.
