According to the security requirements of Tencent Cloud, APIs that are directly accessed now require CAM authentication for access starting from April 28, 2022 (originally scheduled for April 8, 2022). You should grant access permissions for the following APIs in the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy) before April 28, 2022 so that you can use them normally.

> ? In the first announcement on March 31, 2022, the scheduled authentication switch date was April 8, 2022. In order to allow you sufficient time to get prepared, the deadline is hereby extended to April 28, 2022. 

## Notes
- If you already use DBbrain's full read-write access policy (QcloudDBBRAINFullAccess), you don't need to perform this authorization.
- If you have already authorized, the authentication switch will have no impact on your business; otherwise, you should authorize first before calling APIs.
