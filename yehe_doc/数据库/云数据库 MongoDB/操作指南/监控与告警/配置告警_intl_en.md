## Overview
TencentDB for MongoDB monitoring provides multi-dimensional custom alarm features which will send alarms via SMS when metric data exceeds certain thresholds.

## Directions
### Creating an alarm policy
1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitor](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview) console and select **Alarm Configuration** > **Alarm Policy** on the left sidebar.
2. On the **Alarm Policy** page, click **Create**.
3. On the **Create Alarm Policy** page, set the policy name, policy type, alarm object, and trigger condition, etc., and click **Complete**.


### Associating alarm objects
After the alarm policy is created, you can associate alarm objects with it. When an alarm object satisfies an alarm trigger condition, an alarm notification will be sent.
1. In the [alarm policy](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/alarm2/policy) list, click the name of an alarm policy to enter the alarm policy management page.
2. Click **Add Object** in the **Alarm Object** section.
