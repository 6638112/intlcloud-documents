TencentDB for MongoDB allows you to adjust the instance maintenance time in the console to meet the changes in your business requirements.

## Overview
Maintenance time is a very important concept for TencentDB for MongoDB. To ensure the stability of your TencentDB for MongoDB instance, the backend system performs maintenance operations on the instance during the maintenance time. We highly recommend you set an acceptable maintenance time for your business instance, usually during off-peak hours, so as to minimize the potential impact on your business.

In addition, we also recommend you perform operations involving data migration, such as adjusting the memory specification or AZ of mongod or mongos nodes, during the maintenance time. Taking the database instance AZ change as an example, as the full and incremental data needs to be synced to from the original AZ to the new AZ, data migration will be involved. After the AZ is changed, a momentary disconnection from the database may occur. When the task is initiated, the **Switch Time** can be selected as **During maintenance time**, so that the instance data migration will be started during the next **maintenance time** after the data sync is completed.
