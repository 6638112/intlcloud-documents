## Overview

If the configuration of your purchased TencentDB for MongoDB instance isn't suitable for (either below or above) your current business requirements, you can quickly adjust its specifications according to your actual business conditions (at the initial stage, at the rapid development stage, during peak hours, or during off-peak hours), so as to better meet your needs such as full utilization of resources and real-time cost optimization.

Instance configuration modification includes adjusting the instance's computing specification, storage capacity, and number of nodes. Sharded clusters also support adjusting the number of shards and the number of nodes per shard. Before adjusting the configuration, understand the [product specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/31183) supported by TencentDB first, so you can choose the most appropriate specifications for your business. 

## Version Requirement

- Currently, TencentDB for MongoDB 4.2, 4.0, 3.6, and 3.2 support adjusting the instance memory and capacity specifications.
- TencentDB for MongoDB 4.2 replica set instances don't support adjusting the number of instance nodes.
- TencentDB for MongoDB 4.2 sharded instances don't support adjusting the number of nodes per shard and the number of shards.
- TencentDB for MongoDB 3.2 sharded instances don't support adjusting the number of shards.

## Billing Description

After the instance configuration is adjusted, the instance will be billed by the new configuration. Make sure that your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient. For more information, see [Configuration Adjustment Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/44174).

## Prerequisites

- You have [applied for a TencentDB for MongoDB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/3551).
- If your instance is pay-as-you-go, make sure that your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient.
- The instance and its associated instances are in **Running** status and are not executing any tasks.

## Adjust Computing Specification and Storage Capacity
>?
>- Instance memory and capacity adjustment involves adding the nodes with selected configurations to the cluster for data sync, during which the service is not affected. After data sync is completed, the old nodes will be removed, and a new primary node will be elected. A momentary disconnection for around 10s will occur with the instance service during election. We recommend you include disaster recovery in your business code and perform the adjustment during off-peak hours.
>- During adjustment, there may be one or two momentary disconnections for around 10s each. We recommend you configure an automatic reconnection feature for your application.
>- During adjustment, if you set the write concern level to `write majority`, there may be a short request delay; therefore, set an appropriate business timeout period.
>- The name, private network address, and port of the instance remain unchanged after configuration adjustment.
>- A started configuration adjustment task cannot be canceled.

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb).
2. In the **MongoDB** drop-down list on the left sidebar, select **Replica Set Instance** or **Sharded Instance**.
   The directions for replica set instances and sharded instances are similar.
3. Above the instance list on the right, select the region.
4. In the instance list, find the target instance.
5. In the **Operation** column of the target instance, select **Adjust Configuration** in the **Adjust Configuration** drop-down list.
6. On the **Adjust Configuration** page, you can adjust the node memory, node capacity, and oplog capacity as shown below (with sharded instance as an example):
