TencentDB for MongoDB supports auth-free access to instances. You can enable it for quick connection and access to databases.

## Background
Auth-free access enables you to efficiently and quickly access database instances but brings security risks. Therefore, enable this feature with caution.

## Version Description
Currently, only TencentDB for MongoDB 3.6 and 4.0 support auth-free access.

## Notes
- Upgrade to support auth-free access involves kernel upgrade and momentary disconnections.
- After auth-free access is enabled, the instance will restart. Therefore, enable this feature during off-peak hours.

## Prerequisites
- You have [applied for a TencentDB for MongoDB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/3551).
- The TencentDB for MongoDB instance is in **Running** status.
- The TencentDB for MongoDB instance is a replica set or sharded instance on 3.6 or 4.0.

## Directions

4. In the instance list, find the target instance.
5. Click the target instance ID to enter the **Instance Details** page.
