## Overview

You can configure alarm rules for monitoring metrics to prevent your system operations from being disrupted when these metrics reach a certain value. When monitoring data meets the configured conditions, the system can check it automatically and send alarm notifications to the admin. This allows you to stay on top of business exceptions and solve them quickly.

## Billing

- CM allows you to configure alarm policies to monitor the key metrics of instances and offers a free trial.
- Currently, only **alarm SMS messages and phone calls** are charged. For more information, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/18728).

## Prerequisites

- You have activated [CM](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview).
- The database instance is in **Running** status.
- You have collected the information of the recipients of alarm notifications, such as email address and phone number.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb).
2. In the **MongoDB** drop-down list on the left sidebar, select **Replica Set Instance** or **Sharded Cluster Instance**. The directions for the two types of instances are similar.
3. Above the instance list on the right, select the region.
4. In the instance list, find the target instance.
5. In the row of the target instance, enter the **Create Policy** page of CM in any of the following ways:
   - Click ![img](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/8e01de7cd5dd07c6d2626aaba4c2288c.png) in the **Monitoring/Status** column and click **Configure Alarms** in the top-right corner of the instance monitoring dashboard.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/22a4fbb65945da3376dbc7c1e1da97af.png)
   - Click the instance ID in blue to enter the **Instance Details** page. Then, select the **System Monitoring** tab and click **Configure Alarms**.

6. On the **Create Policy** page, configure the policy as shown below. For more information on the basic concepts of alarm policy, see [Creating Alarm Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38916).

If you select <strong>Configure manually</strong>, you need to configure the threshold for triggering an alarm for each metric in the <strong>Metric Alarm</strong> section below.</li>
<li><strong>Threshold Type</strong> in the <strong>Metric Alarm</strong> section: If you select **Static**, you can manually set a fixed threshold, and alarms will be triggered when the threshold is reached. If you select <strong>Dynamic</strong>, exceptions will be determined based on the dynamic threshold boundaries calculated by machine learning algorithms. </li>For more information, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38916">Creating Alarm Policy</a>.</ul></td>

<tr>
<td>Alarm Notification</td>
<td>You can select a preset or custom notification template. Each alarm policy can be bound to three notification templates at most.</td>
