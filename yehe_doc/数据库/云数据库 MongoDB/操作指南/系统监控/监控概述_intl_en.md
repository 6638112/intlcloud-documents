The monitoring feature provided by TencentDB for MongoDB allows you to view the real-time monitoring metric data of instance resources. It collects the monitoring statistics in various forms such as visual chart, table, and dashboard. In addition, it supports setting alarms and pushing alarm notifications promptly, so that you can stay up to date with database service exceptions and adjust your business in time to guarantee stable business operations.

## Monitoring Granularity
TencentDB for MongoDB currently doesn't allow you to customize the monitoring data collection granularity. The adaptive policy is as follows:

| Time Span | Monitoring Granularity | Retention Period |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0–1 day | 5 seconds | 1 day |
| 0–1 day  | 1 minute    | 15 days     |
| 0–1 day  | 5 minutes    | 31 days     |
| 0–7 days | 1 hour | 93 days |
| 7–30 days | 1 day | 186 days |

## Types of Instances for Monitoring
TencentDB for MongoDB primary, read-only, and disaster recovery instances can be monitored, and each instance is provided with a separate monitoring view for easy query.

## Monitoring Metrics
Cloud Monitor provides the following monitoring metrics for TencentDB for MongoDB instances:
