Terminated instances will be put into the recycle bin and can be restored.

## Background
Tencent Cloud recycle bin offers a mechanism for repossessing cloud services. If your account balance is sufficient, you can restore terminated instances that are still in the recycle bin.

## Version Requirement
Currently, TencentDB for MongoDB 4.2, 4.0, 3.6, and 3.2 support instance repossession.

## Notes
For pay-as-you-go instances in the recycle bin:

- **Retention period:** If your account has no overdue payments, terminated instances will be retained in the recycle bin for three days.
- **Expiration processing**: Instances that are not renewed before the retention period ends will be released and cannot be restored.
>! 
>- After the account balance becomes 0, instances will be automatically shut down and moved from the instance list to the recycle bin, and the billing will stop in 24 hours.
>- You cannot restore pay-as-you-go instances from the recycle bin if your account has overdue payments. You need to top up your account first.
>- Pay-as-you-go instances are retained in the recycle bin for a maximum of three days. You need to top up your account in time to restore the instances.
