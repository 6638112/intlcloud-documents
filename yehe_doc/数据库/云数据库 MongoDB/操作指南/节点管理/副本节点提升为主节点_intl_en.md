## Overview

A TencentDB for MongoDB replica set instance can have one primary node and multiple replica nodes. If you find that the primary node is abnormal, you can actively promote a replica node to primary node to ensure normal business operations. In a sharded cluster instance, all shard nodes are grouped into one primary node group, and all replica nodes are grouped into multiple secondary node groups. If some shard nodes in the primary node group are abnormal, you can actively promote all nodes in a secondary node group to the primary node group.

## Version requirements

TencentDB for MongoDB 4.2, 4.0, and 3.6 support promoting replica node to primary node.

## Notes

When a node is promoted to primary node, existing TCP connections to the database will be closed. Therefore, before performing this operation, make sure that your business has an automatic reconnection mechanism; otherwise, you need to manually reconnect to the database.

## Prerequisites

The instance is in **Running** status.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb).
2. In the **MongoDB** drop-down list on the left sidebar, select **Replica Set Instance** or **Sharded Cluster Instance**. The directions for the two types of instances are similar.
3. Above the **Instance List** on the right, select the region.
4. In the **Instance List**, find the target instance.
5. Click the **Instance ID** to enter the **Instance Details** page and click the **Node Management** tab.
6. On the **Mongod Node** tab on the **Node Management** tab, find the target secondary node in the node list.
   - Replica set instance: In the node list, find the target secondary node and click **Promote to Primary Node** in the **Operation** column.

   - Sharded cluster instance: In the node list, find the target secondary node group and click **Promote to Primary Node** in the top-right corner.

7. In the **Promote to Primary Node** window, select **Confirm the risk of the promotion to primary node** and click **OK**.

8. Return to the **Instance Details** page, you can see that **Instance Status** is **Promoting to Primary Node**. After this status disappears, the task is completed. On the **Node Management** tab, you can see that the **Role** of the original secondary node becomes **PRIMARY**.
