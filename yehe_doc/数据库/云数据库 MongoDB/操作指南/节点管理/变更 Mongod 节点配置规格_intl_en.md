## Overview

If the configuration of your purchased TencentDB for MongoDB instance isn't suitable for (either below or above) your current business requirements, you can quickly adjust its specifications based on your actual business conditions (at the initial stage, at the rapid development stage, during peak hours, or during off-peak hours), so as to better meet your needs such as full utilization of resources and real-time cost optimization.

The configuration modification of mongod nodes includes adjusting the mongod computing specification and disk capacity. Before adjusting the configuration, understand the [product specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/31183) supported by TencentDB first, so you can choose the most appropriate specifications for your business. 

## Billing

After the instance configuration is adjusted, the instance will be billed by the new configuration. Make sure that your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient. For more information, see [Configuration Adjustment Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/44174).

## Prerequisites

- You have [created a TencentDB for MongoDB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/3551).
- If your instance is pay-as-you-go, make sure that your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient.
- The instance and its associated instances are in **Running** status and are not executing any tasks.

## Notes
- Instance memory and capacity adjustment involves adding the nodes with selected configurations to the cluster for data sync, during which the service is not affected. After data sync is completed, the old nodes will be removed, and a new primary node will be elected. A momentary disconnection for around 10s will occur with the instance service during election. We recommend you include disaster recovery in your business code and perform the adjustment during off-peak hours.
- During adjustment, there may be one or two momentary disconnections for around 10s each. We recommend you configure an automatic reconnection feature for your application.
- During adjustment, if you set the write concern level to `write majority`, there may be a short request delay; therefore, set an appropriate business timeout period.
- The name, private network address, and port of the instance remain unchanged after configuration adjustment.
- A started configuration adjustment task cannot be canceled.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb).
2. In the **MongoDB** drop-down list on the left sidebar, select **Replica Set Instance** or **Sharded Cluster Instance**. The directions for the two types of instances are similar.
3. Above the instance list on the right, select the region.
4. In the instance list, find the target instance.
5. In the **Operation** column of the target instance, select **Adjust Configuration** in the **Adjust Configuration** drop-down list.
6. On the **Adjust Configuration** page, you can adjust the node memory, total disk capacity, and oplog capacity (with sharded instance as an example):

<td>Node Memory/Total Capacity</td>

<td>We recommend you also adjust the oplog capacity on the slider: <ul><li>The oplog capacity is at least 10% of the instance capacity. </li><li>If the oplog is too small, it is easy to be cleaned up, and rollback will be further affected. </li><li>When the instance is downgraded, the oplog is initialized to 10% of the new storage specification. The first write time of the oplog will be overwritten after the last backup is successfully executed. To prevent rollback from being affected in this case, manually back up before the downgrade.</li></ul></td>
