## Overview
When your business has a massive number of read requests, it may be difficult for the primary and secondary database nodes to process such requests, causing a high latency, slow response, and severely dropped throughput of business requests. TencentDB for MongoDB provides read-only nodes with an independent connection address. They can sync data from a primary or secondary node with the lowest latency through oplog. You can create one or multiple read-only nodes to implement read/write separation and relieve the access pressure on the primary and secondary nodes.

Two or more nodes can implement load balancing for read requests and guarantee a high availability; that is, when a read-only node fails, the system will automatically switch it with a hidden node. If automatic switch isn't performed, you can switch the node by your own on the **Node Management** tab, and the connection address to the node will remain unchanged. You can directly get the connection string in the **Network** section on the **Instance Details** page.

If a read-only node isn't in the candidate list of the primary node, it won't be elected as the primary node or participate in the election.

## Version requirements
TencentDB for MongoDB 4.0, 4.2 and 4.4 support adding read-only nodes, while 3.6 doesn't.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb).
2. In the **MongoDB** drop-down list on the left sidebar, select **Replica Set Instance** or **Sharded Cluster Instance**. The directions for the two types of instances are similar.
3. Above the **Instance List** on the right, select the region.
4. In the **Instance List**, find the target instance.
5. Click the **Instance ID** to enter the **Instance Details** page and click the **Node Management** tab.
6. On the **Mongod Node** tab, click **Add Read-only Node**.
