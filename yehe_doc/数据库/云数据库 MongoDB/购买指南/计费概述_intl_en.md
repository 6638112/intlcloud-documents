## Billing Modes
TencentDB for MongoDB supports pay-as-you-go billing mode.
#### Pay-as-you-go
Pay-as-you-go is a postpaid billing mode. We recommend you choose the pay-as-you-go billing mode if your business may fluctuate greatly and unpredictably or your resource usage tends to be temporary or abrupt. When you purchase a TencentDB for MongoDB instance, the hardware fees of one hour will be frozen in your Tencent Cloud account and charged on the hour (Beijing time), with the billable usage duration accurate down to the second. In this mode, you only need to pay for the actual usage of TencentDB for MongoDB with no upfront payment required.
The tiered pricing model is based on usage duration.

- 0 days < duration ≤ 4 days: tier 1 pay-as-you-go price applies.
- 4 days < duration ≤ 15 days: tier 2 pay-as-you-go price applies.
- Duration > 15 days: tier 3 pay-as-you-go price applies.

## Compute
Computing resources include CPU resources and memory resources. Instance parameters such as the maximum QPS and number of access connections are subject to the selected computing resource specification. For the prices, please see [MongoDB Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/8364).

Currently, the following specifications are available:

>?
>- The above numbers of connections have taken effect since August 10, 2020.
>- For a replica set, the maximum number of connections for an instance is as indicated in the table above; for a sharded cluster, the maximum number of connections is the `number of shards * specification of single shard` or `18,000`, whichever is smaller.
For example, if a sharded cluster instance has 3 shards, each with 64 GB memory, then as 16,000 * 3 = 48,000 > 18,000, the maximum number of connections for this cluster will be 18,000.
