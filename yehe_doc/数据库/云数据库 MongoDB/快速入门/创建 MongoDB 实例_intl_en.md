## Overview

The TencentDB for MongoDB console makes working with database instances simple with no need to write code or run programs. This document describes how to purchase and configure a TencentDB for MongoDB instance as described in [Viewing Instance Details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/44179). 

## Prerequisites
