TencentDB data centers are hosted in multiple locations world-wide, covering South China, East China, North China, Southwest China, Hong Kong (China), Macao (China), Taiwan (China), Southeast Asia, South Asia, Northeast Asia, West US, East US, North America, Europe, and other regions. Tencent Cloud will gradually deploy nodes in more regions for a wider coverage. Currently, you can create TencentDB instances in the following regions.

>?
>- Tencent Cloud resources in the same VPC within the same region under the same account can communicate with each other by using [private IPs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225) over private network.
>- The networks of different regions are fully isolated from each other, and Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate over private network by default.
>- When you purchase Tencent Cloud services, we recommend you select the region closest to your end users to minimize access latency.


### China
>?Resources available in different regions and AZs may be sold out and become unavailable, and previously sold-out resources may be replenished. The resource availability will be assessed and adjusted based on the actual business usage as displayed on the purchase page in the console.
