## Data Structure
MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL (non-relational) database. Its data structure consists of fields and values like JSON objects. Below is an example:
```
{
   name:"John Smith",
   sex:"Male",
   age:25,
   status:"A",
   groups:["news","sports"]
}
```

## Storage Structure
MongoDB's storage structure consists of the following three units:
- Document: It is the most basic unit in MongoDB and composed of BSON key-value pairs.
```
{name:"Jane Smith",sex:"Female",age:25,status:"A"}
```
- Collection: A MongoDB collection can contain multiple documents. For example, you can insert documents with different data structures into the same collection.
```
{name:"Jane Smith",sex:"Female",age:25,status:"A"}
{name:"Jane Smith",sex:"Female",age:25,status:"A"}
{name:"Harry Smith",sex:"Male",age:26,status:"A",groups:["news","sports"]}
```
- Database: A MongoDB database can contain multiple collections, and you can create multiple databases.
