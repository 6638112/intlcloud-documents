### Can I change a TencentDB for SQL Server instance from two-node architecture (formerly High Availability/Cluster Edition) to single-node architecture (formerly Basic Edition)?
No. To adjust the architecture, purchase a new single-node (formerly Basic Edition) instance and migrate the data as instructed in [Cold Backup Migration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/39005).


### Can I upgrade TencentDB for SQL Server?
TencentDB for SQL Server single-node (formerly Basic Edition) and two-node (formerly High Availability/Cluster Edition) instances support version upgrade. For more information, see [Adjusting Instance Version](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/44354).

### Can I downgrade the TencentDB for SQL Server version ?
TencentDB for SQL Server doesn't support the version downgrade; for example, you cannot downgrade a Basic Edition instance from v2019 to v2017.
