### How do I back up TencentDB for SQL Server?
TencentDB for SQL Server has rich backup capabilities to guarantee the data security and prevent data loss or corruption. You can manage and view backups on the **Backup Management** page in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver). Specifically, you can configure automatic backup, manual backup, data backup, log backup, backup file format (unarchived files or archive file), instance backup, multi-database backup, and cross-region backup. You can also customize the backup policy, backup retention period (7â€“1,830 days), and backup cycle. For more information, see [Backup Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45857).

### How do I configure automatic backup?

### How do I create a backup manually?
You can do so on the **Backup Management** page in the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver). For more information, see [Creating Manual Backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45854).

### How do I view and modify backup policies?
You can do so on the **Backup Management** page in the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver). For more information, see [Configuring Automatic Backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45855).

### How long can TencentDB for SQL Server retain a backup?
The retention period of TencentDB for SQL Server automatic backups is seven days by default and can be customized. The validity period is subject to the configured number of backup days. For more information, see [Configuring Automatic Backup](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45855).

### Can I delete backups manually?
- You can't delete automatic backups manually, but you can set the retention period for them so that they are deleted automatically upon expiration.
- Manual backups can be manually deleted from the backup list in the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver). If they are not manually deleted, they will be retained for the same period as automatic backups.

### Can I disable data and log backups?
No. However, you can lower the backup frequency and delete manual backup files that are no longer used in the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver) to reduce the backup space usage.

### Why can't I initiate a manual backup task?
You need to check the automatic backup time you configured. If the instance is performing the daily automatic backup task, you cannot initiate a manual backup task.

### How do I cancel a backup task?
Backup tasks in TencentDB for SQL Server cannot be canceled.

### Is a database available during the backup time period?
A backup window is a custom time period for daily automatic backup, during which the TencentDB for SQL Server instance will be backed up. Based on such regular backups, TencentDB for SQL Server allows you to roll back the instance to a backup point within the retention period. During the backup window, the business won't be affected, but you cannot restart or manually backup the instance in the TencentDB for SQL Server console.

### How do I back up a database?
Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver), click the ID of the target instance in the instance list, select the **Backup Management** tab, click **Backup Task Settings**, and set **Upload Backup File** to **Unarchived files**. Then, the .bak file of each database in the instance will be directly uploaded to COS without being archived. For more information, see [Setting Backup Task](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45853).

### Can I use a third-party tool to automatically back up TencentDB for SQL Server?
TencentDB for SQL Server cannot be backed up with third-party tools. For security considerations, third-party tools cannot be granted the permissions of data directories on the physical machine. You can initiate backup tasks only in the console.

### Can I download or restore backup files that exceed the retention period?
Expired backup sets will be automatically deleted and cannot be downloaded or restored.
- We recommend that you configure a backup retention period based on business needs or download the backup files locally in the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
- You can also manually back up instance data in the console. Manual backups will be retained permanently.
>?Manual backups will also take up the backup space. We recommend that you plan the usage of the backup space appropriately to reduce costs.

### Can I download the backup files of an isolated instance?
Yes.
- A pay-as-you-go instance will be isolated and moved into the recycle bin 24 hours after expiration. At this time, rollback and manual backup will be prohibited, but automatic backup can still be downloaded by clicking **More** in the **Operation** column of the instance. Excessive backup space of the instance will continue to be billed until the instance is eliminated.

### Will backup files still be retained after a TencentDB for SQL Server instance is deleted?
After a TencentDB for SQL Server instance is deleted, all its backup files will be deleted automatically. To retain the data, back up the data first before deleting the instance.

### How is the TencentDB for SQL Server backup space billed?
TencentDB for SQL Server offers a certain amount of backup space free of charge by region, which is equivalent to the sum of storage spaces of all Basic Edition, Dual-Server High Availability Edition, and Cluster Edition primary instances in a region. For the pricing of backup space beyond the free tier, see [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45849).

### What should I do if the free tier of the backup space is exceeded?
If the size of backup files exceeds the free tier of the backup space, you can increase the storage space or reduce the backup space usage.
Instance backup files will use the backup space. Each TencentDB for SQL Server instance provides a certain free tier of backup space, and excessive usage will incur additional fees.

### How do I reduce the backup space cost?
- Delete manual backups that are no longer used.  You can do so on the **Instance Management** > **Backup Management** page in the [TencentDB for SQL Server](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver) console. 
- Reduce the frequency of automatic data backup for non-core businesses. You can adjust the backup cycle and backup file retention period in the console, which should be at least twice a week.
>?The rollback feature relies on the backup cycle and retention days of data backups and log backups. Rollback will be affected if you reduce the automatic backup frequency and retention period. You can select the parameters as needed. For more information, see [Rolling back Databases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/7522).
>
- Shorten the retention period of data and log backups for non-core businesses. A retention period of seven days can meet the needs in most cases.

| Business Scenario | Recommended Backup Retention Period |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Core businesses | 7-1,830 days |
| Non-core, non-data businesses | 7 days |
| Archival businesses | 7 days. We recommend that you manually back up data based on your actual business needs and delete the backups promptly after use |
| Testing businesses | 7 days. We recommend that you manually back up data based on your actual business needs and delete the backups promptly after use |

### What are the differences between direct backup upload and backup download from COS in cold backup migration?
- Direct backup upload: You can upload a local backup file to COS and download and restore it to TencentDB for SQL Server. Backup files uploaded to COS don't use any backup space. However, they can be retained for only 24 hours and will be deleted automatically after then.
- Backup download from COS: You can download a backup file from your COS bucket and restore it to TencentDB for SQL Server.

### If I directly upload a backup file in cold backup migration, will the file use my backup space?
Backup files uploaded in backup and restoration scenarios are directly uploaded to COS for relay and don't use your backup space. Once successfully uploaded, they will be retained for only 24 hours and will be deleted automatically after then.
