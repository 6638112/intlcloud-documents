 
TencentDB for SQL Server will adjust the composition rules of the disk storage space on February 7, 2023, and the system databases of new instances will be counted in the disk storage space.

Before the adjustment, the disk storage space consists of **data file space, transaction log file space, and temp table files**.
After the adjustment, the disk storage space will consist of **data file space, transaction log file space, temp table files, and system databases**.

Here:
- **Data file space**: The space used by your data. The data file space of SQL Server is preallocated, so every database will take up nearly 500 MB space to store your data.
- **Transaction log file space**: Each database in a TencentDB for SQL Server instance has a log file. In full recovery model, database transaction logs will be written to the log file.
- **Temp table files**: Files used by `TEMPDB` of the TencentDB for SQL Server instance and generated by complex queries.
- **System databases**: Files generated by the system databases of the TencentDB for SQL Server instance.
