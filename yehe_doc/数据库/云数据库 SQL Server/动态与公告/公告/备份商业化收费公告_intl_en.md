The commercialized backup feature of TencentDB for SQL Server has been released. Billing will officially start at 00:00 on June 1, 2022, and backup spaces beyond the free tier will be charged. We recommend you read the billing rules in [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45849) and adjust your backup policy based on your business conditions.

TencentDB for SQL Server will provide a free tier equivalent to the sum of storage spaces of all Basic Edition, High Availability Edition, and Cluster Edition primary instances in a region, and backup spaces beyond the free tier will be pay-as-you-go by hour.
