Dear user,
To provide you with better services, Tencent Cloud has stopped the creation of TencentDB for SQL Server instances in the classic network on April 30, 2022 and will officially deactivate the classic network product itself on December 31, 2022. The services will then be provided by corresponding VPC products. You can change the network of your existing instances [from the classic network to VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/46498).

As the current mainstream cloud network environment, VPC has all the features of the classic network and provides a more secure, flexible, and stable network environment and user experience. If your business is still using the classic network, we recommend you migrate it to VPC for a better service experience.

[Contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/31434) if you need any further help.
