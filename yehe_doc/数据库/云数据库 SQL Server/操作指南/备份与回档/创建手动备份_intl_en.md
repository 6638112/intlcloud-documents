TencentDB for SQL Server supports automatic backup and manual backup. This document describes how to create a manual backup in the console.
>!
>- Backup files are stored in a separate backup space and do not occupy the local disk space of the instance.
>- Do not perform DDL operations during the backup process to avoid backup failure caused by table locking.
>- Back up your data during off-peak hours.
>- Backup may take a long time if the data volume is large.

## Prerequisites
