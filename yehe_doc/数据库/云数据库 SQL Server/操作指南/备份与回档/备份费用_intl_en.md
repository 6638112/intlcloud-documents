When you purchase TencentDB for SQL Server primary instances, you will receive free backup capacity. The backup space range is calculated separately for each region of an account. Excess backup files will be charged if your backup space exceeds the free tier.

This document describes backup fees. For more information, see [Backup Space Billing Notes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/45849).

## Billing Mode
Backup space is billed in pay-as-you-go mode. Fees will be charged for actual backup space usage beyond the free tier.
