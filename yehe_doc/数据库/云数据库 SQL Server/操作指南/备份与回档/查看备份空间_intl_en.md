This document describes how to view the backup space in the console.

## Overview
The backup space occupied by TencentDB for SQL Server instance backup files is allocated by region. It is equivalent to the total storage capacity used by all database backups in a region, including local and cross-region automatic data backups, manual data backups, and log backups. For cross-region backup, the backup volume is counted in the backup space for the backup region of the primary instance, and backup fees are calculated at the price of the backup storage region (i.e., the destination region).

Increasing the backup retention period or frequency will use more database backup space. You can view the backup space statistics and trends of all instances in each region under your account as well as the real-time backup space statistics of each instance.


## Viewing the total backup
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Database Backup**.
3. On the **Database Backup** page, select a region to view the backup space and number of all backups, data backups, and log backups on the **Overview** tab, including those of local backup and cross-region backup.

>? In the **Total Backup** section, you can view the usage details of the free space. Cross-region backup cannot use the free space; in other words, the space used by the backup files generated by cross-region backup will incur fees.

## Viewing the backup trend
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Database Backup**.
3. On the **Database Backup** page, select a region. Then, you can view the trend of total local or cross-region backup space size at the bottom of the **Overview** tab by time (last hour, last 24 hours, today, last 7 days, last 30 days, or a selected custom time period).

## Viewing real-time backup statistics
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Database Backup**.
3. On the **Database Backup** page, select a region to view the real-time backup statistics at the bottom of the **Overview** tab. For local backup, you can view the instance ID/name, backup space, data backup, log backup, automatic backup, and manual backup. For cross-region backup, you can view the instance ID/name, cross-region backup status, last backup region, backup retention period (day), last backup start time, total backup, data backup, log backup, and operations (cross-region backup settings).

>?The list of real-time cross-region backup statistics displays only the information of instances with cross-region backup enabled as well as instances with cross-region backup disabled but with existing cross-region backup files retained.
4. On the backup statistics page, you can search for an instance by instance ID to view its real-time backup statistics. You can also perform various operations such as sorting statistical fields by space size, refreshing the statistics page, and downloading data.
