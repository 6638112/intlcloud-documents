TencentDB for SQL Server allows you to modify the instance-level character set collation when creating an instance. This operation can be performed only on the purchase page. The character set of an instance provides a collation for system data, i.e., the case sensitivity and accent sensitivity attributes. Selecting a collation for your database will affect the results of relevant database operations.

This document describes how to modify the character set collation.
>!
>- **As modifying the instance-level character set collation requires separately configuring physical machine resources**, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) and specify the desired character set collation before purchase.
>- If you have modified the character set collation for your instance, and a subsequent **scale-out involves data migration**, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
>- The default collation of instance character sets is Chinese_PRC_CI_AS.
