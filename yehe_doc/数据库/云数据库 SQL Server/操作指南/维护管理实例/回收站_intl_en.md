Terminated instances will be put into the recycle bin and can be restored.

## Background
Tencent Cloud recycle bin offers a mechanism for repossessing cloud resources. If your account balance is sufficient, you can restore terminated instances that are still in the recycle bin.

## Version Requirement
Currently, all TencentDB for SQL Server versions support instance repossession.

## Notes
- **For pay-as-you-go instances in the recycle bin:**
 - **Retention period:** If your account has no overdue payments, terminated instances will be retained in the recycle bin for 24 hours.
 - **Expiration processing**: Instances that are not renewed before the retention period of 24 hours ends will be released and cannot be restored.

## Prerequisites
- The TencentDB for SQL Server instance has been terminated.
- Your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient.
