## Overview
As the business grows, more and more devices and instances need to be managed. The reasonable categorization of resources has become an important means of resource management. TencentDB for SQL Server allows you to add remarks to instances in the console for easier instance identification and management.

## Notes
- Both primary and read-only instances support remarks.
- Instance remarks can contain up to 200 Chinese characters, letters, digits, or underscores.
- You can edit, modify, and delete instance remarks.

2. Select the region at the top, find the target instance, and click the target instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
