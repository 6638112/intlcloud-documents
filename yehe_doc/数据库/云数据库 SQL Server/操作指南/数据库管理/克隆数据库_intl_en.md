## Overview
TencentDB for SQL Server provides the database cloning feature for you to quickly clone an existing database to your current instance. You need to specify the new database name during cloning, while other information items such as account permissions of the new database are the same as those of the source database.

## Prerequisites
The source database is in **Running** status.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
2. Select the region at the top, find the target instance, and click the target instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
