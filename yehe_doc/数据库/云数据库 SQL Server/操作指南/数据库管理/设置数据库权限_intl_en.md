## Overview
TencentDB for SQL Server allows you to grant and modify database account permissions. You cannot modify the root account's permissions because it has read/write access to all databases in a TencentDB for SQL Server instance. On the database management page, you can grant other accounts read/write or read-only access to created databases.

## Prerequisites
- You have created an account other than the root account in your TencentDB for SQL Server instance as instructed in [Creating Accounts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/7521).
- You have created at least one database in your TencentDB for SQL Server instance as instructed in [Creating Database](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/35780).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver).
2. Select the region at the top, find the target instance, and click the target instance ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
