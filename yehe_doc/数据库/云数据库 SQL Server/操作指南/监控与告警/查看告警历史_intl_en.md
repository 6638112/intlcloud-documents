You can create alarm policies to trigger alarms and send notifications in the console when the TencentDB for SQL Server instance status changes. The created alarm policies can determine whether an alarm needs to be triggered based on the difference between the monitoring metric value and the given threshold at intervals.
You can view specific information of alarm records in the console, and quickly locate the problem for further troubleshooting by alarm messages.

This document describes how to view alarm records in the console.
