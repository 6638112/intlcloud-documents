## Region
### Overview
A region is the physical location of an IDC. In Tencent Cloud, regions are fully isolated from each other, ensuring cross-region stability and fault tolerance. When purchasing Tencent Cloud services, we recommend selecting the region closest to your end users to minimize access latency and improve download speed.

### Characteristics
- The networks of different regions are fully isolated from each other, and Tencent Cloud services in different regions **cannot communicate using private networks by default**.
- Tencent Cloud services in different VPCs can communicate with each other over [Cloud Connect Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003) which is fast and stable.
- [Cloud Load Balancer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214) currently supports intra-region traffic forwarding by default. If [cross-region binding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/38441) is enabled, cross-region binding of CLB and TencentDB instances is supported.

## AZ
### Overview
An availability zone (AZ) is a physical IDC of Tencent Cloud with independent power supply and network in the same region. It can ensure business stability, as failures (except for major disasters or power failures) in one AZ are isolated without affecting other AZs in the same region. By starting an instance in an independent AZ, users can protect their applications from being affected by a single point of failure.

### Characteristics
Tencent Cloud services in the same VPC are interconnected over the private network, which means they can communicate using [private IPs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225), even if they are in different AZs of the same region.
>?Private network interconnection refers to the interconnection of resources under the same account. Resources under different accounts are completely isolated on the private network.

## Selection of Regions and AZs
- The geographic locations of TencentDB instances, your business, and your target users:
We recommend you choose the region closest to your end users when purchasing TencentDB instances to minimize access latency and improve access speed.
- Other Tencent Cloud services you use.
When you select other Tencent Cloud services, we recommend you try to locate them all in the same region and AZ to allow them to communicate with each other through the private network, reducing access latency and increasing access speed.
- High availability and disaster recovery.
Even if you have just one VPC, we still recommend you deploy your businesses in different AZs to prevent a single point of failure and enable cross-AZ disaster recovery.
- There may be network latency among different AZs. We recommend you assess your business requirements and find the optimal balance between high availability and low latency.
- If you need access to servers in other countries or regions, we recommend you select an instance in those other countries or regions. If you use a TencentDB instance in [China](#MainlandChina1) to access [servers in other countries and regions](#InternationalArea1), you may encounter a higher network latency.

## Resource Availability
