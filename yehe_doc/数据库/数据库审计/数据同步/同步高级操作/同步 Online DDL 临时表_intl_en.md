## Overview
When performing an online DDL operation on tables in the source database with the gh-ost or pt-online-schema-change (pt-osc) tool, you need to sync the temp tables generated by online DDL changes to the target database.
DTS allows you to associate the temp table names of the object table in advance when selecting the sync objects, so that the object table can be synced together with the temp tables subsequently generated by the source database.  
- When you perform an online DDL operation on the table `table name` with the gh-ost tool, DTS supports syncing temp tables `_table name_ghc`, `_table name_gho`, and `_table name_del` to the target database. 
- When you perform an online DDL operation on the table `table name` with the pt-osc tool, DTS supports syncing temp tables `_table name_new` and `_table name_old` to the target database.

## Application scope
 Currently, temp tables can be synced between MySQL, MariaDB, Percona, and TDSQL-C for MySQL.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [DTS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dts/replication) and select **Data Sync** on the left sidebar to create a sync task.
2. In the **Set sync options and objects** step, in **Selected Object** on the right, hover over an object to be modified and click the displayed **Edit** icon.

3. In the pop-up window, select **Sync Temp Table**, select the tables to be synced, and click **OK**.
 - When you perform an online DDL operation with gh-ost, select temp tables `_table name_ghc`, `_table name_gho`, and `_table name_del`. 
 - When you perform an online DDL operation with pt-osc, select temp tables `_table name_new` and `_table name_old`.
After the temp table sync feature is used, ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/dfacb477b4cf9ba2d1046c5ccff9e463.png) will be displayed before the names of the selected object tables, and you can hover over it to view the selected temp tables.
>?
> - If the source database already contains tables with the same names as temp tables `_table name_new` and `_table name_old`, pt-osc will generate other temp tables with different names, which DTS cannot sync. In this case, you must select the entire database (or entire instance) where the table to be synced resides rather than only the table itself as the **Sync Object**; otherwise, data in the temp tables generated by online DDL changes cannot be synced to the target database.
> - The table mapping (table renaming) feature conflicts with the temp table sync feature, and only one of them can be enabled at any time.
