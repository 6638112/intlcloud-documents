## Serverless service strengths
- Autopilot: The database can automatically start/stop according to the business load and scale in an imperceptible manner without causing disconnections.
- Utility pricing: The database is billed based on the actual computing and storage usage which is calculated by second and settled by hour.

## Use cases
- Low-frequency database usage scenarios such as development and test environments.
- Scenarios where the load is uncertain, such as IoT and edge computing.
- SaaS application scenarios such as SME website construction.
- Education scenarios such as experiment and teaching environment.
- Fully managed and Ops-free scenarios.
