TDSQL-C for MySQL is highly elastic and performant database service that features excellent storage capacity, security, and reliability. It helps you easily tackle your needs in diverse business scenarios, such as frequent transactions like commodity orders, fast-growing businesses with traffic peaks, gaming, data-heavy infrequent queries like historical orders, financial data security protection, development, testing, and cost-sensitive businesses. TDSQL-C for MySQL offers the following benefits and strengths to suit you in the best possible way.

## Mobile internet application
- It delivers commercial database-grade high performance and reliability. Its multiple custom-developed kernel optimizations and enterprise-grade features ensure smooth and efficient business operations, so that R&D personnel can focus on the development of business logic without worries.
- It solves the problems of poor flexibility, low sync efficiency under high business pressure, and uncontrollable switch time in the traditional source-replica architecture. It ensures high system availability and business continuity while delivering high performance, which greatly reduces the workload of operations and Ops personnel.
- It is fully compatible with open-source MySQL, so that your existing business applications can be connected with almost no changes required, helping you cloudify your business smoothly.
- It has a built-in high availability architecture and automatically maintains multiple data replicas, checks data, and fixes errors, which reduce human intervention and achieve a data reliability of up to 99.9999999% (nine nines).

## Ecommerce/Education live streaming
- It can be upgraded within seconds and expanded to 15 nodes at most to quickly increase the QPS, as compared with traditional databases where configuration upgrade takes longer as the storage capacity and host resource usage grow.
- It delivers an excellent data write performance under high concurrency thanks to its engine optimizations and IOPS capability enhancement, helping you tackle business surges easily.
- It leverages physical replication between the read-write and read-only nodes, which greatly reduces the delay and ensures the data consistency between buyers and sellers in ecommerce scenarios.

## Finance and insurance
- It is deployed in a multi-AZ architecture for disaster recovery and backup, with data backups stored in multiple AZs.
- It adopts comprehensive methods such as allowlist and VPC to provide security guarantees for various links in database data access, storage, and management.
- It uses the shared distributed storage architecture, which completely resolves the problem of poor data consistency in replica databases caused by async source-replica replication.
