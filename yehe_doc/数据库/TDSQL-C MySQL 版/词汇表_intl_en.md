## DBA
See [Database administrator](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1098/40645).

## Region
A region refers to a geographical location where data centers hosted by Tencent Cloud are distributed. Each region has multiple availability zones.
For example, the region of one hosted data center is Beijing, and the availability zone is Beijing Zone 1. Tencent Cloud services in the same region can communicate with each other over the private network, but those in different regions cannot. Therefore, we recommend you choose the region that is closest to your customers to minimize the access latency and improve the download speed.

## AZ
An availability zone (AZ) is a physical IDC of Tencent Cloud with independent power supply and network in the same region. It can ensure business stability, as failures in one AZ are isolated without affecting other AZs in the same region.

## Transactions per second
Transactions per second (TPS) is the number of transactions a system can process per second. It is a key metric for evaluating the processing capabilities of a system.

## QPS/Concurrency
Queries per second (QPS) measures the requests processed concurrently per second. 1 QPS means that the API processed 1 request per second; 50 QPS means that the API processed 50 requests per second.

## Database administrator
A database administrator (DBA) is a person responsible for managing the database by using specialized software to store and organize data. The responsibilities of this role may include capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, and backup and restoration.
