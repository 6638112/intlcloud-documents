A character set is a mapping relationship or encoding rule, including a coded character set and character encoding. The code points corresponding to a character set are mapped into binary sequences, so that they can be stored and processed by a computer.

This document describes how to change the character set of an instance in the console.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL-C for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cynosdb) and click the ID of the target cluster in the cluster list to enter the cluster management page.
2. On the instance management page, select the **Instance List** tab and click the ID of the target read-write or read-only instance to enter the instance details page.
