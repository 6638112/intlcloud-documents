This document describes the features and use cases of the database proxy service in TDSQL-C for MySQL.

Database proxy is a network proxy service between the TencentDB service and the application service. It is used to proxy all requests when the application service accesses the database.
The database proxy access address is independent of the original database access address. Requests arriving at the proxy address are all relayed through the proxy cluster to access the source and replica nodes of the database. Read/Write requests are separated, so that read requests are forwarded to read-only instances, which lowers the load of the source database.
>?The database proxy is currently in the beta test and will be available in more regions. If no database proxy option is offered in your cluster's region,  the service is temporarily unavailable there.

## Features
- **High stability**
The database proxy is deployed in the cluster architecture, with multiple nodes ensuring smooth failover.
- **Strong isolation**
The database proxy provides the proxy service for the current instance with independent resources. The resources of each proxy are isolated and not shared.
- **Ultra-high performance**
Each proxy can process up to 100,000 requests per second.
- **Convenient and fast scaling**
You can dynamically add 1â€“60 proxy nodes, with only 6 nodes supported during the beta test.
- **Comprehensive performance monitoring**
Performance metrics are monitored at the second level, such as the number of read/write requests, CPU, and memory. The number of proxies can be adjusted according to the [monitoring data](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1098/49995) and business planning.
- **Hot reload**
When a read-write instance is switched, or its configuration is changed, or a read-only instance is added/removed, the database proxy can dynamically hot reload the configuration without causing network disconnections or restarts.
- **[Automatic read/write separation](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1098/49992)**
It can effectively reduce the read load of the read-write instance when the read/write separation feature of the database proxy is enabled. Read-only instances can be added to horizontally scale the database cluster and automatically implement read/write separation, which eliminates the complexity of manually separating read and write requests of the business. This is especially suitable for scenarios with a high read load.
After the read/write separation feature of the database proxy is enabled, only one proxy connection address needs to be configured in the application. This address will automatically implement read/write separation and send read requests to read-only instances and write requests to the read-write instance. Even if you add or remove read-only instances, you don't need to adjust the application settings.

## Use Cases
- Businesses with low performance when there is a large number of non-persistent connections.
- Businesses use multiple read-only instances, and read/write separation is implemented manually on applications, resulting in higher maintenance costs and risks.
- High instance loading caused by too many connections.
