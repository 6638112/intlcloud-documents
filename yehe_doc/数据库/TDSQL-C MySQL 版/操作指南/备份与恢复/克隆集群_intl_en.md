TDSQL-C for MySQL can [roll back databases/tables to the original cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1098/40634) and roll back an entire cluster (clone) to a new cluster. You can choose different rollback methods according to your business needs. This document describes how to clone a cluster in the console to quickly roll back an instance into a new cluster.

TDSQL-C for MySQL provides the clone feature, which can restore a cluster to any time point in the log backup retention period or to the backup set of the specified backup file through clone.
The clone will create a new cluster based on your choice. After the new cluster is verified, you can either [migrate the data back to the original cluster through DTS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/42642) or use the new cluster directly.

>?Billing will start for the new cluster after the clone succeeds. For more information on billing and pricing, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1098/40620).
