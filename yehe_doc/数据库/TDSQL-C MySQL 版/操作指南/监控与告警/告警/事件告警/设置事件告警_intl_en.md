TDSQL-C for MySQL supports the event alarming feature. After you set an event rule, target, and recipient, if this feature detects an abnormal event, it will send alarm notifications to the recipient through various channels. This document describes how to set an event alarm.

## Step 1. Activate EventBridge
EventBridge uses CAM to manage permissions. CAM is a permission and access management service that helps you securely manage the access permissions of resources under your Tencent Cloud account. With CAM, you can create, manage, and terminate users and user groups and use identity and policy management to control user access to Tencent Cloud resources. To use EventBridge with a root account or sub-account, you need to activate it first as instructed in [Activating EventBridge](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42272).

## Step 2. Configure event alarm push for TDSQL-C for MySQL
After activating EventBridge, you need to select the event source connection method. Currently, you can select TDSQL-C for MySQL monitoring events as an event source.
>!
>- Ops events generated in TDSQL-C for MySQL such as alarms and audits will all be published to the **Tencent Cloud service event bus** by default, which cannot be changed or edited.
>- After EventBridge is activated, it will automatically create a **default Tencent Cloud service event bus** in **Guangzhou** region, to which alarm events (monitoring and audit events) generated by TDSQL-C for MySQL will be automatically published.

1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb?regionId=1).
2. Select the **Guangzhou** region at the top.
3. Click the **default** event bus below **Tencent Cloud Service Event Bus**.
