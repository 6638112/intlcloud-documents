If you need to use TDSQL-C for MySQL in SCF, you can use the connection pool or the SDK provided by the SCF team for connection. The connection pool supports automatic reconnection to effectively avoid connection unavailability due to connection release by the SCF underlying layer or database.

For detailed directions, see [Connecting SCF to Database](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/44901).
