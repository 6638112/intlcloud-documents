After registering a Tencent Cloud account, you need to complete identity verification or industry information.

<dx-alert infotype="alarm" title="">
Identity directly affects the ownership of accounts and resources. If the enterprise users verify their identity with personal information, future personnel changes or account disputes may affect the business of the enterprise user and even cause economic losses. Therefore, before identity verification, you must confirm whether the resources you purchase and use in Tencent Cloud are owned by individuals or enterprises.
