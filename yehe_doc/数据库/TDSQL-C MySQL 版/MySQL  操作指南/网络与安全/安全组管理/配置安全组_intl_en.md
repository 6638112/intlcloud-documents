## Overview
A [security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12452) is a stateful virtual firewall capable of filtering. As an important means for network security isolation provided by Tencent Cloud, it can be used to set network access controls for one or more TencentDB instances. Instances with the same network security isolation demands in one region can be put into the same security group, which is a logical group. TencentDB and CVM share the security group list and are matched with each other within the security group based on rules. For specific rules and limitations, see [Security Group Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/38750).

>?
>- TDSQL-C for MySQL security groups currently only support network access control for VPCs and public networks but not the classic network.
>- Security groups associated with TencentDB instances in the Frankfurt, Silicon Valley, and Singapore regions currently do not support public network access control.
>- As TencentDB does not have active outbound traffic, outbound rules are not applicable to TencentDB.
>- TDSQL-C for MySQL security groups support primary and read-only instances.


## Configuring Security Groups for TencentDB
### Step 1. Create a security group
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup).
2. Select **Security Group** on the left sidebar, select a region, and click **Create**.
3. In the pop-up dialog window, configure the following items, and click **OK**.
 - **Template**: select a template based on the service to be deployed on the TencentDB instance in the security group, which simplifies the security group rule configuration, as shown below:
<table>
	<tr><th>Template</th><th>Description</th><th>Remarks</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Open all ports</td><td>All ports are open. May present security issues.</td><td>-</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Open ports 22, 80, 443, and 3389 and the ICMP protocol</td><td>Ports 22, 80, 443, and 3389 and the ICMP protocol are opened to the internet. All ports are opened to the private network.</td><td>This template does not take effect for TencentDB.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Custom</td><td>You can create a security group and then add custom rules. For detailed directions, see "Step 2. Add a security group rule"</a> below.</td><td>-</rd></tr>
</table>
 - **Name**: name of the security group.
 - **Project**: select a project for easier management. By default, **DEFAULT PROJECT** is selected.
 - **Notes**: a short description of the security group for easier management.


### Step 2. Add a security group rule
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, click **Modify Rule** in the **Operation** column on the row of the security group for which to configure a rule.
2. On the security group rule page, click **Inbound Rules** > **Add Rule**.
3. In the pop-up window, set the rule.
 - **Type**: **Custom** is selected by default. You can also choose another system rule template. MySQL(3306) is recommended.
 - **Source** or **Target**: traffic source (inbound rules) or target (outbound rules). You need to specify one of the following options:
<table>
	<tr><th>Source or Target</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>A single IPv4 address or an IPv4 range</td><td>In CIDR notation, such as <code>203.0.113.0</code>, <code>203.0.113.0/24</code> or <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>, where <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> indicates all IPv4 addresses will be matched.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A single IPv6 address or an IPv6 range</td><td>In CIDR notation, such as <code>FF05::B5</code>, <code>FF05:B5::/60</code>, <code>::/0</code> or <code>0::0/0</code>, where <code>::/0</code> or <code>0::0/0</code> indicates all IPv6 addresses will be matched.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ID of referenced security group. You can reference the ID of:<ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>Current security group</li><li>Other security group</li></ul>
</td><td><ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>To reference the current security group, enter the ID of security group associated with the CVM.</li><li>You can also reference another security group in the same region and the same project by entering the security group ID.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Reference an IP address object or IP address group object in a <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31867">parameter template</a>.</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>
 - **Protocol Port**: enter the protocol type and port range or reference a protocol/port or protocol/port group in a [parameter template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31867).
>!To connect to a TDSQL-C for MySQL instance, its port must be opened. You can log in to the [TDSQL-C console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cynosdb), click a cluster ID to enter the cluster details page, and view the port number.
>The security group rules displayed on the **Security Group** page in the TDSQL-C for MySQL console take effect for private and public (if enabled) network addresses of the TDSQL-C for MySQL instance.
>
 - **Policy**: **Allow** or **Reject**. **Allow** is selected by default.
    - **Allow**: traffic to this port is allowed.
    - **Reject**: data packets will be discarded without any response.
 - **Notes**: a short description of the rule for easier management.
4. Click **Complete**.
              
### Step 3. Configure a security group
A security group is an instance-level firewall provided by Tencent Cloud for controlling inbound traffic of TencentDB. You can associate a security group with an instance when purchasing it or later in the console.

>!Currently, security groups can be configured only for TDSQL-C for MySQL instances in **VPCs**.

1. Log in to the [TDSQL-C console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cynosdb) and click a cluster ID in the cluster list to enter the cluster management page.
2. On the cluster management page, select the **Security Group** tab and click **Configure Security Group**.
3. In the pop-up window, select the security group to be bound and click **OK**. 

## Importing Security Group Rules
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, click the ID/name of the target security group.
2. On the **Inbound Rules** or **Outbound Rules** tab, click **Import Rule**.
3. In the pop-up window, select an edited inbound/outbound rule template file and click **Import**.
>? As existing rules will be overwritten after importing, we recommend that you export the existing rules before importing new ones.

## Cloning Security Groups
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, locate the target security group and click **More** > **Clone** in the **Operation** column.
2. In the pop-up window, select the target region and target project, enter the new security group name, and click **OK**. If the new security group needs to be associated with a CVM instance, do so by managing the CVM instances in the security group.

## Deleting Security Groups
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, locate the security group to be deleted and click **More** > **Delete** in the **Operation** column.
2. Click **OK** in the pop-up window. If the current security group is associated with a CVM instance, it must be disassociated before it can be deleted.
