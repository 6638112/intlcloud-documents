## FAQs
#### Where can I query the AZ information of a cluster?
- In the **AZ** column in the cluster list.
- In **Basic Info** > **Region/AZ** on the cluster details page.
- In **Availability Info** on the cluster details page.

#### Will my cluster run normally during the AZ modification?
- During the start and modification operations of the AZ modification task, normal access to read-only and read-write instances will be unaffected.
- The database connection addresses (clusterâ€™s read-write address and read-only address) will remain unchanged after the AZ is modified, so you can continue to access your cluster at these addresses.
