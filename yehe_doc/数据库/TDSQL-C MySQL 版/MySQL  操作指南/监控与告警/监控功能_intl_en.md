To make it easier for you to view and stay up to date with how instances work, TDSQL-C for MySQL provides a wide variety of performance monitoring metrics and convenient monitoring features (custom view, time comparison, merged monitoring metrics, etc). You can log in to the [TDSQL-C for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cynosdb), click a cluster ID in the cluster list to enter the instance list, click an instance ID, and select **Instance Monitoring** to view them.

>?If the number of tables in a single instance exceeds one million, database monitoring may be affected. Make sure that the number of tables in a single instance is below one million.

## Types of Instances for Monitoring
TDSQL-C for MySQL offers instance-level monitoring information, supports monitoring read-write and read-only instances, and provides each instance with a separate monitoring view for easy query.

## Monitoring Granularity
TDSQL-C for MySQL has adopted an adaptive policy for monitoring granularity, which means that you cannot select a monitoring granularity as desired for the time being. The adaptive policy is as follows:

| Time Span | Monitoring Granularity | Adaptation Description | Retention Period |
|:-------|:--------|:----|:-----|
| (0h, 4h] | 5 seconds | The time span is below 4 hours, and the monitoring granularity is 5 seconds | 1 day |
| (4h, 2d] | 1 minute | The time span is above 4 hours but below 2 days, and the monitoring granularity is 1 minute | 15 days |
| (2d, 10d] | 5 minutes | The time span is above 2 days but below 10 days, and the monitoring granularity is 5 minutes | 31 days |
| (10d, 30d] | 1 hour | The time span is above 10 days but below 30 days, and the monitoring granularity is 1 hour | 62 days |

>?Currently, you can view the monitoring data of TDSQL-C for MySQL in the last 30 days.
