The TencentDB team will perform grayscale upgrade on the backend system of all TDSQL-C for MySQL clusters in batches to improve the performance and stability. **During the upgrade, database access will not be affected, but a network jitter lasting only milliseconds may occur in extreme cases.** For more information on the involved regions, AZs, and upgrade time, see the following table:

>?The upgrade time is a period of time when all the clusters in a region are upgraded. The network jitters only once in each cluster.
