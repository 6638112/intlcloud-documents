Tags are key-value pairs provided by Tencent Cloud to easily identify resources. For more information, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/651/13334).

You can use tags to categorize and manage database resources by various metrics such as business, purpose, and owner. You can also easily find a resource by its tag. In Tencent Cloud, the tag key-value pairs have no semantic meaning and are strictly parsed and matched as strings. To use tags, pay attention to the [use limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/651/13354) first.
