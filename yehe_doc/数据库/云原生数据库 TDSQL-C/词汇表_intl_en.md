### Region
Tencent Cloud data centers are hosted in multiple locations worldwide. These locations are known as regions. Each region is an independent geographic area containing multiple isolated availability zones (AZs).

### AZ
AZs refer to Tencent Cloud's physical data centers that are in the same region. Each AZ is independently powered and have its own network resources. They are designed to ensure that failures within one AZ can be isolated from other zones, thereby ensuring service availability and business stability, excepting the occurrences of large-scale disasters or major power failures. Users can protect their applications from being affected by failures that occur in a single location by selecting instances in independent AZs.
