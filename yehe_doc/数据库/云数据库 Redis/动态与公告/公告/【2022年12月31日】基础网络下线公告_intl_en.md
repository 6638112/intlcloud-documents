Dear user,
Tencent Cloud stopped the support of the creation of any new resources in the classic network on **March 31, 2022** and will officially discontinue the classic network product from **December 31, 2022**. After that, all classic network-based resources will be migrated to VPC.

As the current mainstream cloud network environment, VPC has all the features of the classic network while providing a more secure, flexible, and stable network environment and user experience. If your business is still using the classic network, we recommend you migrate it to VPC for a better service experience.
