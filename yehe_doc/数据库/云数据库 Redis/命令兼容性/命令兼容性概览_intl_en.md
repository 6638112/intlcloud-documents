Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) stores data in a distributed manner, and its biggest difference from standard architecture lies in whether a single command supports multikey access. For the cluster architecture, commands can be categorized into partially supported, custom, and unsupported as detailed below:

| Command Type | Description |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Unsupported commands | `(error) ERR unknown command 'keys'` will be returned for unsupported commands. For more information on the commands supported by different versions and architectures, see [Commands Supported by Different Versions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31958). |
| Partially supported commands       | Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) is compatible with smart clients such as JedisCluster. For compatibility with JedisCluster, TencentDB for Redis modifies the IP list returned by the supported commands, and the IP address of each node in the returned information is the instance's VIP. For more information, see [Use Cases of Partially Supported Commands](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/48365). |
| Supported cross-slot commands   | Currently, cross-slot access commands supported by Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) include MGET, MSET, and DEL but not other multikey commands. |
| Custom commands | Custom commands support the access of each node in a cluster. A new parameter **Node ID** is added to the right of the parameter list of the original command, including `INFO`, `MEMORY`, `SLOWLOG`, `FLUSHDB`, `PING`, and `KEYS` (with hashtag supported for preferred match). For more information, see [Use Cases of Custom Commands](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/48364). |
| Supported DMC commands        | Database Management Center (DMC) allows you to log in to your TencentDB instances to access them, view their key metric information, and run Redis commands. For more information, see [List of Supported DMC Commands](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/48363). |
| Transactional commands           | Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) supports transactional commands provided that the transactions are started by the `WATCH` command. The keys of a transaction should be stored in the same slot, and the keys of `WATCH` and transaction-related keys should also be stored in the same slot. Hashtag is recommended for multikey transactions in cluster mode. |
| Multi-database commands | Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) supports multiple databases (256 by default); therefore, it can support all commands related to database operations. |
