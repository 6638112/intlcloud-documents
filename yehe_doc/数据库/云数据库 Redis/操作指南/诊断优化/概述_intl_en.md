TencentDB for Redis is connected to the performance optimization feature of DBbrain. The feature monitors and diagnoses database instance exceptions in real time, automatically generates health reports, and gives expert optimization suggestions. This helps you stay on top of the running status of the current database, quickly locate and troubleshoot issues, and promptly optimize the database performance.

## Viewing Performance Optimization

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Performance Optimization**.
3. At the top of the **Performance Optimization** page of **DBbrain**, select the target instance in the **Instance ID** drop-down list.
