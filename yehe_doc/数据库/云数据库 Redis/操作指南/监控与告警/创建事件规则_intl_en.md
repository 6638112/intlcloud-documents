## Overview
TencentDB for Redis has been connected to [Cloud Monitor (CM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248) to report cloud monitoring events. All events will be automatically delivered to the [Event Bus](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42284) in [EventBridge](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42267).

### Cloud Monitor Event
Currently, the following **events** can be reported:

| Event Name | Event Type | Dimension | Recoverable | Description | Troubleshooting and Suggestions |
| --------------- | ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Master/Replica switch | MasterSlaveSwitched | Status change | TencentDB for Redis instance | No | A failover occurs in TencentDB for Redis. | The failure will cause the TencentDB for Redis service to become inaccessible and momentarily unavailable. Make sure that your business has an automatic reconnection mechanism for quick business recovery. |
| Unavailable service | ServiceNotAvailable | Abnormal event | TencentDB for Redis instance | Yes | The TencentDB for Redis service is unavailable due to a failure. | We will recover the service as soon as possible and send a service recovery notification. If you have a disaster recovery instance, try switching your business to it. |
| Read-only replica failover | ReadonlyReplicaSwitched | Status change | TencentDB for Redis instance | Yes | A failover occurs in the TencentDB for Redis read-only replica. | We will recover the service as soon as possible and send a service recovery notification. If you have a disaster recovery instance, try switching your business to it or add more read-only replicas. |
| Unavailable read-only replica | ReadonlyReplicaNotAvailable | Abnormal event | TencentDB for Redis instance | Yes | A failure occurs in the TencentDB for Redis read-only replica. | We will recover the service as soon as possible and send a service recovery notification. If you have a disaster recovery instance, try switching your business to it or add more read-only replicas. |
| Instance migration due to server failure | ServerfailureInstanceMigration | Status change | TencentDB for Redis instance | Yes | A failover occurs in TencentDB for Redis. | The system detects that there is hardware risks in the server. The automatic migration time is subject to the maintenance window. Change the time promptly if needed. |


### Event Target
An event rule can have multiple event targets. Before creating an event rule, plan the event target types first. Currently, EventBridge supports the following event targets.

- [Message Push Target](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46779) (supported by rules only in the Tencent Cloud service event bus)
- [CLS Log Target] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46992)
- [SCF Target](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46254)
- [CKafka Target](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46249)

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb), and select **Event Rule** (https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb/rule) on the left sidebar.
2. At the top of the page on the right, select **Guangzhou** for **Region** and select **default** in the **Event Bus** drop-down list.
  - The Tencent Cloud service event bus collects monitoring and audit events generated by Tencent Cloud services in all regions. It is created in Guangzhou region by default and cannot be deleted. 
  - Select **Event Bus** on the left sidebar. In the event bus list, click **default**, and you can see that the **default** event bus already contains TencentDB for Redis. For detailed directions, see [Tencent Cloud Service Event Source](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46250).

5. (Optional) To convert the data format, select **Enable data conversion** to enter the event transformation page as shown below. Configure the data conversion formats and fields according to the parameter descriptions in the following table and click **OK** to start parsing the data. After data parsing is completed, set the filter rule and data processing method. For detailed directions, see [Configuring Data Conversion](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46247).
> ? EventBridge provides simple data processing capabilities. After you pass in data and configuration items to EventBridge, EventBridge formats the data and distributes the structured data obtained after processing to downstream targets, creating a bridge between data sources and data processing systems.
