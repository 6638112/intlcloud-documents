Standard Edition can be your self-created Redis Standalone Edition, master/replica mode, or TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Standard Architecture). This document describes the compatibility issues in migrating data from Redis Standard Edition to TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture).

## [Compatibility Description](id:jrxsm)
TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) adopts the cluster architecture consisting of Tencent Cloud's proprietary proxy and Redis Community Cluster Edition, which is 100% compatible with Redis Community Cluster Edition commands.

The most challenging problem in migrating data from Standard Edition to Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) is the command compatibility with usage specifications of Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture). You need to pay attention to the following usage specification issues:

### Multikey operation
TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) uses the hash algorithm to distribute keys to 16,384 slots. For more information on the principle, please see [Redis Cluster Specification](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
- Redis Community Cluster Edition: it does not support any cross-slot multikey access commands.
- TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture): it supports cross-slot multikey access of the `MGET`, `MSET`, and `DEL` commands. This mainly works by using Tencent Cloud's proprietary proxy to implement aggregated command computing among multiple nodes.
- Hash tag: in your business, keys that need to engage in multikey computing can be aggregated into the same slot through a hash tag. For more information on how to use hash tags, please see [Redis Cluster Specification](https://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
- Cross-slot command list:

### Support for Lua
- Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) supports Lua commands, but cross-slot access to keys in Lua scripts is not supported.
- The `KEY` parameter must be passed in for the `EVAL` and `EVALSHA` commands; otherwise, they cannot be executed.
- The subcommands `LOAD`, `FLUSH`, `KILL`, and `EXIST` of `SCRIPT` will be distributed to all master nodes in the cluster through the proxy.
```
> eval "return {KEYS[1],KEYS[2],ARGV[1],ARGV[2]}" 2 key1 key2 first second
1) "key1"
2) "key2"
3) "first"
4) "second"
```
>?The `key1` and `key2` parameters must be passed in when you use Lua.

### Transaction support
- Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) supports transactions, but cross-slot access to keys in transactions is not supported.
- You need to first run the `watch key` command and then the `multi` and `exec` commands in the current version. This operation will be optimized in future versions to eliminate need to run `watch key` first.

### [Custom commands](id:zdyml)
Through VIP encapsulation, TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (cluster architecture) provides a user experience in cluster mode comparable to the standard edition, making it much easier for use in different scenarios. To increase the transparency to OPS, custom commands can be used. Access to each node in the cluster is supported by adding a parameter "node ID" on the right of the original command parameter list, such as `COMMAND arg1 arg2 ... [node ID]`. The node ID can be obtained through the `cluster nodes` command or in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis).

### Client access method
We recommend you use a Standard Edition (e.g., [Jedis](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/7043) but not JedisCluster) client to access TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture), as this access method is more efficient and simpler. You can also access through cluster clients, such as JedisCluster.

### Codis compatibility
TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) is 100% compatible with Codis Server commands with no modification to your business required. You can use DTS to quickly migrate data to TencentDB for Redis, which has the following advantages over Codis:
- Compatibility with more versions. Codis supports only Redis 3.2 or below, while TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) supports Redis 4.0 and 5.0 and will be continuously updated in sync with the Redis Community.
- Compatibility with more commands. Codis does not support blocking commands such as `BLPOP` and `SUBSCRIBE`.
- If a big key occurs in data migration with Codis, the service may become unavailable. In contrast, TencentDB for Redis supports lossless expansion with no fear for big keys.

## Compatibility Check
Currently, no tools can be used to exactly determine whether there will be compatibility problems in data migration from Standard Edition to Cluster Edition. You can use the following two tools to evaluate the compatibility before migration. We recommend you perform static evaluation, dynamic evaluation, and business verification before migration to ensure that data can be smoothly migrated.

### Static evaluation
1. Download the [cluster_migrate_online_check.py static verification tool](https://redis-doc-2020-1254408587.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/cluster_migrate_check.py) and use it to run the `info commandstats` command to check whether Standard Edition has ever executed cross-slot commands in order to determine whether there is compatibility problem.
```
Usage:
./cluster_migrate_check.py host port password 
```
>?Enter the corresponding Redis Standard Edition information for `host`, `port`, and `password`.
2. Check whether each item can pass as instructed in [Compatibility Description](#jrxsm) above.

### Dynamic evaluation
Download the [cluster_migrate_online_check dynamic verification tool](https://redis-doc-2020-1254408587.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/cluster_migrate_online_check) and use it to simulate the execution of the `psync` command on the client so as to sync incremental data from Standard Edition to the TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) in real time. By performing real-time sync, you can check whether there is compatibility problem in write commands. This tool cannot test the compatibility of read commands.

The steps are as follows:
1. Activate TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis).
2. Use the tool to sync data from Standard Edition to TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) in real time.
3. After a period of verification (such as 6 or 24 hours), if the tool does not report any errors, the write commands do not have compatibility problems; otherwise, you can get the information of incompatible commands in the error message.
```
Usage:
./cluster_migrate_online_check srcip:srcport srcpasswd dstip:dstport dstpasswd 
Environment variable parameters:
export logout=1  // It is used to print command in the console, which is disabled by default
export pipeline = 2000  // Number of concurrent pipelines, which is 1,000 by default
```
>?
>- `srcip:srcport`: Redis Standard Edition address information, which is required.
>- `dstip:dstport`: TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) address information, which is optional. If it is left empty, the tool can be used as a monitor.
4. Check whether each item can pass as instructed in [Compatibility Description](#jrxsm) above.

### Business verification
To ensure successful data migration, we recommend you test the business in the test environment. You can connect the business in the testing environment to the TencentDB for Redis Memory Edition (Cluster Architecture) and confirm whether all features can work properly before data migration.

## Migrating Data Online with DTS
- For detailed directions, please see [Migration with DTS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31941).

## Self-created Instance Migration Failure
-  The `client-output-buffer-limit` parameter value is too small. We recommend you set it to 512 MB or 1,024 MB by running the following command:
```
config set client-output-buffer-limit "slave 1073741824 1073741824 600"
```
- Parameters have not been passed in for the `EVAL` command.
