## Network Overview
Tencent Cloud offers [VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215) (recommended) and classic network environments. A VPC is a logically isolated network space that can be customized in Tencent Cloud. Similar to the traditional network run in an IDC, a VPC is where your Tencent Cloud service resources are managed, such as [Cloud Virtual Machine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/495), [Cloud Load Balancer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/524), and [TencentDB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/5147).
For the differences between VPC and classic network, please see [VPC and Classic Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/35505).
For common operations on VPCs and subnets, please see [Managing VPC and Subnet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805).
