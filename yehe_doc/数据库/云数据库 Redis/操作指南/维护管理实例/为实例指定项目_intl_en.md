## Operation Scenarios
TencentDB for Redis supports assigning instances to different projects for easier management. Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects.
>?
>- Read-only instances and disaster recovery instances are associated instances of the master instance and should be in the same project as the master instance.
>- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.
