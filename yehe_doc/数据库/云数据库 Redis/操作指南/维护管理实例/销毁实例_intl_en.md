## Overview
Based on your business needs, you can manually terminate pay-as-you-go instances.
- After a pay-as-you-go instance is terminated, it will be moved to the TencentDB recycle bin and retained there for 3 days. During the retention period, the instance cannot be accessed but can be restored.

After an instance is terminated, once its status has changed to **Isolated** or **To be deleted**, it will no longer incur fees.
>!
>- After the instance is terminated, all data will be cleared and cannot be recovered. Please be sure to back up your data first before submitting a termination task.
>- When the instance is terminated, its IP resources will be released simultaneously.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis), locate the desired instance in the instance list, and select **More** > **Terminate** in the **Operation** column.
2. In the pop-up window, confirm that everything is correct and click **Terminate**.
3. After the termination, you will be redirected to the [instance recycle bin](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis/recycle), where you can **Start** or **Eliminate** the isolated instance.
