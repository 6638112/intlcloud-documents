## Memory Edition Engine
The Memory Edition engine provides a native Redis experience and supports a myriad of scenarios. It supports both Redis standard and cluster deployment architectures to meet the requirements of different business scenarios.

Editions supported by the Memory Edition engine include:
 - [Memory Edition (standard architecture)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/239/31959): when the number of replicas is greater than 0, data is synced between the master node and the replica nodes (slaves) in real time. When the master node fails, automatic failover will be performed in a matter of seconds, and a replica node will take over the business in an imperceptible manner. The master/slave architecture guarantees high availability of system services and provides 0.25–64 GB of storage capacity.
 - [Memory Edition (cluster architecture)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/18336): a cluster instance uses a distributed architecture, which allows flexible selection of shard quantity, shard capacity, and replica quantity and enables scaling imperceptible to the business. It provides 2 GB–8 TB of storage capacity and a performance of tens of millions of QPS.
