## Operation Scenarios 
This document describes how to modify the table quota in the TcaplusDB Console.

## Prerequisites
You have created a table. For more information, please see [Creating Table](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1016/32715).

## Directions
1. Enter the [Table List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcaplusdb/table) page, select the target table and click **Expand** in the "Operation" column, or select multiple tables and click **Batch Expand** at the top.
2. In the pop-up dialog box, determine the capacity, reserved read, and reserved write, and click **Confirm** to submit your request.
>Table expansion is to modify the table quota. After the modification, the backend will automatically reserve enough resources for the table and expand it automatically when the traffic of access to the table increases.
