## About Private Deployment

Due to the high complexity of CODING DevOps, installation will require professional services support. Our team will help you engage our certified service providers after procurement.

The standard version of the private deployment process is as follows:
1. Requirements research: organize project requirements research, participate in implementation information collection, technical requirements communication, identify delivery content, confirm project implementation team, prepare relevant human resources and external support experts according to the work content and delivery plan of the project specification.
2. Program design: According to the actual technical requirements of the system and the business requirements of each sub-system in the research, prepare and submit the Project Implementation Plan to the buyer in accordance with the specification requirements. After that, the project team will review the plan, and it will be formally effective after the review is approved and signed by both parties.
3. Deployment and implementation: According to the product configuration, carry out the installation and debugging of the software on the server side, including initialization of data, conversion and import of important data from the original system, installation of front and backend software, and adjustment of configuration parameters.
