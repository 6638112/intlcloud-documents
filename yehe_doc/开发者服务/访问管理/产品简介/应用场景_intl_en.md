## Use Cases
### Refined access control for resources

Grant resource management permissions to sub-users.
You can create users or roles in CAM and assign them separate security credentials (console login passwords, TencentCloud API keys, etc.) or request temporary credentials for them to access Tencent Cloud resources. You can also manage permissions to control the operations users and roles can perform and the resources they can access.

### Single sign-on to Tencent Cloud

Users with external Tencent Cloud roles can access Tencent Cloud resources.
You can use your existing authentication system through CAM to grant your employees and services access permissions to Tencent Cloud services and resources. Tencent Cloud supports federated authentication based on SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0) to implement interconnection with your organizational account systems on a private network.

### Multi-factor authentication for improved account security

Strengthen your security with an additional layer of protection 
We currently support two authentication methods: (hardware/virtual) MFA device authentication and mobile verification code. Depending on the configuration, a user may be required to enter a valid 6-digit authentication code to verify their identity and device environment before logging in or performing sensitive operations.
