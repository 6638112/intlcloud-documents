Cloud Access Management (CAM) is a web-based Tencent Cloud service that helps you securely manage and control access to your Tencent Cloud resources.

When you [sign up for Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985), the generated account is the root account, which has the management permission for all resources under it.
If you need other users to help you manage the Tencent Cloud resources under your account, you can create, manage, and terminate users (groups) in CAM and use identity and policy management features to control their access to your resources.
