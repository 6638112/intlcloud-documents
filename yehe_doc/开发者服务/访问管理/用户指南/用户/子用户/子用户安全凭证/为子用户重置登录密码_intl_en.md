If you need to set a new password for the sub-user, you can do so in the following two ways:
    - If you select **Auto-generate password** in **Access Password**, the system will automatically generate a console login password. You can copy and save it. If needed, you can also click **Download .csv** to save the password.
    - If you select **Customize Password** in **Access Password**, enter the password you want to set as the sub-user's console login password.
 -  If you want the current user to reset their own password, you can select **Enforce Password Reset**. The sub-user will be required to reset their console login password the next time they log in.
