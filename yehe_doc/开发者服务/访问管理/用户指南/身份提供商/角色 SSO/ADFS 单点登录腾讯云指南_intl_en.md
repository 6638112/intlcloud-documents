## Overview
Microsoft Windows Server's Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is a new technology for authenticating users of multiple web applications during one session. Tencent Cloud supports identity federation with Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0). SAML 2.0 is an open standard used by many identity providers (IdPs). SAML 2.0-based federation can be used to integrate ADFS with Tencent Cloud. Then, federated single sign-on (SSO) can be implemented by using an ADFS account, and admins can authorize users that have their federated identity authenticated to log in to the Tencent Cloud console for resource management, eliminating the need to create a CAM sub-user for each employee in the organization.
## Prerequisites
