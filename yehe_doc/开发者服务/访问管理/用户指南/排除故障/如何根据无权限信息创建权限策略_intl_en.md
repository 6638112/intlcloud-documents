## Overview

This document describes how to create a permissions policy when you are prompted for permission but do not have any. After the permissions policy is created, the sub-account can manage resources under the root account within the new permission scope.

## Prerequisite

Your account is a root account or a sub-account with full read/write access (QcloudCamFullAccess).

## Directions

1. Log in to the CAM console and go to [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy). Click **Create Custom Policy**.
2. In the pop-up window, click **Create by Policy Generator** to go to the **Edit Policy** page.
3. On the **Edit Policy** page, set the following information:[](id:3)
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/1362279f76ed167f3f082d4e8b8a2474.png)
   - **Effect** (required): Select **Allow** or **Deny**. In this example, select **Allow**.
   - **Service** (required): Select the product by short name to authorize. In this example, it will be `cvm` referenced in the operation field in the error information.
   - **Action** (required): Select the action to authorize. In this example, select `RebootInstances` corresponding to the `operation` field in the error information.
   - **Resource** (required): For products that don't support resource-level authorization, you can only select all resources as the authorization granularity. For products that support resource-level authorization, you can select a specific resource. To do so, click **Add a 6-segment resource description** and enter the resource prefix and resource. In this example, the error message is for a specific resource, so you need to authorize it: Select the specific resource, click **Add a 6-segment resource description**, and then you can directly copy the prefix and resource in `qcs:id/0:cvm:ap-guangzhou:uin/10***6:instance/ins-arh4gyp2` and paste them.
   - **Condition** (required): Set the condition for the sub-accountâ€™s authorization to take effect. `key` indicates the condition key, `ope`, the operator, and `value`, the condition value. In this example, `key` is `qcs:request_tag`, `ope` is `for_all_value:string_equal`, and `value` is `server&1024","a&b"`.
4. Click **Next** to go to the **Associate Users/User Groups** page.
5. On the **Associate Users/User Groups** page, add the policy name (automatically generated by the console) and description.
> ? 
>- The policy name is `policygen` by default. The suffix number is generated based on the creation date. This is customizable.
>- The description corresponds to the service and action selected in [Step 3](#3). You can modify it as needed.
> 
6. Click **Complete** to complete the custom policy creation.
7. Authorize the sub-account as instructed in [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602). After successful authorization, the sub-account will be granted the required permission, and the error will be fixed.
