## Overview
This document describes how to create a policy to resolve a fault according to the fault report. After the fault is resolved, the sub-account will be able to manage the resources of the root account within the scope of the newly configured permissions.

## Example
When a sub-account associated with the `QcloudCVMReadOnlyAccess ` policy attempts to reinstall a CVM instance, the following error is reported:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/594257635b42ada32e7d497e1d162b2b.png)
If you want to authorize the sub-account to proceed with this operation, you can create and associate a custom policy according to this error message.

## Directions
1. Log in to the CAM console, enter the [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy) page, and click **Create Custom Policy**.
2. In the selection window that pops up, click **Create by Policy Generator** to enter the **Edit Policy** page.
3. On the **Edit Policy** page, set the following information:[](id:3)
> - Effect (required): select whether the operation is allowed. In this example, select "Allow".
> - Service (required): select the product based on the abbreviation to authorize. In this example, it is **CVM** corresponding to `cvm` in the `operation` field of the error message.
> - Action (required): select the operation to authorize. In this example, select **ResetInstance** corresponding to the `operation` field of the error message.
>- Resource (required): for products that don't support resource-level authorization, you can only select all resources as the authorization granularity. For products that support resource-level authorization, you can select a specific resource. To do so, click **Add a six-segment resource description** and enter the resource prefix and resource. In this example, the error message is for a specific resource, so you need to authorize it: select the specific resource, click **Add a six-segment resource description**, and then you can directly copy the prefix and resource in `qcs:id/1158313:cvm:ap-guangzhou:uin/2159973417:instance/instance/ins-esuithv2` and paste them.
> - Condition (optional): set the conditions that must be met for the permission to take effect, such as a specified access IP. In this example, leave it empty.

4. Click **Next** to enter the **Associate Users/User Groups** page.
5. On the **Associate Users/User Groups** page, add the policy name (automatically generated by the console) and description.
>?  
> - The policy name is `policygen` suffixed with the creation time by default, which is customizable.
> - The policy description corresponds to the service and operations selected in [step 3](#3). You can modify them as needed.
6. Click **Done** to complete the custom policy creation.
7. Authorize the sub-account as instructed in [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602). After authorization, the sub-account will be granted the needed permission, and the fault will be resolved.
