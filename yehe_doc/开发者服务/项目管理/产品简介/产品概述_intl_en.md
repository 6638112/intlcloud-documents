## Empowering Your Team with Cloud Collaboration[](#CODING)

CODING Project Management (CODING-PM) is a sub-product of [CODING DevOps](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/products/coding-pm). A ** project** forms the smallest unit of CODING DevOps practices. You can use it as a fundamental tool for visualizing and controlling project progress. Merge requests can be associated with issues and bugs assigned to specific assignees. CODING **Project Collaboration** is the scheduling center for all issues. Teams can choose from **[Scrum Agile Project Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1133/44754)** and **[Classic Project Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1133/44744)** as needed. In CODING, all collaboration takes place on the cloud, facilitating the assignment and processing of tasks. Your team will be able to collaborate closely and address current and future challenges, improving productivity and delivery efficiency.

## Feature Overview[](#intro)

### Iteration[](#iterations)

Based on your team's development performance, you can divide development into iterations, each lasting two to three weeks, and use the planning feature to add requirements or bugs to the iterations. After an iteration begins, you can check its details and progress on the Iteration Overview page and view its requirements, tasks, and bugs in the Issue List.

### Requirement management[](#requirements)

A **requirement** refers to a software feature that users need in order to solve a certain problem or achieve a certain goal. You can create requirements, break down requirements and tasks, and process requirements. When creating a requirement, you can set its basic information, including the priority, due date, and category, and assign the requirement. Larger requirements can be broken down into smaller sub-requirements. To break down and assign development tasks, create tasks for a requirement or associate tasks with requirements.

### Task management[](#tasks)

A **task** refers to a specific activity carried out to implement a certain requirement. You can create tasks, view the task list, and process tasks. When creating a task in Project Collaboration, you can set its basic information, including the priority, due date, and description, and assign the task.

### Bug management[](#bugs)

A **bug** refers to a failure to meet an initially defined business requirement. You can report bugs, view the bug list, and process bugs. When creating a bug, you can set its basic information, including the priority, due date, and category, and assign the bug. The processing status of a bug is the stage in the bug's lifecycle and is used to organize and track the bug.

### Custom Fields and Workflows[](#customize)

Teams can customize fields and workflows for requirements, tasks, and bugs of a project to cater to their specific needs. By defining global fields and statuses, they can ensure consistent definitions and efficient collaboration across projects and departments.

### Wiki and File[](#wiki)

- **Wiki management:** Wiki supports Markdown and allows you to manage and compare versions, and expand to multiple levels. Project members can author and collaborate on files more efficiently, accumulating team knowledge. You can also share file links and generate a static website easily.
- **File management:** In the project file center, you can upload, download, preview, share, and delete files, and collaborate on them. Changelogs and earlier versions of files are available, allowing you to view and download previous file versions. Besides, you can view Excel, PowerPoint, Word, and PDF files and edit TXT and Markdown files online.


## Benefits[](#characteristics)

### Efficient cloud collaboration[](#collaboration)

Without downloading any software, everyone in your team can collaborate on projects using a browser. Log in whenever and wherever and use CODING-PM right out of the box; use the DevOps toolchain for the entire project process, manage your software development and app release lifecycle, and collaborate closely with your team; secure your team's digitalized assets with the powerful cloud-native infrastructure.

### Diversified management modes[](#management)

Two mainstream modes are available:
- **Scrum agile project management:** Suited to iteration-based teams adopting agile methodologies. You can manage requirement pools, and plan and track iterations.
- **Classic project management:** Suited to plan-driven teams focusing on plans and their delivery. You can manage development plans, requirements, and tasks.


### Integrated collaboration features[](#integration)

CODING-PM has a rich set of features for managing iterations, requirements, tasks, and bugs. This enables seamless collaboration between different roles in a team such as the product managers, development engineers, testers, and operations engineers. Team members can break down and associate tasks, estimate the time needed to complete tasks, discuss requirements and tasks, accurately control the issue progress of each iteration, and achieve sustainable rapid iteration.

### In-depth association of project resources[](#project)

CODING-PM can associate resources and related files/Wiki documents across project requirements, tasks, and bugs, which makes the relationship among all issues traceable and locatable, and quickly brings teams up to speed. Issues can also be associated with merge requests in code repositories, which are at the core of development tasks, allowing code reviews to account for the associated requirements or tasks.

### Visualized data reports[](#visualization)

CODING-PM offers visualized data such as Gantt charts for issue statuses and data reports, helping team members monitor the progress and development trends of issues across iterations at any time, analyze problems, and provide solid evidence to help the team manager make decisions, quickly adjust project expectations and plans, and bring the progress of agile collaboration under control.

### Team knowledge base[](#repository)

CODING-PM supports the storage, online preview, download, sharing, and sorting of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, video, and other files. Wiki allows online editing and storage of files in tree structures. An earlier version can be saved as a file or Wiki document, allowing all departments to collaborate on, manage, and trace file resources, and build a team knowledge base.

### Custom workflow[](#workflow)

CODING-PM provides a custom workflow feature where development teams can design the transition processes for requirements and tasks as needed. This helps standardize management and customize workflows tailored to your team.

### Diversified permission management[](#permission)

CODING-PM supports permission configuration for team member management and project member management. It can group team members by role, assign group permissions separately and customize permissions of each group by feature to build an efficient permission management system for your team.
