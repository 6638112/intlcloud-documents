CODING-PM is suited to development teams with project management needs or agile development practices. It boasts the following benefits:

### Integrated collaboration features
CODING-PM has a rich set of features for managing iterations, requirements, tasks, and bugs. This enables seamless collaboration between different roles in a team such as the product managers, development engineers, testers, and operations engineers. Team members can break down and associate tasks, estimate the time needed to complete tasks, discuss requirements and tasks, accurately control the issue progress of each iteration, and achieve sustainable rapid iteration.

### Two development modes
CODING-PM offers a Scrum mode for agile teams and a classic mode for traditional project management. Teams can choose the desired mode that suits their project management needs. Agile development covers the entire software process. Iterations and incremental software development are at its core. But traditional project management is based on plans and centered on requirements, resources, and time. Personnel assignments and scheduling take place after requirements are established.

### Custom workflow
CODING-PM provides a custom workflow feature where development teams can design the transition processes for requirements and tasks as needed. This helps standardize management and customize workflows tailored to your team.

### Diversified permission management
CODING-PM supports permission configuration for team member management and project member management. It can group team members by role, assign group permissions separately and customize permissions of each group by feature to build an efficient permission management system for your team.

### Team knowledge base
CODING-PM supports the storage, online preview, download, sharing, and sorting of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, video, and other files. Wiki allows online editing and storage of files in tree structures. An earlier version can be saved as a file or Wiki document, allowing all departments to collaborate on, manage, and trace file resources, and build a team knowledge base.

### In-depth association of project resources
CODING-PM can associate resources and related files/Wiki documents across project requirements, tasks, and bugs, which makes the relationship among all issues traceable and locatable, and quickly brings teams up to speed.

### Visualized data reports
CODING-PM offers visualized data such as Gantt charts for issue statuses and data reports, helping team members monitor the progress and development trends of issues across iterations at any time, analyze problems, and provide solid evidence to help the team manager make decisions, quickly adjust project expectations and plans, and bring the progress of agile collaboration under control.
