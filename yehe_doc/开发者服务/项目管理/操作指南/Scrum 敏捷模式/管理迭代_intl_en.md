## Open Project

2. Click <img src ="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d94a8e60dd3a41d0af07d72ae0e9d70e.png" style ="margin:0"> in the upper-right corner to open the project list page and click a project icon to open the project.

## Function Overview

Based on your team's development performance, you can divide development into iterations, each lasting two to three weeks, and use **Pending Planning** to add issues to the iterations. After an iteration starts, you can view all issues in the current iteration in All Issues, or view the iteration details and progress in **Overview and Statistics**, so as to ensure on-time delivery.

## Create Iterations[](#create)

1. On the **Project Collaboration** page, select **Create Iteration** in the lower-right corner of **Pending Planning** to quick create an iteration.

## Plan Iteration Issues[](#plan)

Plan Iteration allows you to add issues to or remove issues from the current iteration.

1. If you select **Create and Plan** when creating an iteration, you will enter the **Pending Planning** page. You can drag reviewed issues from the **backlog** to the current iteration, or drag issues out from the iteration to the **backlog**. You can also click **Create Issue** at the bottom of the iteration to add an issue to it.

1. Alternatively, select an iteration on the Iterations page to enter its details page, and click **Plan Iteration** in the upper-right corner to go to **Pending Planning**, and then perform the same operations described in the previous step.

1. You can also **drag issues in batches to add them to an iteration**. Press and hold **⌘** and **left-click** (depending on the operating system you use) to select multiple issues. Selected issues are highlighted in blue. Drag the selection to add them to the specified iteration at the same time.

## Iteration Settings[](#setting)

The **Iterations** page displays all iterations that have not started or are in progress. All project members can view the development process and progress.

Click an iteration to enter its details page. The **issues** listed include all planned issues in the current iteration. You can search for specific issues with one or more filters, or sort them by different fields. For more information, see [Filter Issues](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1133/44769). In addition, you can switch between Tree View, Tile View, and Kanban View. For more information, see [Manage Issue Views](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1133/44773).

## Complete Iteration[](#end)

Iterations are sorted by successive phases: "Not started", "In progress", and "Completed". Iterations cannot be reverted to the previous phase.

1. By default, the status of a newly created iteration is **Not started**. If issues in the iteration have been planned, click **Start Iteration** in the upper-right corner of the iteration details page. The default start time for the iteration is the start date configured when the iteration was created. If no start date was configured, the current time will be used as the start time, which you can modify as needed. After verifying the details, click **Confirm and Start*. The status of the iteration will change to **In progress**.

1. When the iteration is **In progress**, you can decide whether to complete it depending on the issue completion status or iteration end time. Click **Complete Iteration** in the upper-right corner of the iteration details page, and the status of the iteration will change to **Completed**.
