## Function Overview

Epics are large functions or features. Generally, it takes multiple iterations to fully deliver an epic. The requirements and tasks under an agile epic can be flexibly adjusted based on the customer feedback and the team's development progress.

In **Project Collaboration**, an epic can be broken down into requirements and tasks of smaller granularity, which are then added in iterations for completion. For example, if Requirement B is too large to be completed in one iteration, you can break it down into requirements B1, B2, and B3. Since Requirement A and Requirement B are closely associated, they can be included together in Epic 1. In this way, large requirements are divided into smaller requirements, and requirements of the same business are organized into the same epic, so as to achieve quick iterations and frequent releases, until a more complete form of the product is reached.

### Add issues[](#add)

The purpose of creating issues in an epic is to break down an epic into smaller user stories, requirements, tasks, or bugs. Under an epic, you can create multiple issues, and the issues can also be broken down. On the epic details page, you can view, create, associate, disassociate, and delete an issue.

## Epic Status Transition[](#status)

After creating an epic, configuring it, and breaking it down, the team can start the epic. An epic goes through three statuses: **Not started**, **In progress**, and **Completed**. You can change the epic status in the **epic list** or epic details page.
