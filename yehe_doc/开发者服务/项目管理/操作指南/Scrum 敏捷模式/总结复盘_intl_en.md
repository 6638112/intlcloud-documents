## Function Overview

In a complete agile development process, teams conduct iteration planning meetings, daily stand-up meetings, and retrospective meetings to discuss, evaluate, and review all issues in the process. During these meetings, team members can inspect the completion status of issues, calculate the objective achievement rate, summarize what went well and shortcomings in the current iteration, and list executable tasks for the next iteration, so as to improve the development efficiency of the entire team.

All content of the meetings can be recorded in Wiki documents in CODING. CODING Wiki is a shared knowledge base for team members to communicate, record the project execution details, and display the current project status. As the documents support additions, deletions, and changes, project members can write and collaborate on documentation more effectively, facilitating information query, review, and accumulation. For more information, see [Document Management - Wiki](https://help.coding.net/docs/document/wiki.html).

As teams may not face the exact same problems, agile practices are actually iterations as well. The problems summarized in every retrospective meeting will become invaluable experience for your team.
