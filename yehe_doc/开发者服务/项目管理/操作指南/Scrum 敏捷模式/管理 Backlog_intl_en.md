## Open Project

2. Click <img src ="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d94a8e60dd3a41d0af07d72ae0e9d70e.png" style ="margin:0"> in the upper-right corner to open the project list page and click a project icon to open the project.

## Function Overview

Once you have entered **Project Collaboration**, in **Pending Planning**, you will see all incomplete issues that have not been added to an iteration in the **backlog**. You can create issues here, or directly drag issues to change their sequential order.

In agile development, we recommend that you follow the standard process: The product owner adds issues and adjusts their priority in the backlog, and then the team reviews the issues with higher priorities in the backlog before an iteration starts. After an iteration is created, add issues to the iteration and then you can start it.

### Issues to be reviewed[](#be-assessed)

The pending review area in the **backlog** is generally suited to projects that require large-scale requirement pools to be maintained. Issues to be reviewed are listed in the pending review area. Once reviewed, issues can be moved to the reviewed area for sorting and iteration planning.
1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Project Collaboration** > **Agile Features**, and then enable **Backlog Pending Review Area**.

2. Once enabled, the **backlog** will be divided into **reviewed** and **pending review** areas. Issues can be dragged between the two areas to indicate whether they have been reviewed or not. You can also drag the dividing line to move issues in bulk into the reviewed area.
