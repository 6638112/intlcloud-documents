## Feature Overview

If Issue A is impeded by the progress of Issue B, Issue B can be defined as a **block relationship** of Issue A. **Block relationships** are supported for all CODING Project Collaboration issues (requirements, tasks, and bugs) and are divided into pre-issues and post-issues.
- Pre-issue: An issue that needs to be completed before the current issue starts.
- Post-issue: The current issue needs to be completed before a post-issue can start.

The following example uses a requirement to demonstrate how you can configure and view **block relationships**.

## Configure Block Relationship[](#configure)

1. On the issue details page, select **`···`** at the top and click **Block Relationship** in the menu.
