## Feature Overview[](#intro)

In Project Collaboration, filters are available on the list pages of **Pending Planning** (Scrum agile project management mode), **Plans** (classic project management mode), **Iterations**, and All Issues, helping team members query and sort issues by specified conditions. CODING provides a system filter and a custom filter. The former is unable to be modified or deleted. The following shows how to use and customize filters in **All Issues**.

## Filter Issues[](#filter)

The filter on the **All Issues** page supports a combination of multiple field conditions, or fuzzy search by "Title" and "Description" of issues in the **search box**.

## Configure Default Filter[](#filter)

1. The filter on the **All Issues** page has a built-in system filter, which cannot be modified or deleted. You can change the search conditions in the dropdown menu on the right of the filter.
