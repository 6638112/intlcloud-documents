3. The template includes **title** (required), **description**, **assignee**, **status**, **priority** and **due time**. After you fill in the template, upload an Excel/CSV file.

>!Issue fields are used to describe the current status, due date, assignee, priority, and other information of this issue. If required fields are preset in the project, this rule is ignored during the issue import; if default values are preset for the fields in the project, they are auto-filled during the issue import. For more information, see [Custom Issue Fields](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1133/44767).
4. Check the import result.
After the import is complete, you will be notified by a prompt message on the import page or system notification. If the import fails, download the error log as instructed, and import again after changes.
