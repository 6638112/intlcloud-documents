In essence, build tasks follow the processes and steps defined in configuration files. CODING Continuous Integration (CODING-CI) is fully compatible with Jenkinsfiles. Configuration files composed in the text editor can be run as long as they follow the syntax specifications of Jenkinsfiles.

Open a project, click "Continuous Integration" on the left, and then click "Settings" on a build plan.
