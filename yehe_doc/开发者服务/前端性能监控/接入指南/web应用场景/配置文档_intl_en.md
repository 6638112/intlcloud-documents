## Sample Code

### api.retCodeHandler[](id:exp1)
If the backend returns the following data:
```json
{
    body: {
        code: 200,
        retCode: 0,
        data: {
            // xxx
        }
    }
}

```
If your business requires that if the `code` is not 200 or `retCode` is not 0, the request is incorrect. To meet this requirement, you can simply configure as follows:
```javascript
new Aegis({
    // xxx
    reportApiSpeed: true, // You need to enable two speed test APIs; otherwise, no return code will be reported
    reportAssetSpeed: true,
    api: {
        retCodeHandler(data, url, xhr) { 
            // `data` is a string. If you want to get an object, you need to manually parse it
            // `url` is the request URL
            // The complete backend `xhr` response can be obtained through `xhr.response`
            try {
                data = JSON.parse(data)
            } catch(e) {}
            return {
                isErr: data.body.code !== 200 || data.body.retCode !== 0,
                code:  data.body.code
            }
        }
    }
})
```

### api.resourceTypeHandler
If the API is `http://example.com/test-api` and the returned `Content-Type` is `text/html`, Aegis will consider that the content returned by the API is a static resource. In this case, you can correct the judgment as follows:
```javascript
new Aegis({
    reportApiSpeed: true, // You need to enable two speed test APIs; otherwise, no return code will be reported
    reportAssetSpeed: true,
    api: {
        resourceTypeHandler(url) {
            if (url?.indexOf('http://example.com/test-api') != -1) {
                return 'fetch';
            }
        }
    }
})
```

### reportApiSpeed.urlHandler[](id:exp2)
If your page has RESTful APIs such as:  
`www.example.com/user/1000`
`www.example.com/user/1001`

You need to aggregate the following APIs when reporting the speed test data:
```javascript
new Aegis({
    // xxx
    reportApiSpeed: {
        urlHandler(url, payload) {
            if ((/www\.example\.com\/user\/\d*/).test(url)) {
                return 'www.example.com/user/:id';
            }
            return url;
        }
    }
    // xxx
})
```

### pagePerformance.urlHandler[](id:exp3)
If your page has RESTful APIs such as:  
`www.example.com/user/1000`
`www.example.com/user/1001`

You need to aggregate the page addresses when reporting the page speed test data:
```javascript
new Aegis({
    // xxx
    pagePerformance: {
        urlHandler() {
            if ((/www\.example\.com\/user\/\d*/).test(window.location.href)) {
                return 'www.example.com/user/:id';
            }
        }
    }
    // xxx
})
```
