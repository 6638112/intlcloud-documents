This document describes how to use the page performance feature. It allows you to use performance change trend chart, page loading waterfall plot, region view, and other dimensions to analyze key page performance metrics, such as `firstScreenTime` and request response.

## Prerequisites
You have connected an application. For detailed directions, see [Application Connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1131/44496).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [RUM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/rum).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Page Performance**.
3. On the page performance page, you can view the page performance metrics.


### Performance view
It displays the change trends of key page performance metrics.
- You can click a legend above the chart to hide or show the corresponding data. ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/777c49ca905a01d5a5a451a5b79de832.png)
- You can display the trend for the specified time period or the past 14 days.
- You can drag the curve to display the FMP at a specific time point.
- You can mouse over the chart and scroll up and down to adjust its time span.

### Page loading waterfall plot
You can use the page loading waterfall plot to view the duration of each phase and optimize the page performance accordingly.
The complete page loading duration is the sum of the TCP connection, DNS query, SSL connection, TTFB, DOM parsing, and resource loading durations.

### Core Web Vitals
Core Web Vitals reflect user experience from perspectives of loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability, and grade pages into three levels of "Good", "Needs Improvement", and "Poor", helping you comprehensively optimize the user experience.
Core Web Vitals include three core basic metrics: LCP, FID, and CLS.

| Metric Acronym | Metric Name | Description | 
|---------|---------|---------|
| LCP | Largest Contentful Paint | It is the duration between when the user requests the website address and when the largest visible content element is rendered in the visible window. The element is usually an image, video, or a large block-level text element. | 
| FID | First Input Delay | It is the duration between when the user interacts with (clicks a link or button on) the page for the first time and when the browser responds to the interaction. The object of this metric is any interactive element that is clicked by the user for the first time. |
| CLS | Cumulative Layout Shift | It is the total score of all accidental layout shifts throughout the entire lifecycle of the page, which is between 0 and any positive number. 0 indicates that there are no shifts, and the higher the value, the greater the website layout shift. |

#### Metric level

| Metric Level | Description | 
|---------|---------|
| Good | The performance is good. | 
| Needs Improvement | The performance needs to be optimized. |
| Poor | The performance is poor. |

The following figure shows that your LCP is at the "Needs Improvement" level, and you can optimize the performance by improving the rendering of the largest visible content element such as image or video.

### Other views


| View Name | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Top underperformed pages view | It displays the top five pages with the poorest performance, including firstScreenTime, page loading duration, and day-over-day comparison, in order to help you understand the conditions of poorly performing pages and quickly find performance bottlenecks. |
| Network/Platform view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each network type/platform, such as 3G, 4G, and Wi-Fi networks as well as macOS, Windows, and iOS platforms. |
| ISP view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each ISP such as China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom. | 
| Region view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each region. | 
| Brand/Model view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each mobile phone brand/model. |
| Browser view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each browser. |
| Version view | It uses a pie chart to display the number of exceptions, percentage, and firstScreenTime of pages from each application version. You can use `new Aegis` to pass in `version` during application connection to customize the version information related to development. The SDK version is used by default. |
|ext1/ext2/ext3 views| They are custom views. You can customize their parameters passed in during reporting. For details, see [Connection Guide](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1131/44517).|


### Metric description

| Metric Name |Unit | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| First Meaningful Paint (FMP) | ms | It is the duration between when the user requests to open a new page and when the browser renders the first meaningful paint. |
| Complete page loading duration | ms | It is the duration between when the user requests to open a new page and when the browser completely renders the corresponding page.<br>Complete page loading duration = TCP connection + DNS query + SSL connection + TTFB + DOM parsing + resource loading durations |
| Time to First Byte (TTFB) | ms | It is the duration in milliseconds between when a page request is sent and when the first byte of the response data is received. |
| DOM Parse | ms | It is the DOM parsing duration. |
| DOM Ready | ms | It is the time it takes to completely load and parse the initial HTML document. |
| DNS | ms | It is the DNS query duration. |
| TCP | ms |	It is the TCP connection duration. |
|SSL | ms | It is the secure SSL connection duration. |
| Request response | ms | It is the request response duration. |
| Resource download | ms | It is the resource loading duration. |
|Content download | ms | It is the duration between when the browser receives the first byte and when it receives the last byte. |
