### Log Reporting
Frontend developers can get the information they need by reporting any kind of data to the RUM console, including general logs, custom events, and custom speed test data.

### Error Collection
RUM actively collects information about a wide variety of errors, including browser-based JavaScript code execution errors, API information errors, resource loading exceptions, and Promise exceptions.

### Performance Data
RUM offers a lot of page performance metrics, including FMP, TCP connection establishment time, time to first byte (TTFB), and SSL handshake time.

### Page View
RUM enables you to easily view the number of page views (PV) and unique visitors (UV) in various dimensions such as ISP, access source, and access region, so that you can stay up to date with and analyze user access in real time.

### Resource Speed Test
You can perform speed testing on your images and CDN resources, allowing you to analyze resource loading speed from multiple dimensions such as region, ISP, and browser.

### API Speed Test
RUM collects information about API calls from every page, including  API call time and status code statistics. In this way, you can analyze API performance from multiple dimensions such as region, ISP, and browser.

### Smart Alarm
Leveraging the capabilities of Tencent Cloud Montitor (CM), you can customize metrics and deliver instant, reliable alarms related to errors, page loading, and performance data.
