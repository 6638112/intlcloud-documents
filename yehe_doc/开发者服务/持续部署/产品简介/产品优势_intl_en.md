### Releasing various artifacts

Docker images, WAR packages, Helm packages, and software source code can all be configured as to-be-released artifacts in CODING-CD, which can seamlessly connect to CODING-CI and CODING-AR to implement a complete CI/CD process.

### Supporting multiple operating environments

Based on Spinnaker's infrastructure management capability, CODING-CD can connect to common runtime Ops systems and cloud native environments such as CVM, SCF, TKE, and Kubernetes.

### Flexible release process orchestration

With continuous deployment streamlined by the release process, CODING-CD makes it easy to control the release of applications with multiple microservices across different cluster environments (testing, pre-release, and production). It also supports process pre-orchestration, rollback, and more features.

### Powerful approval system

Predefined approval processes make the release process more stable and reliable. Different approval processes can be automatically selected based on different hierarchical levels involved in a release. Roles such as tester, product manager, and technical leader can be added to a release approval process as needed. Automated procedures and notification mechanism greatly improve the release efficiency.

### Static website service

As a key feature of CODING-CD, the service allows you to deploy the code or project files in your code repository as a static website, which supports binding custom domain names and automatic renewal of SSL/TLS certificates. You can also build personal blogs, corporate websites, and other simple websites.

### Extended ecosystem

The CODING-CD console is built on Spinnaker, an open-source project of the Continuous Delivery Foundation. Optimized based on Spinnaker's international open-source ecosystem, the console can seamlessly connect to upstream and downstream development processes in CODING, providing an out-of-the-box development experience.
