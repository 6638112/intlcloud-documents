## Scenario

This document describes how to use Terraform to manage resources created in the Tencent Cloud console.

## Directions

To take over an existing resource (for example, TencentDB for PostgreSQL alarm policy in this document) on Terraform, you only need to reflect its state in both the source and state files of Terraform.

### Getting the resource ID
1. Log in to the Cloud Monitor console and select **Alarm Configuration** > [**Alarm Policy**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/alarm2/policy) on the left sidebar.

2. Find and record the target policy ID as shown below: ![](https://staticintl.cloudcachetci.com/yehe/backend-news/Ukxf276_%E4%BC%81%E4%B8%9A%E5%BE%AE%E4%BF%A1%E6%88%AA%E5%9B%BE_20221220163754.png)


### Importing the resource file
1. Go to the Terraform working directory and run the following command to view the `main.tf` content.

   ``` bash
   tencent-cloud cat main.tf
   ```

   The following information will appear:

   ``` html
   resource "tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy" "policy" {}
   ```
2. Run the following command in the directory where the file is located to complete the initialization.

   ``` bash
   terraform init --upgrade
   ```

   The following information will appear:

   ``` html
   Initializing the backend...
   
   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding latest version of tencentcloudstack/tencentcloud...
   - Installing tencentcloudstack/tencentcloud v1.60.22...
   - Installed tencentcloudstack/tencentcloud v1.60.22 (signed by a HashiCorp partner, key ID 84F69E1C1BECF459)
   
   Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
   If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/plugins/signing.html
   
   Terraform has made some changes to the provider dependency selections recorded
   in the .terraform.lock.hcl file. Review those changes and commit them to your
   version control system if they represent changes you intended to make.
   
   Terraform has been successfully initialized!
   
   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
   should now work.
   
   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```
3. After the initialization is completed, run the following command to import resources into the state file.

   ``` html
   terraform import tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy policy-vor9w72r 
   ```

   The response is as follows:

   ``` bash
   âžœ  terraform import tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy policy-vor9w72r 
   
   tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy: Importing from ID "policy-vor9w72r"...
   tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy: Import prepared!
     Prepared tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy for import
   tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy: Refreshing state... [id=policy-vor9w72r]
   
   Import successful!
   
   The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in
   your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
   
   ```
4. Run the following command to view the state file.

   ``` html
   cat terraform.tfstate
   ```

   You can view the following resource information:

   ``` bash

           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   
   
   ```

### Updating the source file
1. Run the following command to print the resource information.

   ``` html
   terraform show
   ```

   The response is as follows:

   ``` bash
   # tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy:
   resource "tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy" "policy" {
       enable       = 1
       id           = "policy-vor9w72r"
       monitor_type = "MT_QCE"
       namespace    = "POSTGRESQL"
       notice_ids   = [
           "notice-l9ziyxw6",
       ]
       policy_name  = "PgSql"
       project_id   = 0
   
       conditions {
           is_union_rule = 0
   
           rules {
               continue_period  = 5
               description      = "cpu"
               is_power_notice  = 0
               metric_name      = "Cpu"
               notice_frequency = 86400
               operator         = "gt"
               period           = 60
               rule_type        = "STATIC"
               unit             = "%"
               value            = "90"
           }
       }
   
       event_conditions {
           continue_period  = 0
           description      = "HASwitch"
           is_power_notice  = 0
           metric_name      = "ha_switch"
           notice_frequency = 0
           period           = 0
       }
   }
   ```
2. Copy the resource code to the Terraform source file `tencentcloud.tf`. You need to delete any options that cannot be set, such as ID. Below is the content of the edited `tencentcloud.tf` file:

   ``` bash
   provider tencentcloud {}
   resource "tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy" "policy" {
     enable       = 1
   #  id           = "policy-vor9w72r"
     monitor_type = "MT_QCE"
     namespace    = "POSTGRESQL"
     notice_ids   = [
       "notice-l9ziyxw6",
     ]
     policy_name  = "PgSql"
     project_id   = 0
   
     conditions {
       is_union_rule = 0
   
       rules {
         continue_period  = 5
         description      = "cpu"
         is_power_notice  = 0
         metric_name      = "Cpu"
         notice_frequency = 86400
         operator         = "gt"
         period           = 60
         rule_type        = "STATIC"
         unit             = "%"
         value            = "90"
       }
     }
   
     event_conditions {
       continue_period  = 0
       description      = "HASwitch"
       is_power_notice  = 0
       metric_name      = "ha_switch"
       notice_frequency = 0
       period           = 0
     }
   }
   ```

### Verification

Run the following command for a refresh using the code and state file in the current working directory.
``` html
terraform plan
```

The following information is returned, showing that the resource has been successfully taken over by Terraform.
``` bash
tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy: Refreshing state... [id=policy-vor9w72r]

No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.
```

At this point, Terraform has taken over the resource. You can delete it with the `destroy` command or modify it just like the code. After modifying, for example, the alarm threshold, run the following command for an update.
``` bash
terraform plan
```

The following information is returned, showing that Terraform indicates that the alarm policy will be updated after value modification.
``` html
tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy: Refreshing state... [id=policy-vor9w72r]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  ~ update in-place

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy.policy will be updated in-place
  ~ resource "tencentcloud_monitor_alarm_policy" "policy" {
        id           = "policy-vor9w72r"
        # (6 unchanged attributes hidden)

      ~ conditions {
            # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)

          ~ rules {
              ~ value            = "90" -> "99"
                # (9 unchanged attributes hidden)
            }
        }

        # (1 unchanged block hidden)
    }

Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy.
```
