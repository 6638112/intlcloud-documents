This document describes how to create a file transfer task to test the speed of file upload/download and get the speed of application data transfer, which reflects the actual bandwidth fluctuations.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [CAT console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cat/probe/tasklist).
2. On the left sidebar, click **Tasks**.
3. Click **Create task** at the top of the **Tasks** page.
4. Configure the basic information as follows:
<table>
<tr>
<th>Configuration Item</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test mode</td>
<td>Select <b>Regular test</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Task type</td>
<td>Select <b>File transfer (upload/download)</b> on the PC or mobile.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test address</td>
<td>Enter the target web application address starting with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>.<br>For example:<br>1. Domain: http://www.tencent.com<br/>2. Domain and port: http://www.tencent.com:80<br/>Note: You need to enter the port when using <b>TCP</b> or <b>UDP</b> in <b>Ping monitoring</b>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test task name</td>
<td>Enter a custom test task name.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Test frequency</td>
<td>It can be <b>1 minute</b>, <b>5 minutes</b>, <b>10 minutes</b>, <b>15 minutes</b>, <b>30 minutes</b>, <b>60 minutes</b>, or <b>120 minutes</b>. For example, if you select <b>5 minutes</b>, each testing node will be tested once every five minutes.</td>
</tr>
</table>

5. Configure the testing node as follows:
  1. Select the method: You can select **Recommended location group** or **Custom location group** (the former contains common nodes).
  2. Select the location:
	- Availability testing nodes: Only network quality and API monitoring tasks are supported. This option is suitable for network quality monitoring, API availability monitoring, and hijacking and blocking detection.
	- Scenario-based testing nodes: This option is suitable for page user experience and streaming lag monitoring, availability testing under poor network conditions, CDN selection, and path optimization. It covers global IDC, PC, and mobile testing nodes.
     - Recommended testing node group: Commonly used and recommended testing nodes.
     - Custom testing node group: Select the region, node type, and testing node on the right box. Node types are as detailed below:
<table>
<tr>
	<th>Testing node Type</th>
	<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IDC</td>
<td>It is the testing node deployed on the PC to test the PC user experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LastMile</td>
<td>It is the testing node deployed on the end user's PC to test the end user's experience on the PC.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mobile</td>
<td>It is the location deployed on the mobile phone to test the mobile user experience.</td>
</tr>
</table>
 - My testing node group: You can select a common testing node group in **Scenario-based testing nodes** and click **Create testing node group** in the bottom-right corner. Then, you can directly select a common testing node you created from **My testing node group** when creating a task.

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="Suggestions for selection">
**IDC** and **LastMile** have different network environments, and the former is more stable than the latter.
- To test the business availability, you can select the more stable **IDC**.
- To check the access experience and network conditions of end users, we recommend you select **LastMile** or **Mobile** to simulate the user access to an application.

6. Configure the test parameters (optional) as follows:
**File upload:**

<tr>
<td> IP type</td>
<td>It can be <b>Auto</b>, <b>IPv4</b>, or <b>IPv6</b>.</td>
<td>Auto</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Upload method</td>
<td>It can be <b>POST</b> or <b>PUT</b>.</td>
<td>POST</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Download URL of the file to be uploaded</td>
<td>The specified file will be downloaded through the URL for the upload task. The file size should not exceed the set transferred file size.</td>
<td> -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>File MD5</td>
<td>It is optional. If it is not specified, the file to be uploaded will be automatically generated by the testing node.</td>
<td> -</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Transferred file size</td>
<td>Define the size of the file to be uploaded, which must be greater than 0 KB and smaller than or equal to 51,200 KB.</td>
<td>1,024 KB</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Custom host</td>
<td>It supports polling by IP or random monitoring. Separate IP addresses by comma.<br>For example: <ul style = "margin-bottom: 0px;"><li>IPv4: <code>192.168.2.1,192.168.2.5:img.a.com&#124;192.168.2.1?]:img.a.com&#124;</code></li><li>IPv6: <code>[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1][8080],[0:0:0:0:0:0:0:2][8081]:www.a.com|]</code></li></ul></td><td>-</td>
</tr>
