### Billing example

Suppose an advanced test task is performed every five minutes for two IDC testing nodes in the Chinese mainland. If it lasts 31 days in May, the duration will be 44,640 minutes = 31 (days) * 24 (hours) * 60 (minutes).

The Pro edition will be charged [2 * (44,640 / 5 )] * 0.0048 â‰ˆ 85.70 USD.

> ?Make sure that your account has a sufficient balance; otherwise, test tasks cannot run properly after two hours if your account has overdue payments.
