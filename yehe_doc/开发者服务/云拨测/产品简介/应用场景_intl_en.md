### Service quality optimization

CAT simulates global user access to services to get service quality metrics in various business scenarios (such as online video experience, ecommerce website performance, and API tests). Metrics are related to webpage performance, port latency, browser events, video lag, hijacking and tampering, and application errors. You can configure real-time alarms so that alarm notifications will be sent in case of metric exceptions, contributing to service quality optimization.

### Release verification

CAT verifies the availability and performance after system upgrade or new feature release. With the address of the tested business, it discovers experience issues in advance, such as failure to open the business site, time-consuming step, error rate, and slow running. In this way, issues are perceived before being reported by users, which delivers better user experience.

### CDN quality assessment

CAT proactively tests the CDN service quality and provides detailed data, for example, CDN performance comparison and CDN service quality, which provides a basis for CDN service fine-tuning and user experience optimization.

### Hijacking and tampering prevention

CAT sends alarms as soon as illegal hijacking behaviors such as domain hijacking, traffic hijacking, and page tampering are detected, facilitating your communication with ISPs and protecting your application traffic and brand image.

### Performance comparison

CAT tests the performance of product competitors to highlight its pros and cons in the industry, guiding the optimization and determining the optimization goal.

### IPv6 monitoring

CAT compares the performance and network connectivity metrics before and after transition from IPv4 to IPv6 in different regions.
