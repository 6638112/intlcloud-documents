### Rich location resources

 - End user's PC testing nodes: Covers over 200 regions in the Chinese mainland, over 50 regions outside the Chinese mainland, and over 200 ISPs.
 
Mobile monitoring network: Covers over 100 regions in the Chinese mainland and 150 IDCs in over 65 regions outside the Chinese mainland. Over 7,500 real phones are accessed over 4G.

### Non-intrusive monitoring

CAT leverages nationwide testing nodes to configure test tasks, get performance data during access, and display the data on the report platform, without your involvement. It perceives performance issues during user access in advance and supports comparative analysis for prompt tuning, better user experience, and stronger product competitiveness.

### Data visualization
CAT can monitor performance metrics for network quality, webpage performance, API monitoring, file transfer (upload/download), and audio/video experience monitoring scenarios and display them in visual charts.

### Flexible alarm service

CAT provides the custom alarm channel service and allows you to configure alarm triggers for multiple metrics. After setting the default alarm policy, you can customize the alarm recipient and sending channel. Then, an alarm notification will be pushed to the recipient upon problem occurrence, accelerating problem solving and mitigating the impact.
