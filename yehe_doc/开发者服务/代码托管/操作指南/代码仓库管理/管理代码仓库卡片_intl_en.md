This document describes how to manage code repository cards.

## Open Project

1. Log in to the CODING Console and click the team domain name to go to CODING.
2. Click <img src ="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d94a8e60dd3a41d0af07d72ae0e9d70e.png" style ="margin:0"> in the upper-right corner to open the project list page and click a project icon to open the corresponding project.
3. In the menu on the left, select **Code Repositories**.
4. If Code Repositories is not shown on the left, the project admin needs to go to **Project Settings** > **Projects and Members** > **Functions** to enable the relevant function.

By default, each code repository is displayed as a card. You can use the [quick actions](#quick-action) on cards to group and sort repositories.

## Group and Sort[](id:group)

On the **Code Repositories** page, you can create repository groups and add multiple repositories to them in batch. Go to **Manage Groups** to adjust the order of repository groups.
