This document describes how to lock files and folders in a code repository.

 

## Open Project

1. Log in to the CODING Console and click the team domain name to go to CODING.
2. Click <img src ="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d94a8e60dd3a41d0af07d72ae0e9d70e.png" style ="margin:0"> in the upper-right corner to open the project list page and click a project icon to open the corresponding project.

CODING allows you to lock files or paths of the **Default Branch (usually the master branch)** in code repositories. Only the user who locked the file can modify (edit or delete) it. If a user locks a path, all files in the path will be locked and can only be modified by the user who locked it.

## Permission Description[](id:permission)

Project admins can enter the project, click **Project Settings** in the lower-left corner, and go to **Projects and Members** > **User Groups** to set permissions for the repository. After setting the permissions, add team members to the relevant user groups to control the permissions to code repositories in the project.

-   A user can only unlock files or paths they locked; a member with permission to **Unlock Locked Files** can unlock files or paths locked by another user.

A locked file can only be edited/deleted by the user who locked the file. Only the user who locked the path can create/edit/delete files in it. If another user tries to modify the locked file by pushing, the push will fail.

In a merge request, if the target branch is the default branch and the directory to be written includes a locked file or path, the merge can only be performed by the user who locked the file or path. Other members cannot merge the branches.
