This document describes how to sign commits with GPG.

 

## Open Project

1. Log in to the CODING Console and click the team domain name to go to CODING.
2. Click <img src ="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d94a8e60dd3a41d0af07d72ae0e9d70e.png" style ="margin:0"> in the upper-right corner to open the project list page and click a project icon to open the corresponding project.

CODING allows you to use GPG for Git commit signature verification. Verified commits will be tagged with **Verified**, which ensures that code is committed from reliable sources and enhances code security.

To sign Git commits with GPG:
<dx-steps>
-Step 1: [Generate a GPG key pair](#generate)
-Step 2: [Add a GPG public key in your personal account settings](#upload)
-Step 3: [Associate with the local Git repository](#associate)
-Step 4: [Sign Git commits](#sign)
-Step 5: [Verify signatures](#verify)
</dx-steps>


## Step 1: Generate a GPG Key Pair[](id:generate)

1.  [Download](https://www.gnupg.org/download/index.html) and install GPG. If you are using macOS, use the brew package management tool to run the following command:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
brew install gpg  
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2.  Run the following command to generate a GPG key pair (public key/private key):
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
gpg --full-gen-key  
:::
</dx-codeblock>
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
In certain scenarios, such as if you are using Windows Gpg4win or other macOS versions, use the `gpg --gen-key` command to generate a key pair.
</dx-alert> 
As the command is interactive, you need to specify the algorithm, validity period, your real name and email address, a password, etc.<ul>
 <li><b>Key type</b>: Select the key type or press <code>Enter</code> to select the default type (RSA and RSA).</li>
 <li><b>Elliptic curve</b>: Press <code>Enter</code> to select the default <code>Curve 25519</code>.</li>
 <li><b>Validity</b>: Specify the validity period of the key as needed or press <code>Enter</code> to select the default `Never expire`.</li>
 <li><b>Email address</b>: Enter the email address configured in your CODING account.</li></ul>
3.  Run the following command to list the GPG key you just created (replace "your_email" with the email address entered in Step 3):
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG "your_email" 
:::
</dx-codeblock>
4.  Copy the GPG key ID that starts with `sec`. In the following example, copy `4AEA00A342C24CA3`:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
sec   ed25519/4AEA00A342C24CA3 2021-09-14 [SC]
      6DE3507E82DEB6E8828FAAC34AEA00A342C24BD4
uid                 [ ultimate ] your_name "your_email"
ssb   cv25519/812B586FD245B560 2021-09-14 [E]
:::
</dx-codeblock>
5.  Export the public key of that ID  (using the above ID as an example):
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
gpg --armor --export 4AEA00A342C24CA3
:::
</dx-codeblock>
6.  After the public key is generated, [add it to your CODING account](#upload).

## Step 2: Add a Public Key in Your Personal Account Settings[](id:upload)

1.  After you have logged in to CODING, click your profile photo in the upper-right corner and select **Personal Account Settings**.
2.  In the navigation bar on the left, select **GPG Public Key** to go to the public key management page.
3.  Click **Add Public Key** and paste the exported GPG public key in the text box, and then click OK.

After the public key is added, the verification status of the email address, key ID, and subkey will be shown.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/5de6ba83223227468315c1b07b40a94c.png)

>?If the status of the email address is Not Verified, the email address is not configured in the CODING account. Add the email address in **Personal Account Settings** > **Email Settings**.

## Step 3: Associate with the Local Git Repository[](id:associate)

1.  Run the following command to list the GPG key you created (replace "your_email" with the email address entered when generating the key):
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG "your_email"
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2.  Copy the GPG key ID that starts with `sec`. In the following example, copy `4AEA00A342C24CA3`:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
sec   ed25519/4AEA00A342C24CA3 2021-09-14 [SC]
      6DE3507E82DEB6E8828FAAC34AEA00A342C24BD4
uid                 [ ultimate ] your_name "your_email"
ssb   cv25519/812B586FD245B560 2021-09-14 [E]
:::
</dx-codeblock>
3.  Configure the key in the local Git repository to sign the commits with it:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
git config --global user.signingkey 4AEA00A342C24CA3
:::
</dx-codeblock>
You have now successfully associated the GPG key with the local Git repository. After modifying code locally, you can sign your Git commits to verify the committer.

## Step 4: Sign Git Commits[](id:sign)

Use the `-S` parameter when running a Git commit command.

1.  When you need to commit changes after editing code locally, add the `-S` parameter to the `git commit` command:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
git commit -S -m "your_commit_message"
:::
</dx-codeblock>
If you do not wish to enter the `-S` flag every time, you can use the following command to allow Git to sign commits automatically:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2.  When asked, enter the password specified when generating the GPG key.

## Step 5: Verify Signature[](id:verify)

After pushing the signed commit to the CODING code repository, you can check the verification status of the commit on the **Commits** tab in the code repository.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/32b6400f1c20a6732ccbfd236a3e3c7a.png)

Commit verification statuses are described below:

|Verification Status|Description|
|:------|:---|
|Verified	|Signed with a GPG private key that corresponds to a public key in a CODING account, and the email address for the public key has been verified.|
|Not Verified	|Signed with a GPG private key that does not correspond to a public key in a CODING account or the email address for the public key has not been verified<br>(if the email address is Not Verified, go to **Personal Account Settings** > **Email Settings** to add the email address). |
|No verification status tag	|Not signed with a GPG private key|

## Delete a GPG Public Key[](id:delete)

If your GPG public key has been compromised or is no longer used, you can delete the public key in **Personal Account Settings** > **GPG Public Key**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/b91fd2a8526828dc2ea2f9d88f1698c3.png)

After the public key is deleted:

-   Verified commits will change to a Not Verified status.
-   Future commits using this GPG private key (`git commit -S -m`) will stay unverified.
-   Unsigned commits (`git commit -m`) will not be verified and will not have a verification status tag.

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/f227308d27e4a0db11d343238706e306.png)

>?If you have enabled Git automatic signing, run the `git config --global commit.gpgsign false` command to disable automatic signing. Otherwise, commits pushed to the remote repository will still be **Not Verified** after the GPG public key is deleted.


## Fix GPG Signing Errors[](id:delete)

If the following error occurs when using `git commit -S -m`, see [Fix GPG Signing Errors](https://www.wevg.org/archives/fix-gpg-sign-error/) and modify the relevant configurations.
