## Delete Source Branch by Default[](id:delete-source-branch)

If this is enabled, the source branch will be deleted after it is merged into the target branch.

## Fast-Forward Merge by Default[](id:fast-forward)

If this is enabled, when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch, the source branch will directly point to the target branch without a merge commit. This process is called the fast-forward merge.

## Merge Mode[](id:merge-method)

Three merge modes are available for a source branch with multiple commits:

-   Direct Merge by Default: Creates a merge commit.
-   Squash Merge by Default: Combines multiple commits of a source branch into one commit, which can be canceled by users.
-   Only Squash Merge: Force combines multiple commits of a source branch into one commit, which cannot be canceled.

## Default Target Branch[](id:default-branch)

The default target branch for merge requests. We recommend you set the master branch as the default target branch for merge requests.
