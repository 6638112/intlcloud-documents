## Adjusting the Time Span and Refreshing Frequency of a Dashboard

- You can adjust the time span and granularity for all charts on the current dashboard by using the time selector in the upper-right corner of the dashboard. In this way, you can review historical monitoring data and perform troubleshooting.
