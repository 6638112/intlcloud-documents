The monitoring overview module is an entry through which you can view the overall monitoring information of Tencent Cloud services. In particular, you can view the information of the following key exceptions.

## CVM is unreachable when pinged

The number of alarm records in the last month whose policy type is "CVM", alarm status is "Uncleared", and alarm type is "Unreachable" are displayed. Uncleared CVM alarms are generally important and may affect the normal operation of your business.

> To troubleshoot the problem of CVM being unreachable when pinged, see [CVM Is Unreachable When Pinged](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/36205).

## CVM disk is read-only

The number of alarm records in the last month whose policy type is "CVM", alarm status is "Uncleared", and alarm type is "Disk Read-Only" are displayed. If your CVM instance has any services for which data needs to be written but your CVM disk is read-only, this problem may affect the normal operation of your business.
