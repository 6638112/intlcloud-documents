## Overview

Currently, the default alarm policy is only supported for CVM (basic monitoring), TencentDB for MongoDB (server monitoring), TencentDB for MySQL (server monitoring), TencentDB for Redis, TDSQL for MySQL, TDSQL for PostgreSQL, CKafka (instance monitoring), ES, DTS, EMR, and CLB.

- When you successfully purchase a Tencent Cloud service that supports the default policy for the first time, Cloud Monitor will automatically create the default alarm policy for you. For more information on the metrics/events supported by the default policy or alarm rules, see the [default policy description](#step1).
- You can also manually create an alarm policy and set it as the default alarm policy. After the default policy is set, newly purchased instances will be automatically associated with the default policy without requiring manual addition.
