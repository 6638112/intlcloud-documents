You can set alarm silence rules for a metric of a Tencent Cloud service’s instance, and you will no longer receive alarm notifications for that metric.

## Use Cases
- If your business system experiences large fluctuations in some metrics or predictable traffic surges as planned, you need to silence the alarms.
- If the system has configured a default alarm policy, but you don’t want to receive alarm notifications for a specific metric of a Tencent Cloud service’s instance configured with that policy, you can silence the alarms.
