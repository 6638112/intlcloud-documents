### Stopping Agents
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title=""> 
The report of CVM metric data will only be stopped unless both Sgagent and BaradAgent are stopped. You can [Stop BaradAgent](#step1) to suspend data report for a while. However, BaradAgent will resume data report in one minute as it will be triggered by Sgagent. Therefore, to stop data report, stop both Sgagent and BaradAgent in sequence by referring to the following directions:
