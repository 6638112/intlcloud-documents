This document describes how to create a notification template in the Cloud Monitor alarm module.

## Use Cases

- One template can be quickly reused for multiple policies, eliminating the need to repeatedly configure user notifications.
- User notification methods can be configured in a more personalized way. For example, you can configure the alarm receiving channel as SMS/email by day and phone by night.
- Different user groups take effect in different notification periods. For example, group A receives alarms by day, while group B by night.
- Different groups can receive different types of alarms. For example, group A receives notifications of alarm triggering, while group B alarm resolving.

## Prerequisites

- View notification templates: the sub-account must have the read permission of Cloud Monitor.
- Create and edit notification templates: the sub-account must have the write permission of Cloud Monitor.

>?For more information on how to grant sub-accounts permissions, please see [Cloud Access Management (CAM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/36744).

## Use Limits

| Feature | Limit |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| User notification | Up to five items can be added |
| API callback | Up to three URLs accessible over the public network can be entered |

## Directions

### Creating notification template

1. Enter the [Alarm Notification Template](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/alarm/notice) page in the Cloud Monitor Console.
2. Click **Create** and enter relevant information in "Create Notification Template".
	- **Template Name**: enter a custom template name.
	- **Notification Type**:
        - Alarm Trigger: a notification will be sent when an alarm is triggered.
        - Alarm Recovery: a notification will be sent when an alarm is resolved.
	- **User Notification**:
        - Recipient Object: you can choose a recipient group or recipient. If you need to create a group, please see [Creating Alarm Recipient Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38908).
        - Notification Period: define the time period for receiving alarms.
        - Receiving Channel: three alarm channels are supported: email, SMS, and phone. You can also set different channels and notification periods in different user dimensions. For more information, please see [Alarm Type, Channel, and Quota](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38908).
		Description of phone alarm settings:
			- Polling Times: the maximum number of dials for each polled recipient when there is no valid reach.
			- Polling Sequence: alarm calls will be dialed according to the order of the recipients. You can adjust the order of calling by dragging up and down recipients.
			- Polling Interval: time interval at which alarm calls will be dialed according to the order of the recipients.
			- Reach Notification: notifications will be to all recipients after successful reception of the call or calling all recipients. SMS messages are counted against the quota.
	- **API Callback**: you can enter up to three URLs accessible over the public network as the callback API addresses, and Cloud Monitor will push alarm messages to them promptly. If the HTTP response returns code 200, the verification is successful. For more information on alarm callback fields, please see [Alarm Callback Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38209#.E5.91.8A.E8.AD.A6.E5.9B.9E.E8.B0.83.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0.E8.AF.B4.E6.98.8E).

> ? 
> - After you save the callback URL, the system will automatically verify your URL once. The timeout threshold for this verification is 5 seconds. When an alarm policy created by the user is triggered or the alarm is resolved, the alarm messages will be pushed through the API callbacks. An alarm message can be pushed up to three times, and the timeout threshold for each request is 5 seconds.
> - When an alarm policy created by the user is triggered or the alarm is resolved, the alarm messages will be pushed through the API callbacks. API callbacks also support repeated alarms.
> - The outbound IP of the Cloud Monitor callback API is dynamically and randomly allocated, so no specific IP information can be provided to you, but the IP port is fixed at 80. We recommend you configure a weighted opening policy in the security group based on port 80.
