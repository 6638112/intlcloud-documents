## Highlights

- The concept of alarm notification template is introduced. It supports personalized subscription to alarms, more flexible alarm reception configurations, and quick application to multiple policies.
   - Alarms can be received in different ways in different time periods. (For example, alarms can be received through SMS by day and through phone by night.)
     - Different user groups take effect in different notification periods. (For example, group A receives alarms by day, while group B by night.)
     - Different users receive alarms in different ways. (For example, group A receives alarms through SMS, while group B through phone.)
     - Alarms can be received by notification type.
     - Multiple API callback addresses can be configured.
- Monitor curves are added to metric alarms, allowing you to accurately set alarms.
- The system automatically detects whether an alarm receiving channel is verified, which helps locate the reason why some users cannot receive alarms.
- The default alarm policy can be deleted.


>?Cloud Monitor will automatically upgrade your service to Alarm 2.0. During the upgrade, the attributes of existing alarm policies stay unchanged, such as policy name, alarm object, trigger condition, and API callback. This upgrade will not affect the triggering and notification sending of your existing alarm policies.

## Features

### Using alarm notification template 

The biggest change in Alarm 2.0 is the introduction of notification template. What is a notification template?

**Notification Template**: Alarm 2.0 introduces the concept of notification template. You can customize the five elements of notification type, recipient object, notification period, notification channel, and API callback to configure a notification template that best suits your business needs. One template can be bound to multiple alarm policies.

Simply put, a notification template can help you answer several questions: what alarm notifications to send? To whom, when, and where to send them? It also improves the efficiency of setting the same notification when creating different alarm policies.

Why introduce notification template? When you configure alarm policies, you generally only change the alarm rules (such as different metrics, thresholds, and events). After the core elements of alarm notification are templated, the workload to repeatedly configure alarm notifications is greatly reduced. Now, when configuring alarm policies, you only need to check options in an existing notification template.

In addition, more customized notification options can be implemented through templated enhancements to further increase the flexibility.

#### Four use cases

 1. Team A wants to receive alarms during working hours, team B late at night, and team C throughout the day.
You can implement this by using a notification template.

2. Alarms need to be received through SMS and email by day but through phone by night.
You don't need to create alarm policies repeatedly; instead, you can implement this by using a notification template.

3. Team A needs to receive alarms through phone, while team b through email.
You don't need to create alarm policies repeatedly; instead, you can implement this by using a notification template.

4. Team A pays attention to alarm triggering, while team B to alarm resolving.
You can copy and paste a notification template and select different notification types.

You can configure an alarm in Cloud Monitor Alarm 2.0 by setting the alarm rule, alarm object, and alarm notification, which together constitute an alarm policy.

**Multiple API callback addresses can be configured**
You can use other API callbacks while configuring work SMS.

### Adding monitor curves to metric alarms

When you set a metric alarm threshold, you can check the trend of the monitor curve to set the alarm more accurately.
