Alarm records are a feature of Cloud Monitor that allows you to look back and view alarms in the past six months. On the alarm records page, you can also quickly subscribe to alarm policies.

4. (Optional) You can also click **Advanced Filter** to search for alarm records by policy name, alarm content, user information, monitor type, and policy type.
