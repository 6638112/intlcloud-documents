| Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value | InstanceType (optional) | Database instance type. Valid values: <br><li>1 (default): Pulls monitoring data from the source <br><li>2: Pulls monitoring data from the replica (single-node and dual-node instance supported only) <br><li>3: Pulls monitoring data from a read-only instance (the ID of the read-only instance must be passed in as `InstanceId`; otherwise, the value `1` will be used for the database instance type by default) <br><li>4: Pulls monitoring data from the second replica (applicable only to Finance Edition) | Enter an instance type (optional). Default value: 1 |

> ? `InstanceType` description:
>
> - If the `InstanceId` value is a source instance ID, only `InstanceType` supports pulling the monitoring data of the source (value: 1), replica (value: 2), read-only instance (value: 3), and second replica (value: 4).
> - If the `InstanceId` value is a source instance ID, the `InstanceType` value is 2 (replica), and the source instance has three nodes (one source and two replicas), then the monitoring data of one monitored node will be missing, as pulling replica monitoring data is supported only for single-node and two-node instances.
> - To pull the monitoring data of a read-only instance, pass in its ID as `InstanceId`.
