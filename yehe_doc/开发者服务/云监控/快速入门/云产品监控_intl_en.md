This document describes the features and operations of Tencent CM.

## Feature Overview
Cloud Monitor is a platform that displays the performance metrics of all Tencent Cloud products. You can view the list of cloud resources and their corresponding monitoring metrics as well as alarm details under your account.

Compared with the service console that only displays the monitoring data, Cloud Monitor also displays the health status and alarm data of instances. You can quickly locate unhealthy instances, analyze cloud resource usage based on the specific data, and troubleshoot problems based on information about exceptions.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitoring Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Cloud Product Monitoring** > **Cloud Virtual Machine** to enter the CVM monitoring list page.
3. Find the CVM instance you want to monitor and click its name to enter the monitoring page.
