### How can I view test progress?
On the Test Plan page, select a test plan to view its test progress and test results, including the pass rate, failure rate, obstruction rate, retest rate, and the number of failed tests and opened bugs.


### How do I select test cases?
CODING-TM uses two types of test cases: **text test cases** and **step test cases**.
- Text test cases: These cases are suitable for simple test scenarios that lack explicit test steps. 
- Step test cases: These cases are suitable for scenarios that have explicit test steps and expected results, where each step must be tested.

### How can I write a text test case?
- Text Case Title (required): Enter a title to easily identify the test case.
- Prerequisites (optional): Use this field to describe the necessary conditions for this test.
- Test Case Content: This is the most important field for a text test case. Describe the specific content to be tested and the expected results.
- In addition to basic fields, you can add **attachments** that you think would be helpful for this test.

### Can I associate with third-party apps?
CODING-TM does not support the association with third-party apps.

### How long does it take to create a report?
It takes some time to generate a report. This time depends on the amount of data involved. After you create a report, its status is "generating". Once the report is completed, its status is changed to "generated".
