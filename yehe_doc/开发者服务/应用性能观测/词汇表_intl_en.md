### App

See [Application]().

### Apdex

Apdex quantifies the application performance in terms of response time based on sampled data for a period of time in the range of 0â€“1, indicating where the application performance falls in the user satisfaction range.

- `0` indicates that no user is satisfied.
- `1` indicates that all users are satisfied.

## M

### Slow call

A call is considered slow if its response time exceeds two seconds.

### Slow SQL
A SQL statement is considered slow when its execution time exceeds two seconds.


## S
### Instance

An instance is a Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instance containing basic computing components such as CPU, memory, operating system, network, and disk.
CVM instances provide secure, reliable, and elastic computing services in the cloud to meet computing requirements. As business demands change, computing resources can be added or removed in real time to reduce software and hardware costs and simplify IT Ops.

## T

### Throughput (QPS)

Throughput refers to the number of calls per second in database components (including database connections and execution methods, such as `execute`) or that in NoSQL components (including various contained methods).


## X

### Response time

The response time is the time it takes an application to process a request after receiving it.

## Y

### Business system

A business system is a set of applications for a certain business such as ecommerce, OA, and email. A business system can contain one or more applications, while an application can belong to only one business system.

### Exception

An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during code execution but has no effect on the user access. It can be external service exception, database exception, NoSQL exception, MQ exception, code exception, and log component record exception.

### Application

- In Tencent Cloud Weiling smart building operating system and smart building operations system, an application is a system or service program.
- In TcaplusDB, an application refers to a game application that is considered a unit. AppID is displayed on the configuration information page and is used as a connection parameter for the TcaplusDB SDK connection table.
- In TKE, an application consists of one or more services, which can be quickly deployed with templates.
- In APM, an application is a program that provides a feature or service. Usually, it is a web application running on the web application server or cluster, a Java application running in standalone mode, or a PHP application running on the Apache HTTP server. An application contains one or more instances, on each of which the same application runs.

## Z

### Execution time

For external services, NoSQL operations, and database operations, the execution time is the time from request initiation to response receipt.
