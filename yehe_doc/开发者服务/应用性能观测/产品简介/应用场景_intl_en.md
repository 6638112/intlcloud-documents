## Locating Performance Bottlenecks

#### Challenges
As the business grows, the business logic and service call become increasingly complicated, making it harder to analyze and locate application performance problems and bringing huge challenges to monitoring and Ops:
- Dependencies between applications are complicated and hard to sort out.
- Call traces are too long to easily locate and troubleshoot problems.
- API and database call relationships are complex and difficult to manage.

#### Solutions
- APM locates performance bottlenecks through automatic application topology discovery.
- It optimizes the application performance based on key performance metric comparison.
- It allows you to configure alarms for metric changes and detect exceptions promptly.

## Optimizing Application Performance and User Experience

#### Challenges
When the business volume increases suddenly, various issues may occur, such as slow cross-application calls and API loading, resulting in a poor user experience. The complexity of cross-application calls makes it hard to analyze application performance issues.

#### Solutions
APM offers the dependency topology feature. You can analyze the number and duration of calls of each application to identify services with high load and low load and then reasonably allocate resources.
- APM aggregates and summarizes all call information to analyze the calls and responses of each application.
- It enables you to quickly discover critical service paths and API paths in the entire system call topology.
- It helps you identify unreasonable calls such as frequent database operations and dependency loops.
