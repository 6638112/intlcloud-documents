Application Performance Management (APM) offers performance analysis and automatic troubleshooting capabilities for distributed application architectures. With APM, you can collect data and monitor your different applications in real time, helping you guarantee the stability and availability of your complex business system. In this way, you can quickly locate performance problems, shorten the mean time to repair (MTTR), stay up to date with the application performance, and improve the user experience.
APM is developed based on the open-source OpenTracing protocol and supports a wide variety of frameworks and programming languages for you to easily monitor the application performance at one stop.

## Benefits

### Out-of-the-box service
Monitor your application out of the box with non-intrusive probes, with no business/code logic modifications and configurations needed.

### High compatibility
- Enjoy good compatibility with the OpenTracing protocol and many open-source components to leverage the experience of global developers.
- Cover popular programming languages such as Java, Go, Python, C++, and PHP, with more to come.

### Multidimensional drill-down analysis
- Continuously observe the calls of each service, API, and service instance and discover the call data of the middleware in the corresponding systems.
- Easily stay informed of the system running status in various dimensions and drill down based on key monitoring metrics like throughput, response time, and error rate. 

### Open-source compatibility
Migrate your monitoring service from SkyWalking and Jaeger to APM by simply modifying data reporting configurations. APM supports protocols in diverse programming languages and is compatible with OpenTracing, a widely used standard in the industry. This eliminates the need for complicated Ops and reduces development costs.

### High stability and reliability
Enjoy stable and reliable tracing capabilities based on Tencent Cloud's big data capabilities and many years of experience in microservice monitoring and tracing.
