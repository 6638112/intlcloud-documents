This document describes how to create a business system to manage your applications by category. You can set different retention periods and report quotas for different business systems.

## Directions
1. Go to the [**Resource management**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apm/monitor/team) page in the APM console.
2. Click **Create** to pop up the **Create business system** window.
3. Configure the system information as follows.

| Configuration Item  | Description      |
|---------|---------|
| Business system name | Enter a custom business system name.                                           |
| Billing mode     | Currently, only pay-as-you-go is supported.                                           |
