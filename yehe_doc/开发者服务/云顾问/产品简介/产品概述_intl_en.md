As Tencent Cloud services are being iterated, more of them will be supported, and more risk assessment items will be available.


#### Flexible assessment configuration

- Advisor allows you to customize assessment items. You can block the items that you don't care about to simplify the assessment reports and focus on the core metrics.
- Advisor allows you to specify ignorable cloud resources to reduce the impact of testing resources on the assessment results, so that you can focus on the running status of core resources.

#### Systemic optimization suggestions

Advisor provides targeted and practical optimization suggestions online for each assessment item based on the best practices accumulated over Tencent Cloud's many years of customer service. Then, you can optimize services and resources accordingly.
You can also authorize our technical experts to access your inspection reports online and provide suggestions that are more systemic and professional, so as to help you prevent risks and improve business continuity.
