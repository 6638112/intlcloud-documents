## What is Config?

Config helps you audit and govern cloud resources in a centralized manner. It continuously records and evaluates the configuration information and change operations of different types of cloud resources in different regions under your account. This helps you efficiently monitor resources and regulate Ops.

## How it works

After resource monitoring is enabled, Config will automatically discover Tencent Cloud resources, record the configuration information, and generate a configuration snapshot after the configuration changes. If you also enable the official managed rules, Config will continuously evaluate the resource configuration based on the rules to help you promptly discover non-compliant resources during Ops.
