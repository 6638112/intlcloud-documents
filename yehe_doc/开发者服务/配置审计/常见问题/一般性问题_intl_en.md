## What is Config?

Config helps you audit and govern cloud resources in a centralized manner. It continuously records and evaluates the configuration information and change operations of different types of cloud resources in different regions under your account. This helps you efficiently monitor resources and regulate Ops.

## What can Config do?

Config can do the following:

- **Streamlined operational management**

If your resources are deployed in multiple regions, their management and Ops are decentralized, leading to troublesome Ops and inconsistent configurations. Config aggregates and displays resources by type and region and supports search. In this way, you can easily stay up to date with the overall status of the current cloud environment.

- **Continuous compliance management**

Different enterprises have different potential compliance issues for cloud IT management. To address them, Config offers compliance rules and packs based on Tencent Cloud's best practices to automatically execute continuous compliance evaluations for cloud resource configurations under your account. This helps you promptly govern cloud resources and efficiently monitor them.

- **External and internal audits**

When you manage and manipulate IT resources in the cloud, you may frequently modify resources and resource configurations. To respond to external or internal compliance regulations, you usually need to provide resource Ops records timely. However, manually querying such records can be very inefficient. To tackle this problem, Config can record the configuration changes and automatically generate resource configuration timelines to help meet the following needs:
1. Resource configuration lifecycle record
Config records the configurations and changes of each resource from creation, so that you can quickly locate the resource configuration history and relevant change operations on the timeline. This makes it easier for you to perform problem review and audit analysis.
2. Configuration record delivery service
You can deliver the resource configuration history and configuration lifecycle records to a COS bucket for storage. Then, you can quickly provide historical data requested by regulators.

## Who should use Config?

Config's target customers are those in need of audit and governance for their cloud resources in diverse industries, such as finance, gaming, retail, government affairs, and healthcare. Target users are usually team members responsible for cloud resource management, such as cloud Ops, audit, and security personnel.
