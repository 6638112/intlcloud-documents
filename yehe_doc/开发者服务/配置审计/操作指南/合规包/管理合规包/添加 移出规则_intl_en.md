There are two methods to add an existing rule to a conformance pack: 1) Go to the **Conformance pack list** page, click **Edit**, and go to the next step to **Add rule**; 2) Go to the **Conformance pack details** page and click **Add rule**. Similarly, you can remove an existing rule from a conformance pack.

If you select a rule that has been added to a conformance pack from the managed rule list, conformance pack template list, or rule list, the system will automatically copy and create a rule and add it to the current conformance pack.
