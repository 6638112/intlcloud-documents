For a rule that is no longer needed, go to the **Rule list** page and click **Delete**, or click the rule name to go to the rule details page and click **Delete**. Rules need to be **disabled** before deletion, in order to prevent accidental deletion. Rules that have been added to a conformance pack can be deleted in batches by deleting the conformance pack.
