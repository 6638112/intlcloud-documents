Agent management is used to implement customized reporting of monitoring data to TMP when monitoring objects are deployed in CVM or self-built IDC. After data is successfully reported, you can view the monitoring dashboards through the integrated open-source visualization tool Grafana. You can also set alarm rules for the monitoring objects to monitor their status in real time and trigger alarm notifications as soon as the status becomes exceptional.
