Prometheus provides an [official Go library](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang) to collect and expose the monitoring data. This document describes how to use it to expose the Go runtime data and use TMP to collect metrics and display data with some basic samples.

>?For Go client API documentation, please see [Prometheus Go client library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang).



## Installation

You can run the following `go get` commands to install the relevant dependencies:

```bash
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promauto
go get github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp
```

## Start (Runtime Metrics)

1. Prepare an HTTP service with the commonly used path `/metrics`. You can directly use the [`Handler`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.8.0/prometheus/promhttp#Handler) function provided in [`prometheus/promhttp`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.8.0/prometheus/promhttp).
The following is a sample Go application, which exposes some default metrics (including runtime, process, and build metrics) through `http://localhost:2112/metrics`:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  go
package main

import (
        "net/http"

        "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
)

func main() {
        http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
        http.ListenAndServe(":2112", nil)
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2. Run the following command to start the application:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  bash
go run main.go
:::
</dx-codeblock>
3. Run the following command to access the basic built-in metric data:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  bash
curl http://localhost:2112/metrics
:::
</dx-codeblock>

## Application Layer Metrics

1. The above sample only exposes some basic built-in metrics. For metrics at the application layer, you need to add them additionally (we will provide some SDKs in the future for easier integration). The following sample exposes a [Counter](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#counter) metric named `myapp_processed_ops_total` to count the currently completed operations. The operation is performed once every 2 seconds, and the count increases by 1 each time:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  go
package main

import (
        "net/http"
        "time"

        "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
        "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promauto"
        "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
)

func recordMetrics() {
        go func() {
                for {
                        opsProcessed.Inc()
                        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
                }
        }()
}

var (
        opsProcessed = promauto.NewCounter(prometheus.CounterOpts{
                Name: "myapp_processed_ops_total",
                Help: "The total number of processed events",
        })
)

func main() {
        recordMetrics()

        http.Handle("/metrics", promhttp.Handler())
        http.ListenAndServe(":2112", nil)
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2. Run the following command to start the application:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  bash
go run main.go
:::
</dx-codeblock>
3. Run the following command to access the exposed metrics:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  bash
curl http://localhost:2112/metrics
:::
</dx-codeblock>
From the output result, you can see the information related to the <code>myapp_processed_ops_total</code> counter, including the help documentation, type information, metric name, and current value, as shown below:
```
# HELP myapp_processed_ops_total The total number of processed events
# TYPE myapp_processed_ops_total counter
myapp_processed_ops_total 666
```

## Using TMP

Two samples are used above to show how to use the Prometheus Go library to expose application metric data. However, because the exposed data is in text format, youâ€™ll need to set up and maintain an additional Prometheus service to collect metrics, which may require additional Grafana dashboards for visual display.

In contrast, if you use TMP, you can directly skip the above steps and achieve the same purpose with just a few clicks. For more information, please see Getting Started.

### Packaging and deploying application

1. A Go application generally can use a Dockerfile in the following format (it should be modified as needed):
   <dx-codeblock>
   :::  dockerfile
   FROM golang:alpine AS builder
   RUN apk add --no-cache ca-certificates \
        make \
        git
   COPY . /go-build
   RUN cd /go-build && \
        export GO111MODULE=on && \
        export GOPROXY=https://goproxy.io && \
        go build -o 'golang-exe' path/to/main/

FROM alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache tzdata
COPY --from=builder /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs
COPY --from=builder /go-build/golang-exe /usr/bin/golang-exe
ENV TZ Asia/Shanghai
CMD ["golang-exe"]
:::
</dx-codeblock>
2. You can use an image from [Tencent Cloud Image Registry](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/9117) or another public or self-built image registry.
3. You need to define a Kubernetes resource based on your application type. Here, a [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is used as shown below:
   <dx-codeblock>
   ::: yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
    name: golang-app-demo
    labels:
    app: golang-app-demo
   spec:
    replicas: 3
    selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: golang-app-demo
    template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: golang-app-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: golang-exe-demo:v1
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
       :::
       </dx-codeblock>
4. You also need a Kubernetes [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) for scrape configuration and load balancing.
   <dx-codeblock>
   ::: yaml 
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Service
   metadata:
    name: golang-app-demo
   spec:
    selector:
    app: golang-app-demo
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      :::
      </dx-codeblock>
      <dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
      You must add a label to identify the current application. The label name doesn't necessarily need to be `app`, but there must be a label with the similar meaning. You can add other extended labels by relabeling when adding a data collection task subsequently.
      </dx-alert>
5. You can use the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/) or directly use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) to submit the resource definitions to Kubernetes and wait for successful creation.

### Adding data collection task

After the service runs, you need to configure TMP to discover and collect the monitoring metrics in the following steps:

1. Log in to the [TMP console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/prometheus) and select the target TMP instance to enter the management page.
2. Click a **cluster ID** in the TKE cluster list to enter the **Integrate with TKE** page.
3. In **Scrape Configuration**, add a ServiceMonitor. Currently, TMP supports discovering the corresponding target instance address through labels; therefore, you can add some specific K8s labels to some services, which will be automatically identified by TMP after configuration, eliminating your need to add scrape tasks for all services one by one. The configuration information for the above sample is as follows:

> ?The `port` value is the `spec/ports/name` value in the Service YAML configuration file.

<dx-codeblock>
::: yaml
  apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
  kind: ServiceMonitor
  metadata:
    name: go-demo    # Enter a unique name
    namespace: cm-prometheus  # The namespace is fixed. Do not change it
  spec:
    endpoints:
    - interval: 30s
      # Enter the name of the corresponding port of the Prometheus exporter in the Service YAML configuration file
      port: 2112
      # Enter the value of the corresponding path of the Prometheus exporter. If it is not specified, it will be `/metrics` by default
      path: /metrics
      relabelings:
      # ** There must be a label named `application`. Here, suppose that K8s has a label named `app`
      # Use the `replace` action of `relabel` to replace it with `application`
      - action: replace
        sourceLabels:  [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app]
        targetLabel: application
    # Select the namespace where the Service to be monitored resides
    namespaceSelector:
      matchNames:
      - golang-demo
      # Enter the label value of the Service to be monitored to locate the target Service
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: golang-app-demo
:::
</dx-codeblock>

>!You must configure the label named `application` in the sample; otherwise, you cannot use some other out-of-the-box integration features of TMP. For more advanced usage, please see [ServiceMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#servicemonitor) or [PodMonitor](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/master/Documentation/api.md#podmonitor).

### Viewing monitoring information

1. In the [TMP instance](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/prometheus) list, find the corresponding TMP instance, click <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/978c842f0c093a31df8d5240dd01016d.png" width="2%"/> on the right of the instance ID to open your Grafana page, and enter your account and password to access the Grafana visual dashboard operation section.
2. Enter Grafana, click the <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7e3fff6131aa085987552a9725e9ae54.png" width="2%"/> icon to expand the monitoring dashboard, and click the name of the corresponding monitoring chart to view the monitoring data.

## Summary

This document uses two samples to describe how to expose Go metrics to TMP and how to use the built-in visual charts to view monitoring data. This document only uses the Counter metrics. In other scenarios, you many need to use Gauge, Histogram, and Summary metrics. For more information, please see [Metric Types](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/).

For other use cases, TMP will integrate more frameworks to provide more out-of-the-box monitoring metrics, visual dashboards, and alerting templates.
