## Overview

 TMP currently provides integration methods for common basic components and corresponding out-of-the-box monitoring dashboards. As TMP is compatible with the native Prometheus, you can also install other exporters available in the community.

## Directions

If there is no integration method available for the basic component you want to use, you can integrate it as follows and customize a monitoring dashboard to meet your monitoring requirements:

1. Find your component in [EXPORTERS AND INTEGRATIONS](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/) and integrate it as instructed.
2. Refer to the integration method for MySQL.
