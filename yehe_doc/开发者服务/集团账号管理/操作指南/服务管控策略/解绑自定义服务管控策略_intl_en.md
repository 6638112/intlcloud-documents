You can unbind a custom service control policy at any time. Then, the originally bound departments or members will not be controlled by the policy. Make sure that the result of the unbinding operation is as expected to avoid affecting the normal business operations.

## Background

Both system policies and custom service control policies can be unbound, but the last policy bound to a department or member cannot be unbound.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TCO console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/organization).

2. On the left sidebar, select **Organization account** > **Service control policy**.

3. Click the name of the target policy to enter the policy details page and select **Binding management**.

4. In the list, click the target department or member and click **Unbind**.

5. Click **OK**.
