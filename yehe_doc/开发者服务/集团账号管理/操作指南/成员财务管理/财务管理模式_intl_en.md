TCO integrates the finance management methods of organization users to provide the **unified organization payment mode**.

### Unified organization payment mode

In unified organization payment mode, member accounts top up the admin account, and the consumption of each member account is automatically paid by the admin account uniformly, with no need of fund allocation. For users of the same entity, the admin can be set as the payer account to automatically pay for their used resources.
