Tencent Cloud Organization (TCO) is a unified service for managing all of your Tencent Cloud accounts. It allows you to create an organization and then add the Tencent Cloud accounts of your headquarters and subsidiaries by inviting them to join your organization or creating them directly. You can configure different permission policies such as finance, resource, and log management for different accounts as needed. All of these features help you improve your budget control, security, and compliance.

This document describes the key concepts in TCO and how to use TCO.
