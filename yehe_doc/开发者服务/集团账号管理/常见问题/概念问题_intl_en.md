### What is an organization?
An organization refers to a series of Tencent Cloud accounts that you can organize into a hierarchy for central management.

### What is a Tencent Cloud account?
A Tencent Cloud account is a container for your Tencent Cloud resources. You can create and manage resources under your account, with many management features available, such as access control and billing.

### What is a root account?
A root account refers to a Tencent Cloud account that is used to create an organization. With the root account, you can create accounts in your organization, invite other accounts, manage invitations, and remove accounts. You can also associate policies with entities such as the admin root, organizational units, and accounts in the organization.

### What is a member account?
A member account is a non-root Tencent Cloud account in an organization. If you are the organization admin, you can create member accounts in your organization and invite existing accounts. You can also apply policies to member accounts. A member account can be in only one organization.

### What is the admin root?
The admin root is the starting point for organizing Tencent Cloud accounts. It is the highest-level container in an organizational structure. Under the root, you can create organizational units to logically group accounts and arrange these units in the hierarchy as needed by your business.

### What is an organizational unit?
An organizational unit (also referred to as a department) is a group of Tencent Cloud accounts in an organization. Additional organizational units can also be nested under an organizational unit as long as they are within the allowed hierarchical limits. For example, you can place all accounts belonging to the same department into a department unit. Similarly, you can also group all accounts running production services into a production unit. When you need to apply the same controls to a group of accounts in the organization, the organizational unit feature is very useful. You can create even smaller management units by nesting units. For example, you can categorize team accounts within a department into different team-level units. You can directly specify controls for these team-level units, and they will also inherit policies from their parent units.
