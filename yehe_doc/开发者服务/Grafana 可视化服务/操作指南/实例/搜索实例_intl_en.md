3. You can filter instances by different conditions. Currently, the following dimensions are supported:
   - Instance ID: you can directly enter multiple instance IDs for quick filtering. Each instance ID supports only full match-based filtering.
   - Instance name: you can enter only one instance name for filtering. Fuzzy match-based filtering is supported.
   - Status: you can enter multiple status values for filtering. You can also configure the list header for quick filtering.
   - Tag: you can enter multiple tags to filter instances. You can also directly click a tag value in the instance list for filtering.
