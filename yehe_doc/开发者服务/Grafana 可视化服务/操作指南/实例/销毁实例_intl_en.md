If you no longer use an instance, you can terminate/return it, and it will be suspended once terminated/returned. You can reboot suspended instances according to different scenarios and needs.

## Impact

Once an instance is suspended, its data will be affected as follows:

- IP: the corresponding IP address will be returned.
- Grafana: Grafana cannot be accessed at the corresponding domain name.
- Data retention: after an instance is terminated/returned, it will be suspended and retained for 7 days, after which it will be terminated and its data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.


## Directions

1. Log in to the [TCMG console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/grafana/list).
2. In the instance list, select the Grafana instance to be terminated/returned and click **More** > **Instance Status** > **Terminate/Return** on the right.
3. As termination/return is a high-risk operation, in the **Terminate/Return** window that pops up, complete the three termination/return steps as prompted and click **OK**.
