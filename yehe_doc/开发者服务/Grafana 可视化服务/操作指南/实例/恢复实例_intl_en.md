You can recover a terminated instance as needed.

## Impact

Once an instance is recovered, its data will be affected as follows:

- IP: the instance will occupy the IPs of two subnets exclusively.
- Grafana: you can continue to access Grafana at the corresponding domain name.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [TCMG console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/grafana/list).
2. In the instance list, select the Grafana instance to be recovered and click **More** > **Instance Status** > **Recover** on the right.
