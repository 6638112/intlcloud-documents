To make it easier for you to use the TCMG service, if you are not satisfied after purchasing a monthly subscribed TCMG instance, you can return it as follows:
- You can return **one** TCMG instance unconditionally within five days after purchase, and the valid amount you paid will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account.
- In addition, you can also enjoy normal returns. Fees for consumed resources will be deducted from the refund. The remaining amount, including cash and trial credit, will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account.

All of the above operations can be perform in the [TCMG console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/grafana). For more information, see [Self-Service Return Operation](#step1).

## Notes
- After a monthly subscribed instance is returned, once its status changes to **Terminating** or **Terminated**, it will no longer incur fees.
- After a monthly subscribed instance is returned, it will become suspended. You can renew it as needed.
- After a monthly subscribed instance is terminated, it will become inaccessible, and its resources will be released.
- Resources purchased during promotions might not be eligible for return.

## 5-Day Unconditional Refund
- Under one single account, you can return **one** TCMG instance unconditionally within five (included) days after purchase.
- **Tencent Cloud has the right to reject any suspected abnormal or malicious application for return.**
- For an order that meets the five-day unconditional return policy, the refunded amount is all the amount paid for purchase, including the cash amount, earnings amount, and trial credit amount.

## Normal Return
If you have already returned an instance unconditionally within five days after purchase, you can also return monthly subscribed instances in a self-service manner at any time in the console.
Fees for consumed resources will be deducted from the refund. The remaining amount, including cash and trial credit, will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account.

#### Normal return rules
**Refund = currently effective order amount + ineffective order amount - used resource value**
- Currently effective order amount refers to the amount paid for the currently effective order, excluding discounts and vouchers.
- Ineffective order amount refers to the amount paid for the order that will take effect in the future, excluding vouchers.
- The used resource value is calculated as follows:
 - For the used resources, if the usage has lasted at least one month as of the date of return, fees will be deducted by month; otherwise, fees will be deducted by usage.
 - The usage is accurate down to the second.
 - If the refund is â‰¤ 0, it will be calculated as 0, and resources will be deleted.
