TEM is currently in closed beta test. To try it out, please submit an application. After your application is approved, you can use this service free of charge between March 16 and June 30, 2021. You need to pay for other Tencent Cloud services you select such as [CFS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/9553) though.

After the closed beta test ends, this service will undergo public beta test. We will announce this in the release center. If prices change, we will notify you in advance.
