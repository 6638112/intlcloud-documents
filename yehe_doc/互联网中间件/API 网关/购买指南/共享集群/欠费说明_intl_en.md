## Overdue Payment and Service Suspension

- You can continue to use the API Gateway service within 24 hours (inclusive) after your account has overdue payment.
- If you fail to pay the past due charges within 24 hours, your APIs will be suspended, and we will notify your Tencent Cloud account creator and all the collaborators through email and SMS.
- Within 180 days after the service is suspended, if you pay the past due charges, the service will be automatically resumed; otherwise, API Gateway will have the right to clear your API configuration information and destroy your data.
