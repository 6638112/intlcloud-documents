## Billing Example
Billing for the Guangzhou region is as shown in the following example:
The backend business is in a different region from API Gateway and receives five million API calls accumulatively in a month, each of which returns a response of about 3 KB in size, and the size of each request of data forwarded from API Gateway to the backend business is 1 KB.
- API Gateway call fees = 5 million * 0.0089 USD/10,000 calls = 4.45 USD
- Total data transfer volume = 5 million * 3 KB = 15 million KB = 14.3 GB
- Total additional data transfer volume = 5 million * 1 KB = 5 million KB = 4.77 GB
- Total data transfer fees = 14.3 GB * 0.12 USD/GB + 4.77 GB * 0.12 USD/GB = 2.29 USD
- Total fees = 4.45 USD + 2.29 USD = 6.74 USD
