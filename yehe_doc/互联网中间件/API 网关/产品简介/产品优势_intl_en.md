## Simplified Management

You can perform all API management operations in the same place throughout the API lifecycle, including API creation, maintenance, and release. Through API Gateway, you can encapsulate and manage serverless functions from SCF, web services on CVM instances, and your own web services in a unified manner.

## Pay-as-You-Go Billing

You only need to pay for the API calls and the outbound network traffic generated in API Gateway. API management, documentation maintenance, SDK generation, traffic control, and permission control are all free of charge.

## High Performance and Reliability

By fully utilizing the powerful capabilities of TGW (Tencent Gateway), API Gateway provides high-performance and high-reliability services through multi-regional multi-server distributed clusters to sustain high numbers of large-traffic API calls

 ## Security and Controllability

API Gateway ensures security of API calls in various authentication methods, prevents overload of your business through strict traffic control, and ensures high business availability with the aid of comprehensive monitoring and alarming mechanisms.
