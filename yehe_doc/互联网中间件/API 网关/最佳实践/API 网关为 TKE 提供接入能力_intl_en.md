## Introduction to TKE

Based on native Kubernetes, Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) is a container-oriented, highly scalable, and high-performance container management service. Compared with a client's container service, TKE has core advantages such as its ease of use, flexible expansion, security, reliability, high efficiency, and low costs. For more information, see [Tencent Kubernetes Engine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457).

## Overview

As an open source platform for automated container operations, Kubernetes is a mainstream choice for developers. However, the access capability of Kubernetes clusters are not sufficient and cannot meet the requirements of large applications. Using API Gateway as the access layer of Kubernetes can significantly improve the access capability of Kubernetes clusters and empower Kubernetes clusters with advanced capabilities of API Gateway, adapting to more scenarios of more customers.

## Prerequisites

You have activated Tencent Cloud services such as API Gateway, TKE, Cloud Load Balancer (CLB), Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) and have permission to configure these services, as they will be used during the configuration process.

### Step 4: Create a nginx service in the TKE cluster
1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2). In the left sidebar, click **Cluster** to access the TKE cluster list page.
2. Click the ID of the TKE cluster created in [Step 3](#3) to access the cluster details page.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Workload** -> **Deployment** to access the deployment list page.
4. Click **Create** at the top of the deployment list page to access the workload creation page.
5. Set the parameters on the workload creation page by following the instructions in [Creating a Simple Nginx Service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/7851).
 >!
 >- Select a DockerHub nginx image.
 >- Set **Service Access** to **Via VPC**.
 >- Set **Load Balancer** to **Automatic creation**.
 >- In the **Port Mapping** area, set **Protocol** to **TCP**, and set both **Target Port** and **Port** to 80.
6. Click **Create Workload** to finish creating the Workload. TKE will automatically create the corresponding deployment and service.

### Step 5: Create an API Gateway service
1. Log in to the [API Gateway console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apigateway).
2. In the left sidebar, click **Service** to access the service list page.
3. Click **Create** at the top of the service list. In the pop-up dialog box, create an API Gateway service by following the instructions in [Creating Services](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11787).

### Step 6: Create an API in the API Gateway service
1. In the [API Gateway console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apigateway), click **Service** in the left sidebar to access the service list page.
