You can select "No authentication" for your API when creating it.
- If "No authentication" is checked, authentication will succeed and the bound usage plan will take effect when API Gateway receives an anonymous request.
- If signature authentication is performed with the key in the usage plan, the traffic limit in the usage plan will take effect.
- In case of access by an anonymous user, the maximum traffic limit imposed on each API by Tencent Cloud will take effect.
