## Operation Scenarios
After a service is published, you can access APIs in it through its subdomain names or the bound custom domain name.

## Directions
A service provides two forms of subdomain names: `http://{your-unique-id}.{region}.apigateway.myqcloud.com` and `http://{service-id}-{your-unique-id}.{region}.apigw.tencentcs.com`. The following uses the former as an example:

After the release, depending on the release environment, the access path of a specific API is like `http://{your-unique-id}.{region}.apigateway.myqcloud.com/release`.

For example, if your user ID is `2768864771`, and you have created a service named `register` in the Guangzhou region (`gz`) with a service ID of `service-n904iiau`, added an API with the path of `/user` to it, and published it in the release environment, then when another user or application needs to access the `/user` API, the correct access path should be `http://service-n904iiau-2768864771.ap-guangzhou.apigateway.myqcloud.com/release/user`.
