## Operation Scenarios

This document describes how to authenticate and manage your APIs through key pair authentication in JavaScript.

## Directions
1. In the [API Gateway Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/apigateway/index?rid=1), create an API and select the authentication type as "key pair authentication" (for more information, please see [API Creation Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11795)).
2. Publish the service where the API resides to the release environment (for more information, please see [Service Release and Deactivation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11809)).
3. Create a key pair on the key management page in the console.
4. Create a usage plan on the usage plan page in the console and bind it to the created key pair (for more information, please see [Sample Usage Plan](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11816)).
5. Bind the usage plan to the API or the service where the API resides.
6. Generate signing information in JavaScript by referring to the [Sample Code](#example).

## Notes
- The eventually delivered HTTP request contains at least two headers: `Date` or `X-Date` and `Authorization`. More optional headers can be added in the request. If `Date` is used, the server will not check the time; if `X-Date` is used, the server will check the time.
- The value of `Date` header is the construction time of the HTTP request in GMT format, such as Fri, 09 Oct 2015 00:00:00 GMT.
- The value of `X-Date` header is the construction time of the HTTP request in GMT format, such as Mon, 19 Mar 2018 12:08:40 GMT. It cannot deviate from the current time for more than 15 minutes.
- If it is a microservice API, you need to add two fields in the header: `X-NameSpace-Code` and `X-MicroService-Name`. They are not needed for general APIs and are included in the demo by default.
