### Does CKafka support public network access?
Currently, CKafka transfers data over the private network by default. As public network access runs the risk of issues such as delay and network environment security, we do not recommend long-term use of public network transfer.
If you have temporary need for public network transfer, please contact your Tencent Cloud account manager by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for evaluation and assistance.
