>- The offset value should be between the minimum offset and the maximum offset. If it is configured to be smaller than the minimum offset, the consumption will start from the minimum offset; if it is larger than the maximum offset, the consumption will start from the maximum offset.
>- Make sure that there are no consumers in a consumer group before resetting the group.
