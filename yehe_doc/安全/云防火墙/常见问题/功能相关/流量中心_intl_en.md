### How frequently is the Traffic Monitoring updated? How frequently are traffic logs updated?

### Why does the CFW peak traffic value not match the actual value?
- The traffic diagram displays the average bandwidth value, which means the average value within the statistical period.
- The peak value is calculated based on the traffic statistics collected every 10 seconds. The average traffic of an IP address is reported every 10 seconds, and the largest value among a specific period of time is regarded as the peak value.
- Alert and billing are both based on the traffic statistics displayed on the page.
