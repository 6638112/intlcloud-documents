### Easy to enable and deploy
Based on SDN, Cloud Firewall offers a public cloud SaaS firewall with simple policy configuration and no hardware deployment costs. It can automatically identify cloud assets and allows you to enable or disable your firewalls with one click.
### Stable, reliable, and scale at ease
With a primary-secondary disaster recovery system and SaaS features, Cloud Firewall boasts high stability and reliability, and supports easy bandwidth, asset, and storage scaling.
### Centralized management for high efficiency
- Cloud Firewall offers users a centralized access control plane for access control and security isolation on traffic between networks and VPCs.
	- Network perimeter access control: Block or observe malicious traffic and prevent attacks from malicious sources on cloud assets based on the access control rules configured for public IP addresses.
	- Inter-VPC access control: Control access between VPCs with inter-VPC rules for inter-VPC security isolation.
	- Enterprise security group: Facilitate management of security group configuration with the 5-tuple configuration model and build a cloud demilitarized zone (DMZ) easily with blocked request logs and protection between subnets in a VPC, VPCs, and direct connections of hybrid clouds.
- By following the rule configuration model of traditional firewalls, Cloud Firewall is easy to learn and use for security O&M specialists in the actual scenarios.

### Log storage and audit
- Rule hit log: When an access control rule is matched and applied, Cloud Firewall will record the 5-tuple information of the matched traffic and rule to help you with security operations and maintenance. If any failure occurs, you can use the logs to fix it quickly.
- User operation log: Records user operations on Cloud Firewall, including account login operations, Cloud Firewall toggle operations, and the add, delete, and edit operations on rules to help with management efficiency and costs.
