### Outbound access control
For outbound connections, if you need to block access to a specified external address or domain name from CVMs, you can configure outbound access control rules for the public IP address to meet your security requirements.

### Inbound access control
For inbound connections, if you need to block access to CVMs from a specified external address, you can configure inbound access control rules for the public IP address to meet your security requirements.

### Hit log audit
If you need to audit the hits of CFW's access control rules, or trace the applied rules in case of failure, CFW's rule hit log audit feature can help you with rapid log audit and troubleshooting, improving your efficiency in security operations and maintenance at a lower cost.

### Operation log audit
To manage CFW operations, you can use CFW's user operation logs to obtain the time, content, and account information of any CFW operation.
