**Alarm management** presents the data of cyber attacks and risk events detected by the **Intrusion defense** and **Security baseline** modules. The data is divided into **Attack alerts**, **Blocked attacks**, and **Honeypot events** based on the action taken by CFW.
- Attack alerts: all detected cyber attacks and risk events, which need to be blocked or ignored manually by users.
- Blocked attacks: all detected cyber attacks and risk events that are automatically blocked by the system. The data is used for subsequent audits and troubleshooting.
- Honeypot events: all detected cyber attacks and risk events against probes and honeypots. You can set the system to block or allow such attacks and events.
