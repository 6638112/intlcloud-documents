You can create trusted users through Security Token Service (STS) and give them temporary security keys to manage your Tencent Cloud resources within the limited permission. Compared to a long-term access key, it has the following advantages:
- No need to embed a long-term security certificate.
- You can grant trusted users permission to your Tencent Cloud resources, instead of creating an account for them.
- Temporary security key is valid for a limited period of time. You donâ€™t have to rotate or cancel keys regularly. Besides, it can also reduce the impacts of identity credential leakage.
