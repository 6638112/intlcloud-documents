- SSM fees consist of secret storage fees and API call fees.
- SSM is a **monthly pay-as-you-go** service. You are only billed based on your actual usage. Fees for the month are calculated, billed, and charged on the 3rd to 5th days of the following month.
>!SSM uses [KMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/31961) hosted keys for encryption, which may incur additional charges:
  - SecretsManager creates default Tencent Cloud managed CMKs in KMS for free. In addition, KMS allows you to call APIs 20,000 times for free. Therefore, if you use default Tencent Cloud managed CMKs and the number of API calls is within 20,000, no additional charge will be incurred.
  - If you have created a custom encryption key, or the number of SSM API calls has exceeded 20,000, you will be charged for the KMS service. For more information, please see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/31966).

- Secret storage fees: 0.4 (USD/secret/month) * 100 = 40 (USD)
- API call fees: 20 (calls) * 100 (secrets) * 30 (days) * 0.05 (USD/10,000 calls) = 0.3 (USD)
- Total: 40 (USD) + 0.3 (USD) = 40.3 (USD)
