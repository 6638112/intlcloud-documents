Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) provides a convenient and secure management platform for user signup, login, and access. It reduces the risk of malicious user signup and helps you build a unified and optimized user ID and user consent management system.

CIAM has the following features:

- Efficient management services and rich SDKs/APIs, which help platforms quickly set up signup, login, and authentication processes.
- Flexible policy and risk management configuration capabilities, which effectively identify malicious users and lower business risks.
- Account integration and management tools, which can manage the same users from different channels after they authorize information collection. This improves the user experience of accessing applications through different channels.
- A unified 360Â° user view to better understand users and provide services.
