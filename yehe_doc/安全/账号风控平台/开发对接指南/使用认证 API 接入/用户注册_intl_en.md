## API Description
This API is used to sign up a new user. This API is suitable for **automatic application sign-up development scenarios**. If your application uses the Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) authentication portal, see [Sign up via Authentication Portal](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1148/51469).

Before calling this API, make sure that the application sign-up process has been configured and enabled. Input parameters of the API need to follow the rules of the application configured for the sign-up process. For example, if the mobile number is set as a authentication attribute and the username as the required general attribute for the sign-up process, the input parameters must contain the mobile number and the username. **If the mobile number is not set as a authentication attribute for sign-up, the input parameters cannot contain the mobile number**.

When the sign-up information contains a mobile number or email address, you need to call the [API for sending one-time password (OTP) verification code](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1148/51475) to send the verification code to the user.

Password is an optional parameter, which can be set as needed.
- If users only log in via SMS OTP, email OTP or social authentication, no password is required.
- If users are allowed to log in by account and password authentication, a password should be set.

If you need to set a password, make sure that the **authentication source of account and password is associated** in the login process of the application. The API will verify the passed password according to the password policies of the authentication source. If the password does not meet the policy requirements, the sign-up will fail.
>?
>- The user groups cannot be set via this API. Users who has signed up are included in the user group configured in the sign-up process by default.
>- This API does not handle automatic login and identity verification logic. The configurations of automatic login and identity verification in the sign-up process do not take effect on this API.
