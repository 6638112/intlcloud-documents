## What deployment modes does CIAM support?

It can be deployed in public, private, and hybrid clouds.

## How do I set my own domain name?

CIAM allows you to configure your own or Tencent Cloud domain names in the following steps: deploy an SSL certificate, configure the DNS, and then make the domain name take effect. If you don't configure a custom domain name, the default one will be used.
