## Enhanced Consumer Account Management Capabilities

CIAM supports the access management of various social login methods in the WeChat and QQ ecosystems, such as QR code scan on PC, official account, or mini program, as well as in other non-Tencent ecosystems. It integrates user signup information and progressive data processing capabilities to help you create unique IDs for user accounts, laying the groundwork for user management and targeted marketing.

## Optimized User Experience

CIAM unifies the user login entry and SSO in multiple channels and terminals, including web, HTML5, app, applet, IoT, VR, and AR. This delivers an easier and better user experience, facilitates cross-business collaboration, and improves consumer user retention and activity.

## Effective Malicious User Identification

CIAM can be connected to Tencent's diverse risk management solutions (purchased and configured separately). Then, based on Tencent Security's over 20 years of experience in combating black market activities, it effectively identifies malicious users for you to filter user behaviors such as malicious signup and bargain hunting and reduce potential business losses.

## Multiple Deployment Modes

CIAM supports deployment in public, private, and hybrid clouds as needed to help you uniformly manage user accounts in the cloud. This reduces your management costs and improves the security.

## High Stability and Reliability

CIAM can sustain hundreds of millions of users, with a high stability proven by its large-scale internet use cases.
