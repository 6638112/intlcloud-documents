Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is used to manage the account, registration, and authentication rules of public internet users. It breaks through scattered user data silos and helps applications better identify and profile users.


For business operators, if user account data is scattered in multiple applications, it is impossible for them to accurately understand users and provide personalized services. In the absence of a unified management perspective, cybercriminals may attack businesses, leading to business losses.

CIAM provides the following features:
- Out-of-the-box authentication services and rich SDKs/APIs, which help platforms quickly set up registration, login, and authentication processes.
- Flexible policy configuration capabilities, which work together with risk management policies to effectively identify malicious users and avoid business losses.
- Interconnection with existing account systems, so users don't need to register repeatedly; instead, they can access applications from any channel. This delivers a consistently excellent user experience and greatly reduces the churn rate.
- A unified 360Â° user view to better understand users and provide personalized services.
