### What deployment modes does CIAM support?[](id:Q1)
CIAM supports two deployment modes: public cloud deployment and on-premises deployment.

### What are the differences between CIAM and EIAM?[](id:Q2)
- Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) is oriented to internet users and helps developers quickly implement know-your-customer (KYC), sync discrete user data, and better profile users, so as to quickly identify users from any channels (app, PC browser, and phone).
CIAM focuses on better access experience and supports passwordless authentication, cross-platform integration, risk management (with malicious user identification), and compliance management.
- Enterprise Identity Access Management (EIAM) is oriented to enterprise internal management and helps enterprises manage employee accounts, assign application permissions, and configure identity verification methods for application access. It focuses on full-lifecycle employee account management and fine-grained permission management and supports complicated organizational structures, flexible access control rules, and diverse permission models.

### What are the differences between CIAM, CDP, and DMP?[](id:Q3)
- Data Management Platform (DMP) enables you to place ads based on third-party data (from various ad platforms such as Tencent Social Ads) to expose your brand and attract users.
- Customer Data Platform (CDP) collects, unifies, and classifies customer data (including first-party data) to help you better reach users through user profiling and automated marketing.
- CIAM focuses on user registration and identity data sync, improves user access experience, and reduces the user churn rate through social login and passwordless authentication. In addition, it integrates Tencent's security capabilities of combating cybercrimes to filter malicious users and help you prevent business losses.
In conclusion, CIAM can form linkages with DMP and CDP to supplement them in various dimensions such as identity verification, access control, and risk identification.
