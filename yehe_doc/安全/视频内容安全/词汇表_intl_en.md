### Optical Character Recognition
Optical character recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts the text in various documents, newspapers, books, manuscripts, and other printed materials into image information through optical input methods such as scanning and then converts such information into computer-readable input through text recognition technology.

### Processing Volume
VM calculates the recognition processing volume by hour and converts it into image frame capturing and audio segmenting as the recognition granularities.

### Image Library
You can add image content not covered by VM models to a custom image library, where you can define image attributes such as normal, pornographic, illegal, and non-compliant.

### Dictionary
You can add business-specific text content to a custom dictionary, where you can define keyword attributes such as normal, pornographic, illegal, and non-compliant.

### Frame
A frame is a static image generated by capturing the current dynamic video during video recognition. Video recognition is usually conducted by means of frame capturing and sampling.
