This document describes how to connect to and use VM.
## Getting Account Information
### Getting Tencent Cloud account
Log in to the [Tencent Cloud console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) to sign up and verify your identity as instructed in [Signing up for a Tencent Cloud Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985). You can skip this step if you already have a Tencent Cloud account.

### Getting Tencent Cloud API access key
Tencent Cloud uses `secretid` and `secretkey` to verify your identity and permissions. You can get the Tencent Cloud API access key in the following steps:
1. Go to the [TencentCloud API key management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page and select **CAM** > **API Key Management** on the left sidebar to enter the API key management page.
2. Click **Create Key** to create a key and save the `secretid` and `secretkey` for subsequent API calls. You can skip this step if you already have a Tencent Cloud key.

## Configuring in Console
### Activating service
Log in to the [CMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cms/video/overview) and click **Activate Now**. You will be gifted a free trial package of **600 minutes** (equivalent to **36,000 images** and **600 minutes of audio**) valid for **one month**.
### Configuring permission
If you want to call VM through a sub-account, you need to authorize it by assigning a policy in the following steps:
1. Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/overview) and select **User** > **User List** on the left sidebar to enter the **User List** page.
2. On the **User List** page, find the target sub-account and click **Authorize** in the **Operation** column to pop up the **Associate Policy** window.
>? For more information on CAM, see [CAM Authorization Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1140/44981).

### Configuring custom policy (optional)
>? This step is optional. If you don't use a custom recognition policy, you can use the default policy (by leaving the `Biztype` field empty when calling APIs) for content recognition.

If your business scenarios require a custom recognition policy for video content, you can configure one in **Policy Management** in the following steps:
1. Log in to the [CMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cms/video/strategy) and select **VM** > **Policy Management** on the left sidebar to enter the **Policy Management** page.
2. On the **Policy Management** page, click **Create Policy** in the top-left corner to enter the **Create Policy** page.
3. Enter the policy information based on your business scenario, reserve the `Biztype` field as an API input parameter, and click **Next**.
