## Challenges in Content Moderation

With the rapid development of the internet, smart devices, and various emerging businesses, internet data has been growing explosively and is subject to diverse uncontrollable risks, such as pornographic images, terrorism content, and spam ads.

With ever heightened regulation, content involving violence, blood, porn, gambling, and drug use has become an area of focus, which makes content moderation an urgent need of short video, news, and live streaming platforms.

As common violent, ironic, and suggestive content in images are difficult and costly to recognize and moderate through traditional means, enterprises face new technical challenges in content operations.

## IMS Overview

Tencent Cloud Image Moderation System (IMS) is a security service with cutting-edge image recognition algorithms, which are trained with massive amounts of data in non-compliant images to create a model for recognizing the images uploaded by users. It delivers a high recognition accuracy and recall rate, meets the needs for content moderation in multiple dimensions, and has been constantly improved in its recognition standards and capabilities in response to the changing regulatory requirements.

- It can detect various scenes in images and accurately recognize content that may be offensive, unsafe, or inappropriate, which effectively reduces the risks of non-compliant content and moderation costs.
- It can accurately recognize content that involves porn, terrorism, and violence and allows you to configure an image blocklist to filter images of custom violation types. The recognition results include three categories: normal, suspected, and non-compliant. We recommend you allow normal images, manually moderate suspected images, and block non-compliant images, so as to reduce the labor costs and increase the moderation efficiency.
- It provides services and capabilities in the form of open APIs. You can call them to get moderation results and efficiently create a smart business system to increase the efficiency of business operations.
