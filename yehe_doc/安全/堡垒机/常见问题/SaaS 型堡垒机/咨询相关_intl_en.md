### Can I still connect to the IP of a CVM instance after purchasing the BH service?
The BH service itself does not modify your CVM security group. If you have not configured another security group, you can still make the connection through the IP of your CVM instance. For Ops compliance and audit integrity, we recommend you configure a security group policy to allow CVM login and Ops operations only through BH.

Yes, as long as the network is connected.

### What remote tools can work with BH?

- macOS clients: MRD, iTerm, Mac Terminal, SecureCRT, FileZilla, Transmit, and weterm.
