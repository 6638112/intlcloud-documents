This document describes the advantages of CWPP.

## Advantages
Tencent Cloud CWPP has the following advantages: 

| Advantage | Tencent Cloud CWPP | Other host security products |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hacking behavior detection | Based on the threat data collected from the entire Internet, CWPP is able to detect hacker attacks in real time. | Determination is made based on the single-server behavior data with weak detection ability and slow response. |
| Trojan file detection | The CWPP backend is integrated with the new-gen TAV anti-virus engine of Tencent PC Manager and the Hubble Analysis System to respond to unknown risks instantly. Its machine learning-based WebShell detection engine can effectively combat encrypted and disguised malicious scripts. | In the absence of the ability to detect executable malicious files, WebShell detection is only conducted based on regular expressions and character logic matching, which can lead to a lot of false positives and false negatives. |
| Installation and ops free | The ops information of cloud platform servers can be automatically associated, which can be used after you purchase a CVM, Lighthouse, or ECM instance. Security policies are automatically updated in the cloud, with no manual maintenance of various security detection scripts required. | You need to log in to individual servers to manually install the product, and personnel with certain security knowledge are required to configure security policies. |
| Centralized management | Security events can be managed in the console in a centralized manner, eliminating your need to log in to multiple servers. Centralized management of server assets enables you to quickly construct a visualized security platform. | You need to log in to individual servers to address security events one by one. |
| Low resource consumption | With self-developed lightweight agents, CWPP carries out most of its computing and protection workload in the cloud, ensuring low consumption of server resources. | Software clients consume a high amount of memory resources (generally over 100 MB), which may compromise server performance during peak hours. |
