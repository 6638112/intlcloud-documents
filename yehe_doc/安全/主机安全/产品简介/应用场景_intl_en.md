This document describes the common use cases of CWPP.

## Scenarios
When your server is compromised, you will face the following security risks:

- Business interruption: Databases and files are tampered with or deleted, resulting in inaccessible services and system paralysis.
- Data theft: Hackers steal your data and sell it publicly, leading to customer privacy leaks, and thus causing customer churn and damage to your brand image.
- File encryption by ransomware: Hackers intrude into your server and implant irreversible ransomware to encrypt your data for ransom.
- Service instability: Hackers run mining programs and DDoS Trojans on your server to gain financial benefits, which consumes a large amount of system resources, thus causing the failure of the server to provide services.

CWPP can effectively prevent the above problems and ensure the security of your servers.
