This document introduces the modules on the security overview page and the operations of each module.
## Overview
As the server security information display and processing center, the [Security Overview](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cwp) page of CWP can display the server health check score, protection status, risks to be processed, risk trend, and real-time server security status. In addition, you can refer to CWP help documentation and suggestions on CWP upgrade service, helping you defend against intrusions and attack threats to protect your workload security.
## Directions
Log in to the [CWP Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cwp) and click **Security Overview** on the left sidebar to enter the security overview page where security overview information and relevant operations are displayed. Each module is described as follows:
### Upgrade prompt
If CWP Pro is not used for your servers, a prompt to install or upgrade to CWP Pro will be displayed at the top of the **Security Overview** page. You also can find the entry to upgrade and relevant links.
- Click **[Upgrade to CWP Pro](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing)** to switch to the upgrade page. You can make a payment to upgrade from CWP Basic to CWP Pro for those servers for more powerful risk and threat defense capabilities.
- Click **[Learn More](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/296/12236)** to view the product documentation and know more about the product features and operations.

### Server security health check
 The server security health check feature can score your servers through security health checks and provide the numbers of servers and security risks. Click **Process Now** to enter the risk processing page where you can directly process detected intrusions and network defense risks and manage vulnerabilities.

 The server security status has the following three levels:

| Level | Health Check Score | Font Color |Description|
|---------|---------|---------|---|
|Low|90–100|Green|Your asset security status is excellent. Please maintain the status and perform routine inspection.|
|Medium|60–89|Orange|Your asset has many security risks. You are recommended to solve them promptly.|
|High|20–59|Red|Your asset has severe security risks. Please solve them as soon as possible.|

>? The lowest health check score for server security is 20.

The score penalties are calculated by security event category. The security event levels and penalty rules are as follows:

| Level|Security Event (Counted by Event Quantity) | Penalty Per Event | Maximum Total Penalty |
|---------|---------|---------|-|
|Severe|Trojan, virus, and successful intrusion.|-50|-80|
|High|High-risk vulnerability, high-risk baseline risk, and unusual login.|-10|-60|
|Medium|Medium-risk vulnerability and baseline risk.|-3|-30|
|Low|Low-risk vulnerability and baseline risk.|-2|-20|
|Other|CWP Basic (unprotected status).|-1|-10|

#### Protection status
The protection status section displays a wide range of information including the number of online severs, number of online servers using CWP Pro, number of online servers using CWP Basic, number of online CWP agents, number of servers that are shut down or offline and number of servers without CWP agents installed. It also display the asset update date, virus library date, vulnerability library date and security engine protection information.

- In the detection module of CWP Basic, click **[Upgrade to Pro](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing)** to enter the CWP upgrade page. You can make a payment to upgrade from CWP Basic to CWP Pro for those servers for more powerful risk and threat defense capabilities.
- Security engine protection will display 6 engine icons, which represent engines of cloud-based antivirus, AI, virtual machine detection, exception analysis, threat intelligence, and attack protection, respectively. If you have not activated CWP Pro, these icons are grayed out until you activate it.

### Pending risks
The pending risks section displays the number of server risks to be processed and the number of affected servers. You can click a risk event or its occurrence quantity to enter the corresponding risk processing page.

The data of pending risks is synced in real time and can be divided into the following 4 categories:

- **Intrusions**: this module provides detection and auditing for 7 types of intrusions, namely, trojans, unauthorized logins, brute force attacks, malicious requests, reverse shells, local privilege escalation, and high-risk commands. It also displays the numbers of risks and affected servers.
- **Vulnerabilities**: this module detects vulnerabilities in web applications and system components and displays the numbers of vulnerabilities and affected servers.
- **Security baseline**: this module only displays the numbers of baseline risks and affected servers.
- **Network attacks**: this module displays the numbers of attacks and affected servers.

### Risk trend
The risk trend section displays a line chart of the trend in security risks and threats in the last 7, 14, or 30 days and allows you to view the trend by time period. You can hover your mouse on the trend chart to view the numbers of risks and threats such as trojans, viruses, brute force attacks, suspicious logins, vulnerabilities, and baseline risks on the corresponding date.
>?The data that comes from the number of new pending events on the day is updated every hour, while the number of historical events will be retained and will not be changed.
