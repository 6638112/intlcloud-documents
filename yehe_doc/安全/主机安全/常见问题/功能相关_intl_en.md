### How to back up data automatically using snapshots?
Snapshot is a data backup method provided by Tencent Cloud. It can create a fully-available duplicate of the specified cloud disk, whose lifecycle is independent of the lifecycle of the original cloud disk. You can create snapshots regularly to quickly recover data in case of accidental data loss.
You can create a snapshot in the console as instructed below:
1. Log in to the [CBS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cbs/index?rid=1).
2. Locate the row of the instance for which you want to create a snapshot, and then click **Create Snapshot**.
3. Enter a name for the snapshot, confirm other configurations, and then click **Submit**.

For more information, see [Snapshot Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31638) and [Creating Snapshots](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5755).
