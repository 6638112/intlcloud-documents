#### 2.1 Get to know different CWP editions
CWP is now available in Basic and Pro editions. For more information, see [Features in Different Editions](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/296/2222).

#### 2.2 Purchase a CWP service
Before using CWP, you need to [sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) and [verify your identity](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629). For CWP Basic, you can use it free of charge. For CWP Pro, you need to [purchase your edition](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/yunjing). See [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/296/34667) for more information.

#### 2.3 Install a CWP agent
Your CWP agent can be installed together with a CVM instance (including CPMs) or installed separately. For details, see [Quick Start](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/296/12236).

#### 2.4 Configure your CWP agent
CWP can process and display the server security information in real time. With the CWP agent installed, you can configure it to detect and isolate Trojan files, detect vulnerabilities and suspicious logins, create allowlists, prevent password cracking and set alarms. For details, see [Operation Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/296/35234).

#### 2.5 Troubleshooting
If your server is intruded, you can perform troubleshooting by referring to the troubleshooting guide to restore the website or system.
