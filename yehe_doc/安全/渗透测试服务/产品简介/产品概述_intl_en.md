## Customer Benefits
### Technical security verification
As an independent security technology service, PTS mainly aims to verify the technical security of the entire target system. Penetration tests can also be performed on key businesses as an important means to discover and verify system risks. System security can be quantitatively analyzed at the technology level through penetration tests.

### Security risk discovery
A penetration test creates a serial path for traditional security vulnerabilities and then simulates an intrusion by exploiting the path. In the entire process, a hacker intrusion is simulated to effectively verify the presence and exploitability of each security risk and identify the most urgent security issues. This eventually reflects the security level of the system with straightforward results.

### Basis for security hardening
The results of penetration tests and tool scans serve as important inputs to future security planning and hardening. In particular, the test results can be used as case studies during security awareness training for internal security personnel.

### Improvement of security skills
PTS offers professional test reports, which can be used as cases and references during the study of common security principles.
