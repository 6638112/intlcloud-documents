 DDoS Edge Defender supports blocking inbound traffic by blocking protocols such as ICMP, TCP and UDP. When you complete the configuration, the access requests will be blocked directly. Of these protocols, UDP as a connectionless protocol dose not provide a three-way handshake process like TCP, and thus has security vulnerabilities. We recommend blocking UDP if it is not used for your application.
