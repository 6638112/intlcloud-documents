 DDoS Edge Defender supports configuring custom blocking policies against specific IP, TCP, UDP message header and payload. After enabling feature filtering, you can combine the matching conditions of the source port, destination port, message length, IP message header and payload, and set the protection action to continue protection, allow/block/discard matched requests, block the IP for 15 minutes, or discard the request and then block the IP for 15 minutes, etc. With feature filtering, you can configure accurate protection policies against business message features or attack message features.
