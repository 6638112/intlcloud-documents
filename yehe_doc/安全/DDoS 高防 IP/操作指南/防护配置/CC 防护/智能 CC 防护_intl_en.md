Intelligent CC protection is an AI-powered protection feature leveraging Tencent Cloud's big data capability. It provides a dynamic protection model to auto-generate rules for detecting and blocking malicious attacks based on website traffic patterns and algorithm-utilized attack analysis.
>?This feature is currently only available to beta users.

## Preparation
- You have purchased an [Anti-DDoS Advanced instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/297/37241) and set the object to protect.
- Only rules configured for instances accessing via domain names take effect.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-advanced/config/port). Select **Anti-DDoS Advanced (New)** > **Configurations** on the left sidebar. Open the **CC Protection** tab.
2. Select a domain name from the IP list on the left.

3. In the "CC Protection and Cleansing Threshold" card, click ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9795d7ce17dc03f5be0daae4ef488f98.png) and set a cleansing threshold before enabling intelligent CC protection.

>- The cleansing threshold is the threshold for Anti-DDoS services to start cleansing traffic. If the number of HTTP requests sent to the specified domain name exceeds the threshold, CC protection will be triggered.
>- If the IP bound to the Anti-DDoS Pro instance is from WAF, you need to first enable CC protection for the IP in the [WAF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/guanjia/tea-baseconfig). For more information, see [CC Protection Rules](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/627/11709).

5. When itâ€™s enabled, protection rules are auto-generated and only effective for each attack. Once a single attack ends, the protection rules will automatically expire and be removed. If you need to make changes to the rules you create, you can click **View** on the right to edit.
