## Prerequisites
You have purchased an [Anti-DDoS Advanced instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/297/37241) and set the object to protect.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Advanced Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-advanced/config/port) and select **Anti-DDoS Advanced (New)** > **Configurations** on the left sidebar.
2. Select an Anti-DDoS Advanced instance ID in the list on the left, such as "bgpip-xxxxxx".
