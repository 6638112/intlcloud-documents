Anti-DDoS supports AI protection. After AI protection is enabled, with its algorithms, Anti-DDoS can self-learn the connection quantity baseline and traffic characteristics, adaptively adjust cleansing policies, discover and block layer-4 connection CC attacks to deliver an optimal protection effect.

## Prerequisites
Purchase an [Anti-DDoS Advanced instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/297/37241) and set the object to be protected.

## Operation Directions
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-advanced/package) and click **Anti-DDoS Advanced (New)** -> **Configurations** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the ID or port of a protected IP from the left list, e.g., **212.64.xx.xx bgpip-000002jt** or **119.28.xx.xx bgpip-000002ju** -> **tcp:8000**. Click **Set** in the **AI Protection** section to enter the AI protection list.
