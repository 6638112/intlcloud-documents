The non-website business protection service of Anti-DDoS Advanced provides IP-based session persistence to support forwarding requests from the same IP address to the same real server for processing.
Layer-4 forwarding supports simple session persistence. The session persistence duration can be set to any integer between 30 and 3,600 seconds. If the time threshold is exceeded and the session has no new request, the connection will be automatically closed.
