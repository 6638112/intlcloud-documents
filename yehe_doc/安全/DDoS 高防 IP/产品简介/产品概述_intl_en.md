## Overview
Anti-DDoS Advanced is a paid protection service defending businesses such as games, internet services, and finance operations against DDoS attacks that may disable user access. It directs public network traffic in two ways: via pointing your business IP to Anti-DDoS Advanced or resolving your domain name to CNAME address, where attack traffic is redirected to its cleansing center for cleansing and access traffic is forwarded to the origin server. In this way, your business stability and availability can be ensured.

Anti-DDoS Advanced can be accessed via public network proxy and supports TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP2 protocols, making it well suited for finance, e-commerce, games and other business use cases.

| DDoS protection at the application layer | Filters out CC attacks, and supports HTTP custom filtering such as host filtering, user-agent filtering and referer filtering. |

### Security protection policy
Anti-DDoS Advanced provides basic security protection based on IP reputation and behavior pattern analysis and AI recognition algorithms. Meanwhile, policies can be customized to suit your needs.

### Customizable cleansing threshold
Anti-DDoS Advanced allows you to specify the protection level and cleansing threshold to meet your needs.

### IP unblocking 
When a large number of IP addresses are blocked due to attack traffic surges or low protection bandwidth, you can unblock them in the console.

### Protection statistics and analysis
Anti-DDoS Advanced provides visibility into statistical data of DDoS and CC attacks and forwarding traffic, keeping you updated on your business security. It also supports automatic packet capture to locate exceptions.
