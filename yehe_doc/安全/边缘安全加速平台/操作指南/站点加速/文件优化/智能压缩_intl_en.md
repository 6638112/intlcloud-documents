## Overview
Smart Compression can automatically compress the resources to Gzip/Brotli files to reduce the files size and shorten the resource loading time.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EdgeOne console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone). Click **Site Acceleration** > **File Optimization** on the left sidebar.
2. On the page that appears, select a site, and toggle on/off Smart Compression.

**Parameter description:**
 - **On** (default): Smart compression is enabled.

>! To use smart compression, the client request must include the "Accept-Encoding: gzip (or br)" header. If both compression methods are enabled, Brotli compression takes priority.

 - **Off**: Smart compression is disabled.
