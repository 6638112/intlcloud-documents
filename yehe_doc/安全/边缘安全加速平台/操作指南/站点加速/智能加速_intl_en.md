## Overview
Smart acceleration refers to smart dynamic routing acceleration. After this feature is enabled, it will detect the node network latency in real time and use the smart algorithm to select the optimal transfer path, so as to handle both static and dynamic client requests more quickly, stably, and securely.

Smart dynamic routing minimizes problems such as high network latency, connection errors, and request failures.

#### What are dynamic and static resources?
- Static resource: It refers to the content that stays the **same** in the responses to multiple requests for the same resource, such as HTML, CSS and JS files, images, videos, software installation packages, APK files, and compressed files.
- Dynamic resource: It refers to the content that **varies** in the responses to multiple requests for the same resource, such as APIs and JSP, ASP, PHP, PERL, and CGI files.

## Overview
#### Dynamic resource acceleration
Smart acceleration can be used for businesses with frequent requests to dynamic resources and a high sensitivity to latency, including online game, ecommerce, finance, payment, and online education.

#### Dynamic/Static hybrid resource acceleration
Dynamic resources are as detailed above. Static resources are cached on edge nodes close to clients for fast response. If a cached static resource expires, it can be updated quickly through smart acceleration.
