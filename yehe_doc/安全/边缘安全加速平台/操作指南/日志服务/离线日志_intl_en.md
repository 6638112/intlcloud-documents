## Overview
EdgeOne nodes respond to most of the user requests. To facilitate access analysis, EdgeOne packages access logs of the entire network at an hourly granularity and retains them for 30 days by default. These logs can also be downloaded.

> ?Currently, only node access logs of sites accelerated are provided.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EdgeOne console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/edgeone). Click **Log Service** > **Offline Logs** on the left sidebar.
>?The EdgeOne console is not yet fully available. To access the console, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-us) for activation.

2. On the offline logs page, select a site or the offline logs of a subdomain name. You can also filter offline logs by time.

> - The access logs are packed every hour by default. If the selected domain name is not requested during one hour, no log pack will be generated for this hour.
> - Each log pack is compressed to `.gz` format through gzip.
> - EdgeOne nodes are distributed over the globe. To synchronize all time zones, offline logs are stored and queried in UTC+00:00 by default.
>- Offline logs are collected from each EdgeOne node, so the delay may vary. Generally, querying and downloading of log packs can be delayed by about 30 minutes. Log packs will be added continuously and will stabilize after 2-3 hours.

## Field Description
Logs are stored in JSON format by default. The log fields are described as follows:
When a field is not specified:
- For a string field, the field value is set to `-` if the field has no data.
- For an integer field, the field value is set to `-1` if the field has no data.

### Notes
- The traffic/bandwidth data calculated based on the number of bytes recorded in the fifth field of an access log may be different from the billable EdgeOne traffic/bandwidth data for the following reasons:
   - Only application-layer data can be recorded in access logs. During actual data transfer, the traffic generated over the network is around 5-15% more than the application-layer traffic, including the following two parts:
     - Consumption by TCP/IP headers: in TCP/IP-based HTTP requests, each packet has a maximum size of 1,500 bytes and includes TCP and IP headers of 40 bytes, which generate traffic during transfer but cannot be counted by the application layer. The overhead of this part is around 3%.
     - TCP retransmission: during normal data transfer over the network, around 3% to 10% of packets are lost on the Internet and retransmitted by the server. This type of traffic, which accounts for 3-7% of the total traffic, cannot be counted at the application layer.
- After smart acceleration is enabled, Tencent Cloud EdgeOne will bill traffic/bandwidth generated by client requests on EdgeOne nodes.
- Due to defects of the MacOS directory system, an error will be reported when you double-click some data packs you want to decompress on MacOS. In this case, you can use the following Terminal commands:
```js.
gunzip {your_file_name}.log.gz 
```
