## Overview
EdgeOne's real-time log feature can collect and publish access logs in real time, enabling fast retrieval and analysis of log data. You can quickly access comprehensive, stable, and reliable one-stop logging services such as log collection, log storage, and log search in the EdgeOne console.
>?The EdgeOne console is not yet fully available. To access the console, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-us) for activation.


## Use Cases
You can access log data to view or analyze business conditions in multiple dimensions in real time.


## Prerequisites

You can manage modules such as logsets in [CLS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/overview); for example, you can rename logsets.

## Glossary
#### Logset
A logset is a project management unit in CLS. It is used to distinguish between logs of different projects and corresponds to a set. An EdgeOne logset has the following basic attributes:
- Region: The [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/18940) to which a logset belongs.
- Logset name: The name of a logset.
- Retention period: The retention period of data in the current logset.
- Creation time: Logset creation time.

#### Log topic
A log topic is the basic management unit in the Tencent Cloud log service (CLS). One logset can contain multiple log topics, and one log topic corresponds to one type of application or service. We recommend you collect similar logs on different machines into the same log topic. For example, if a business project has three types of logs: operation log, application log, and access log, you can create a log topic for each type of log.

The log service system manages different log data based on different log topics. Each log topic can be configured with different data sources, index rules, and shipping rules. Therefore, a log topic is the basic unit for configuring and managing log data in the log service. You need to configure corresponding rules first after creating a log topic before you can perform log collection, search, analysis, and shipping.

Log topic features include:
- Collect logs to log topics.
- Store and manage logs based on log topics.
- Search and analyze logs by log topics.
- Ship logs to other platforms based on log topics.
- Download and consume logs from log topics.

>- The above information is quoted from the product documentation of [CLS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). If there are any differences, the CLS documentation shall prevail.
>- Each real-time log push task that ships logs to CLS pushes the logs of selected subdomains to the specified log topic.

## FAQs
#### Why can't I see certain log topics created in the CLS console in the EdgeOne console?
As EdgeOne console supports and displays the log information created by the EdgeOne role, i.e., real-time log service dedicated to EdgeOne, other logsets and log topics won't be synced to EdgeOne.

#### Why can't I find data by searching for real-time logs? What can I do if data loss occurs?
It may be because your log data volume is large, but the corresponding log topic has only a single partition, or automatic splitting is disabled for it. When you create a log topic, the default number of partitions is 1, and automatic splitting is enabled by default.

We recommend you estimate the number of required partitions based on your log volume and configure it in the advanced options in the [CLS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/search?region=ap-shanghai) console. For more information, see [Topic Partition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/33779).

#### Can I delete CLS logsets?
Yes. You need to log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls) to delete a logset. Before deleting it, you need to delete all its log topics. The deletion will be synced to EdgeOne. If you want to use logsets and log topics again, create them again in the EdgeOne console.
