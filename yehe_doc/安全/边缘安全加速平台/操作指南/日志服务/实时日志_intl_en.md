## Overview
EdgeOne provides the real-time logging feature to collect and ship access logs in real time, allowing for fast retrieval and analysis of log data. 

## Use Cases
You can access log data to view or analyze business conditions in multiple dimensions in real time.


## Prerequisites
Activate [CLS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls) and grant EdgeOne access to create free logsets.
>? Itâ€™s recommended to enable real-time logging by using a root account. If you are a sub-account or collaborator, you need to obtain the required permission.

## Glossary
#### Logset
A logset is a project management unit in CLS. It is used to distinguish between logs of different projects and corresponds to a set. An EdgeOne logset has the following basic attributes:
- Region: The [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/18940) to which a logset belongs.
- Logset name: The name of a logset.
- Retention period: The retention period of data in the current logset.
- Creation time: Logset creation time.

#### Log topics
A log topic is the basic management unit in the Tencent Cloud log service (CLS). One logset can contain multiple log topics, and one log topic corresponds to one type of application or service. We recommend you collect similar logs on different machines into the same log topic. For example, if a business project has three types of logs: operation log, application log, and access log, you can create a log topic for each type of log.

The log service system manages different log data based on different log topics. Each log topic can be configured with different data sources, index rules, and shipping rules. Therefore, a log topic is the basic unit for configuring and managing log data in the log service. You need to configure corresponding rules first after creating a log topic before you can perform log collection, search, analysis, and shipping.

Log topic features include:
- Collect logs to log topics.
- Store and manage logs based on log topics.
- Search and analyze logs by log topics.
- Ship logs to other platforms based on log topics.
- Download and consume logs from log topics.

>- For more information, see [CLS documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). 
>- Each real-time log push task ships logs of the selected subdomains to the corresponding log topic in CLS.

## FAQs
#### Some of the CLS log topics are not visible in the EdgeOne console. 
In the EdgeOne console, you can only see log topics created by using the EdgeOne role.

#### I cannot retrieve the data I want in the real-time logs. Are they lost?
It may be because your log data volume is large, but the corresponding log topic has only a single partition, or automatic splitting is disabled for it. When you create a log topic, the default number of partitions is 1, and automatic splitting is enabled by default.

We recommend you estimate the number of required partitions based on your log volume and configure it in the advanced options in the [CLS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/search?region=ap-shanghai) console. For more information, see [Topic Partition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/33779).

#### Can I delete CLS logsets?
Yes. You can delete the logsets in the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls). Note that to delete a logset, you need to delete all its log topics first. The deletion will be synced to EdgeOne.
