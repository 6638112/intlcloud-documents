### Data overview
The data overview module displays the overview of business access and security protection data of all sites. As data aggregation has a delay, all data is for reference only. For detailed data, see [Data Analysis](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1145/46196).

>! All data is client access log data (i.e., application layer data), which may differ from the data used for billing. The volume of data generated during actual network transfer will be greater than that of application layer data. For specific billable usage, the actual bill shall prevail.
