## Overview
A cache key is a unique identifier of a resource in the cache. You can customize it to suit your needs by setting the query string, HTTP request header and URL case, so that requested resources can be loaded faster.

You can create a custom cache key with the following configurations:
- Query string. For detailed instructions, see [Query String](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1145/46174).
- HTTP request header. Specify an HTTP header (such as Accept-Language;User-Agent) to be included in the cache key that will be added to the URL.
- Ignore URL case. For detailed instructions, see [Case Ignoring](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1145/46181).
