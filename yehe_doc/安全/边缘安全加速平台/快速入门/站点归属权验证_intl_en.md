## When to Verify Your Site
1. If your site is added for the first time and via CNAME, you need to complete site verification.
2. If your site is already added by another account, you can reclaim your site once itâ€™s verified.


## Method 1: DNS Verification
<dx-steps>
- Add the specified TXT record to the DNS settings at your DNS provider.
- Wait until the verification is completed. If the record does not take effect after a long time, you can click **Refresh** to trigger system verification.
- After the record takes effect, click **Verify**.
