## EdgeOne Overview
Tencent Cloud EdgeOne provides an acceleration and security solution based on Tencent edge nodes to safeguard diverse industries such as ecommerce, retail, finance service, content and news, and gaming and improve their user experience.

- Acceleration: Edge nodes are closer to users, which greatly reduce the data access latency, avoid data transfer jitters, and guarantee the stability and effectiveness during the transfer of massive amounts of data. In addition, EdgeOne has many acceleration features, including dynamic/static data acceleration, cross-border acceleration, and smart route optimization, to efficiently support latency-sensitive businesses.
- Security: Security protection services such as WAF and Anti-DDoS are provided. Nodes identify and block various layer-3/4/7 attack requests, cleanse DDoS attack traffic, and use the smart AI engine and bot policy engine to analyze the behaviors of web, bot, and CC attacks and update attack blocking policies. This helps prevent malicious requests from reaching your origin servers and guarantee a smooth and stable access to your business.
