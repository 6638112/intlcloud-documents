## End of the free trial
After the end of the seven-day free trial, the TCSS console will be locked, the service will be suspended, and Tencent Cloud will delete your data (the deletion time is subject to the specific Tencent Cloud operation). We recommend you export the needed data before the trial ends. You can purchase the TCSS service if needed.
