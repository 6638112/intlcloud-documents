This document describes the billing mode of the value-added feature of TCSS and how to purchase it.

## Billing overview
The value-added feature of TCSS supports image security scan.

## Billing mode
It is in prepaid mode and pay-as-you-go at 0.25 USD/image.

## Billing description
TCSS uniquely identifies an image by image ID. Each image uses a license, and when it is updated and its ID changes, a new license will be required.
>? For example, if you need to scan ten images and expect to update them ten times in total (which means all image IDs will change ten times in total) during the validity period of your purchased TCSS service, you need to set the number of container image security scans to be purchased to 20 (10 + 10).

## Enabling image security scan
- After purchasing the licenses for container image security scans, go to the [**Local Image**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcss/security/image) page, click **Batch licensing**, select the target images, and click **Confirm to assign**.
- After purchasing the licenses for container image security scans, go to the [**Repository Image**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tcss/security/imageStore) page, click **Batch licensing**, select the target images, and click **Confirm to assign**.
