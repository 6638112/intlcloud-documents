This document describes how to use the automatic asset inventory feature of asset management to visualize key assets, such as containers, images, and image repositories.
- Asset management data is automatically synced once every 24 hours. Manual sync is supported.
- Asset management supports collecting the information of ten types of assets: containers, local images, repository images, clusters, nodes, processes, ports, web services, running applications, and database applications.
- Currently, the following assets can be recognized:
<table>
<thead>
