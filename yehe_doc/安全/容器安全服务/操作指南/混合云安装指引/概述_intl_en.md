## Background
With the popularity of cloud migration, more and more medium and large enterprises adopt the hybrid cloud mode, as it is as cost-effective, agile, flexible, and easy to use as the public cloud and as controllable, secure, and highly available as the private cloud. The hybrid cloud management feature is launched to support connecting to non-Tencent Cloud instances for better unified management and container security monitoring.

## Feature overview
- ECM and Lighthouse instances can be automatically connected to TSCC.
- Non-Tencent Cloud instances can be manually connected to TSCC, such as those in the private cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Huawei Cloud, QingCloud, AWS, and UCloud.

## System compatibility

- RHEL: 6 and 7 (64-bit)
- Ubuntu: 9.10â€“18.04 (64-bit)
- Debian: 6, 7, 8, and 9 (64-bit)
