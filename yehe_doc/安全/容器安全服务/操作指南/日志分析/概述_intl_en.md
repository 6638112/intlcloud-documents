This document describes how to use the log analysis feature, view the container bash logs, container startup audit logs, and Kubernetes API audit logs, and configure and ship logs.

## Background
Log analysis provides container bash logs, container startup audit logs, and Kubernetes API audit logs, supports statement search and query, and offers visual report, statistical analysis, and export features. It helps you quickly query the business logs, trace the container security events, and improve the operations efficiency.
- Container bash logs: Provide bash log audit to help you trace abnormal processes.
- Container startup audit logs: Provide container startup log audit to help you log container startups.
- Kubernetes API audit logs: Help you log Kubernetes API calls.

We recommend you enable the log audit feature for core assets and purchase storage as needed for log data collection and retention.

TCSS Pro Edition provides the log collection feature. We recommend you purchase the Pro Edition and then log storage. If you have purchased log storage but the capacity becomes insufficient, the log analysis service will clear historical log data. We recommend you expand the storage capacity promptly.

## Prerequisites
Log analysis and storage is a value-added service of TCSS. You need to purchase it separately on the [TCSS purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/tcss).
