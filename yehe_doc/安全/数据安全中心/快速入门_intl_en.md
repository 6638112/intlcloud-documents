## Overview
This document describes how to quickly log in to DSGC.

## Prerequisites
Sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629) before activating DSGC.

## Directions
### Step 1. Role authorization
Log in to the [DSGC console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/dsgc). If you haven't activated this service yet, an activation reminder will be displayed. Click **Authorize** to redirect to the CAM page and complete the authorization, and then you can use all DSGC features normally.

### Step 2. Asset authorization
1. Log in to the [DSGC console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/dsgc) and click **Data Asset Sorting** > **Management and Authorization** on the left sidebar to enter the management and authorization page.
2. On the management and authorization page, DSGC has already pulled the list of relational TencentDB databases in your Tencent Cloud account. You only need to enter your account and password or click **Authorize**. DSGC also allows you to add and authorize self-built databases.

### Step 3. Identification task execution
After the assets are authorized, an identification task will be automatically created. You can view task details, set task parameters, and execute the task on the [Identification Task](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dsgc/task) page. You can also make DSGC automatically perform identification tasks periodically by enabling automatic identification.
