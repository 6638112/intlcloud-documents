Please carefully read and fully understand each and every provision hereof, and the provisions restricting or releasing certain liabilities, or otherwise related to your material rights and interests, are in bold font or underlined or otherwise brought to your special attention.**

**Please do not purchase the Service unless and until you have fully read, and completely understood and accepted all the terms hereof. By clicking “Agree”/ “Next”, or by purchasing or using the Service, or by otherwise accepting this Agreement, whether express or implied, you are deemed to have read, and agreed to be bound by, this Agreement. This Agreement shall then have legal effect on both you and Tencent Cloud, constituting a binding legal document on both parties.**

## 1. Terms and Definitions

#### 1.1 Tencent Cloud Data Security Center Service

Refers to sensitive data identification, classification and hierarchization, risk detection and other services provided by Tencent Cloud by connecting to your (the “**Client**”) data assets. The specific content of the services shall be subject to the Service you purchase, and the contents actually provided by Tencent Cloud.

#### 1.2 Service Month(s)

Service Month(s) refers to the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

#### 1.3 Total Number of Minutes within Service Month

Total Number of Minutes within Service Month(s) = the total number of days of the Service Month(s) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

#### 1.4 Service Unavailability

**Service Unavailability refers to the unavailability of the Service, which includes the following two types:**

**(1) Unavailability of management function: means that you cannot operate the relevant functional configuration items in the interface by the steps described in the operation guide, despite normal login of the service console within the scope of authorization.**

**(2) Unavailability of classification and hierarchization function: means that you cannot perform the operations such as data identification, classification and hierarchization to process the supportable data assets as committed in the operation guide through the Service, even though you make correct configuration in full compliance with the operation guide.**

#### 1.5 Service Downtime

Service Downtime = the time when the Service Unavailability is fixed – the time when the Service Unavailability starts. Such downtime will be calculated in minutes, and when the downtime, or an unrounded portion thereof, is less than sixty (60) seconds, it will be rounded up to one (1) minute. For example, if the time when the Service Unavailability starts is January 10 at 14:01:01, and the time when the Service Unavailability is fixed is January 10 at 15:01:29, the Service Downtime will be sixty (60) minutes and twenty-eight (28) seconds. Since twenty-eight (28) seconds is less than one (1) minute, it will be rounded up to one (1) minute, so the Service Downtime will be sixty-one (61) minutes.

#### 1.6 Service Downtime within Service Month(s) Calculated in Minutes

Service Downtime within Service Month(s) Calculated in Minutes refers to the total number of minutes of the Service Downtime within Service Month(s). For example, if the Service Unavailability takes places three times within Service Month(s), and the Service Downtime is 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes respectively, the Service Downtime within Service Month(s) Calculated in Minutes will be sixty (60) minutes.

## 2. Service Availability

####  2.1 Calculation of the Service Availability

Service Availability = {(Total number of minutes within Service Month(s) – Service Downtime within Service Month(s) Calculated in Minutes)/ Total number of minutes within Service Month(s)} × 100%.

#### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud should not be less than **99.9%**. If the Service fails to meet the Standard (except under circumstances for disclaimer of liabilities), you may claim compensation in accordance with Article 3 of this Agreement.

## 3. Compensation Plan

In respect of the Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the Standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

#### 3.1 Standards of Compensation

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher (not cash) **by Tencent Cloud, and you should use the voucher by abiding the voucher usage rules (including usage period, etc., subject to the voucher usage rules published on Tencent Cloud official website). Such voucher cannot be converted into cash, and no invoice will be issued with respect thereof. The voucher may only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account, and you cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2)If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned standard, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month separately, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such Service Month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall be the cash you have actually paid, excluding the portion deducted by vouchers, coupons, service fee reduction or exemption, etc.).

| Service Availability in a Service Month | Value of Compensational Voucher|
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Less than 99.9% but is or higher than 99.0%       | 10% of the Monthly Service Fee            |
| Less than 99.0% but is or higher than 98.0%       | 20% of the Monthly Service Fee            |
| Less than 98.0%                                   | 50% of the Monthly Service Fee            |

#### 3.2 Time Limit for Compensation Application

(1) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the Service Availability standard, you may **apply for compensation only through the support ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5th) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud shall prevail**.

(2) **You shall apply for compensation no later than the sixtieth (60th) calendar day following the end of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard**. If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein,**it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you**.

#### 3.3 Application Materials for Compensation

If you believe that the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you may apply for compensation within the period of time as stipulated under this SLA, and you should at least provide the following information together with your compensation application:

(1) a detailed description of the incident;

(2) the specific date, time, duration and other details related to the Service Unavailability;
