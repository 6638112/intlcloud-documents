## Web Security Status Quo
With the rapid development of internet technologies, the key business activities of many government agencies, institutions, and enterprises rely more on web applications. While such applications provide users with web-based information management systems, the risks faced by users are also increasing, mainly in the following two aspects:
- More and more security vulnerabilities are brought by the widespread use of web application systems.
- As internet technologies evolve, hacking has become increasingly rampant, and more and more hacking application tools have been used for attacks.
75% of information security attacks on the internet come from web applications, 2/3 of which are vulnerable. However, security investments for web applications only account for 10% of all information security investments. Web security protection is becoming growingly important.
