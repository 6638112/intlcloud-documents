## Symptom
The application suffered high-traffic attacks, causing the IP to be blocked and the application to be inaccessible.

## Possible Causes
- The protection traffic threshold is exceeded, leading to blocking.
- The attack is still ongoing, so the IP cannot be automatically unblocked.

## Solutions
By default, the IP blocking duration lasts for 2-24 hours (subject to the actual situation). In cases of security emergency, you can apply for emergency DDoS protection.
