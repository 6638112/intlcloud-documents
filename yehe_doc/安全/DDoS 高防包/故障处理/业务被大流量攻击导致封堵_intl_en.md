## Symptom
The application suffered high-traffic attacks, causing the IP to be blocked and the application to be inaccessible.

## Possible Causes
- The protection traffic threshold is exceeded, leading to blocking.
- The attack is still ongoing, so the IP cannot be automatically unblocked.

## Solutions
- Anti-DDoS Basic: By default, the IP blocking duration lasts for 2-24 hours (subject to the actual situation). In cases of security emergency, you can apply for emergency DDoS protection.
- Anti-DDoS Pro or Advanced user: Only **three** chances of manual unblocking are provided each day. The system resets the chance counter daily at midnight. Unused chances cannot be accumulated for the next day.

If the manual unblocking chances are used up:
- If you haven't purchased Anti-DDoS Pro, we recommend you purchase Anti-DDoS Pro. Then, you can perform unblocking when binding devices for the first time.
- If you have already purchased Anti-DDoS Pro, we recommend you upgrade the protection package so as to perform unblocking earlier.
