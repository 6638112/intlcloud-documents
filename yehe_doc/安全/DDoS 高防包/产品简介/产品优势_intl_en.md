Anti-DDoS Pro is a paid service that can enhance DDoS protection capabilities of Tencent Cloud services such as CVM, CLB, WAF, NAT Gateway, VPN Gateway and Lighthouse. It has the following strengths:
## One-Click Access
Anti-DDoS Pro is easy to access and requires no business changes on your end. After you purchase an instance, it only takes you a couple of minutes to get started. You only need to bind it to the Tencent Cloud services you want to protect.

## Dual-protocol Protection
Anti-DDoS Pro now supports both IPv6 and IPv4 address. By simply binding the IPs of your cloud products with an Anti-DDoS Pro instance, you can obtain DDoS protection, with no need to purchase an extra Anti-DDoS Pro instance or upgrade it.

## Massive Protection Resources
With ultra-large BGP protection bandwidth, Anti-DDoS Pro can cover a wide range of ISPs including China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile, providing security and stability for essential businesses such as promotional campaigns and launch events.

## Leading Cleansing Capability
Leveraging the powerful protective clusters developed by Tencent and multi-dimensional algorithms, such as IP profiling, behavior pattern analysis, and cookie challenges, Anti-DDoS Pro can accurately and promptly detect attack traffic. With the aid of a smart AI engine that continuously optimizes the algorithms, Anti-DDoS Pro is also flexible in coping with attack tricks.

## Fast Access
With a 30-line BGP network encompassing ISPs across the Chinese mainland, Anti-DDoS Pro can effectively reduce latency and increase access speed for various user groups.

## Detailed Protection Reports

## Lower Security Protection Costs
Anti-DDoS Pro offers a simplified billing mode where you are only charged by "number of protected IPs + protected times" you set for your business size and protection needs. When high-traffic attacks occur, the maximum DDoS protection capability of Tencent Cloud in the region of the Anti-DDoS Pro instance is reachable without extra payments.
