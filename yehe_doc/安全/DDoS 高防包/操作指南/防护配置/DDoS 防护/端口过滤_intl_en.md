Port filtering is a fine-grained way to restrict inbound traffic based on port. When it is enabled, you can create a rule by setting the protocol type, source port range, destination port range and action (Discard/Allow/Continue protection).


## Prerequisites
You have successfully purchased an [Anti-DDoS Pro](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/36115) instance and set the protected target.

## Directions
1. Log in to the new [Anti-DDoS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-native/package) and select **Anti-DDoS Pro (New)** > **Configurations** on the left sidebar. Open the **DDoS Protection** tab.
2. Select an Anti-DDoS Pro instance ID in the list on the left, such as "bgp-00xxxxxx".
