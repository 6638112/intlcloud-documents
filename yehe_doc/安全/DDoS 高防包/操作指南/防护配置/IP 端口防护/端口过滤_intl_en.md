Anti-DDoS enables you to block or allow inbound traffic by ports. With port filtering enabled, you can customize port settings against inbound traffic, including the protocol type, source port and destination port ranges and set the protection action (allow/block/discard) for the matched rule.


## Prerequisites
You have successfully purchased an [Anti-DDoS Pro](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/36115) instance and set the protected target.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Pro Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-native/package) and select **Anti-DDoS Pro (New)** > **Configurations** on the left sidebar.
Select an Anti-DDoS Pro instance ID in the list on the left, such as "bgp-00xxxxxx".
