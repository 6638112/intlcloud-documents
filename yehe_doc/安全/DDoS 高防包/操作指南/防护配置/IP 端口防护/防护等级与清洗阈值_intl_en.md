This guide describes protection levels the Anti-DDoS Pro provides in different scenarios and how to set them in the console.
## Use Cases
Anti-DDoS Pro provides three available protection levels for you to adjust protection policies against different DDoS attacks. The details are as follows:

<dx-tabs>
::: Loose
| Protection Level | Protection Action                                                     | Description                                                         |
| -------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Loose     | <li>Filters SYN and ACK data packets with explicit attack attributes.</li><li>Filters TCP, UDP, and ICMP data packets that are not compliant with the protocol specifications.</li><li>Filters UDP data packets with explicit attack attributes.</li> | <li>This cleansing policy is loose and only defends against explicit attack packets.</li><li>We recommend choosing this protection level when normal requests are blocked. Complex attack packets may pass through the security system.</li> |
:::
::: Medium
| Protection Level | Protection Action                                                     | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Medium     | <li>Filters SYN and ACK data packets with explicit attack attributes.</li><li>Filters TCP, UDP, and ICMP data packets that are not compliant with the protocol specifications.</li><li>Filters UDP data packets with explicit attack attributes.</li><li>Filters common UDP-based attack packets.</li><li>Actively verifies the source IPs of some access attempts.</li> | <li>Medium is the default level.</li><li>This cleansing policy is suitable for most businesses and capable of defending against common attacks.</li> |
:::
::: Strict
| Protection Level | Protection Action                                                     | Description                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Strict     | <li>Filters SYN and ACK data packets with explicit attack attributes.</li><li>Filters TCP, UDP, and ICMP data packets that are not compliant with the protocol specifications.</li><li>Strictly checks and filters UDP data packets with explicit attack attributes and UDP-based attack packets.</li><li>Actively verifies the source IPs of some access attempts.</li><li>Filters ICMP attack packets.</li> | This cleansing policy is strict. We recommend choosing this level when attack packets pass through the security system on Normal mode. |

>- If you need to use UDP in your business, please contact [Tencent Cloud Technical Support](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-us) to customize an ideal policy for not letting the level Strict affect normal business process.
>- The level Medium is chosen by default in each Anti-DDoS Pro instance.
>- The real server may suffer seconds of attacks in the following situations:
>  - It happens when you are changing the protection level.
>  - It happens when you are connecting to Anti-DDoS Pro.
