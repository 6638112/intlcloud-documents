Anti-DDoS Pro supports configuring CC frequency limiting rules for connected web businesses to restrict the access frequency of source IPs. You can customize a frequency limiting rule to apply CAPTCHA and discard on source IPs if any IP accesses a certain page too frequently in a short time.

## Prerequisites
You have successfully purchased an [Anti-DDoS Pro](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/36115) instance and set the protected target.
