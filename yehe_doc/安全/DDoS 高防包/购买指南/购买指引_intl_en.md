    - Protection capacity: All-out protection
    - Protection scope: Public IPs of Tencent Cloud resources such as CVM, CLB, GAAP and WAF
 - Region: Please select the region of the Tencent Cloud public IP. Currently, an Anti-DDoS Pro instance can only provide DDoS protection for Tencent Cloud public IPs in the same region.
 - Protected IPs: Number of public IPs to be protected by an Anti-DDoS Pro instance. Available specifications: 10 IPs (default), 50 IPs, and 100 IPs.
