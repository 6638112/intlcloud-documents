Tencent Cloud Anti-DDoS Pro has adopted new billing rules from **March 24, 2022**.
## Billing Mode

The new Anti-DDoS Pro service guarantees an all-out protection capability. Integrating the local cleansing capability, the all-out protection aims to spare no effort to successfully defend against each DDoS attack. In addition, the all-out protection will be enhanced along with the advance of Tencent Cloud network capabilities, and for which no extra upgrade costs are required.

>! Tencent Cloud reserves the right to restrict the traffic if the DDoS attacks on your business affect the infrastructure in the Tencent Cloud Anti-DDoS cleansing center. If the traffic of your Anti-DDoS Pro instance is restricted, your business may suffer the problems such as limited or blocked business access traffic.


| Billable Items      | Billing Mode  | Payment Method | Payment Description                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Number of protected IPs | Monthly subscription | Pay-as-you-go| Please select the number of business IPs to be protected by an Anti-DDoS Pro instance. Specification: 10 (default), 50, and 100.</br>If you need the protection for more IPs, extra fees will be charged. The number can only be increased but not decreased. |
| Protection bandwidth | Monthly subscription | Pay-as-you-go   | The protection bandwidth refers to the amount of your bandwidth used to protect and is billed by 95th percentile. The unit price is $14/Mbps/month. <br/>Anti-DDoS Pro allows you to exceed your planâ€™s limit, but the all-out protection capability will become not available and only the basic protection capability remains when the limit has been exceeded for 36 hours. |


>?
>- To use an Anti-DDoS Pro instance, please select the same instance region as your other Tencent Cloud resources such as CVM or CLB instances, and bind it to your business IP first.
>- 95th percentile bandwidth: In each calendar month, the inbound/outbound bandwidth is sampled every 5 minutes and the maximum is taken as the peak bandwidth on each day. At the end of the month, the sampled values are sorted from highest to lowest, and the top 5% are removed. The highest value in the remaining values is the billable bandwidth of the month.
## Pricing

A new Anti-DDoS Pro instance protects business IPs in the same region by default, and the number of protected IPs can be increased. If you need protection for multiple IPs in different regions, you need to purchase multiple instances. If you find the specifications are not ideal, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for customization.
