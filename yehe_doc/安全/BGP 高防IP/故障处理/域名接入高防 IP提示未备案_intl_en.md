## Possible Causes
#### The domain name does not have an ICP filing from the MIIT
Pursuant to the State Council Decree No.292 "Administrative Measures for Internet Information Services" and the "Measures for the Archival Administration of Non-operational Internet Information Services", China implements a licensing system for operational internet information services and filing system for non-operational internet information services. Internet information services shall not be provided before the license or filing is obtained; otherwise, it would be illegal.

Therefore, any website providing services in the Chinese mainland must first apply for ICP filing, and the website can be launched for access only after the ICP filing number is obtained from the competent communications administration.

#### The ICP filing information was not synced in time
If your domain name has been successfully filed with the MIIT, but the system prompted that the domain name has no ICP filing, it may be because that the ICP filing information of the MIIT has not been synced to the Tencent Cloud website ICP filing system.


## Troubleshooting Procedure
#### The domain name does not have an ICP filing from the MIIT
You can use the Tencent Cloud website ICP filing service for application. After the application is successful and the ICP filing number is obtained from the competent communications administration, your domain name can be connected to Anti-DDoS Advanced. 

>?If you have already applied for an ICP filing at another access provider, please consult the provider accordingly.

#### The ICP filing information was not synced in time
After you get your ICP filing, it takes some time to sync the information from the MIIT to Tencent Cloud ICP filing management system. Please wait 24 hours and try again.
