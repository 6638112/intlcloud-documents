## Overview
Anti-DDoS Advanced is a paid protection service defending businesses such as games, internet services, and finance operations against high-volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that may disable user access. It can direct attack traffic to Anti-DDoS Advanced IPs for cleansing, thus ensuring business stability and availability of the real servers.
Anti-DDoS Advanced can be connected to through internet proxy and supports TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 protocols, making it ideal for finance, ecommerce, games, and other business scenarios.

## Key Features
### Multidimensional protection
| Protection Type       | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Malformed packet filtering | Filters out frag flood, smurf, stream flood, and land flood attacks as well as malformed IP, TCP, and UDP packets |
| DDoS protection at the network layer | Filters out UDP flood, SYN flood, TCP flood, ICMP flood, ACK flood, FIN flood, RST flood, and DNS/NTP/SSDP reflection attacks and null sessions. |
| DDoS protection at the application layer | Filters out CC attacks and slow HTTP attacks, and supports HTTP custom filtering such as host filtering, user-agent filtering, and referer filtering. |

### Flexible advanced protection policies
Anti-DDoS Advanced provides basic security policies by default on the basis of protection algorithms such as IP profiling, behavior pattern analysis, and AI-based smart recognition, effectively coping with common DDoS attacks. Meanwhile, it provides advanced DDoS protection policies such as IP blacklist/whitelist, protocol/port closing, packet characteristic filtering, and null session prevention to enable more targeted protection, and you can customize them as needed.

### Custom cleansing mode
Anti-DDoS Advanced opens up its multiple protection levels and provides a custom cleansing threshold to allow flexible adjustment based on the attack characteristics, helping you swiftly respond to various types of DDoS attacks and meet your diversified business requirements.

### Protection statistics and analysis
You can access multidimensional statistics of DDoS attacks, CC attacks, forwarded traffic, and other metrics, which helps you stay up to date with your business and attack conditions. In addition, Anti-DDoS Advanced supports automatic capture of attack packets, helping you quickly troubleshoot exceptions and problems.

## Supported Regions
Anti-DDoS Advanced can protect all types of servers on the internet, including but not limited to those in customer IDCs, Tencent Cloud, and other clouds. It is currently available in following regions:

The table below describes the protection bandwidth of Anti-DDoS Advanced for different regions.

| Region | Base Protection | Elastic Protection | Maximum Protection Bandwidth |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Guangzhou     | 20–50 Gbps  | 30–100 Gbps | 100 Gbps      |
| Beijing     | 20–50 Gbps  | 30–100 Gbps | 100 Gbps      |
| Shanghai     | 20–100 Gbps | 30–300 Gbps | 300 Gbps      |
| Outside Mainland China | 10–100 Gbps | 30–400 Gbps | 400 Gbps      |
>You are recommended to choose a region closest to your real server so as to reduce access latency and accelerate access.
