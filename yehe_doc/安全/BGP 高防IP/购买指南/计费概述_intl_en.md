## Billing Mode
Anti-DDoS Advanced adopts a combo billing mode, utilizing both monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go. Specifically, base protection bandwidth, application bandwidth, and forwarding rules are on monthly subscription, while elastic protection bandwidth is pay-as-you-go on a daily billing cycle.

 might affect your service. We recommend adjusting your application bandwidth to avoid such occurrences.</td>

### Base Protection
Base protection is billed based on your monthly subscription plan. See the following table for detailed prices.

| Anti-DDoS Capacity | CC Protection Bandwidth | Non-BGP | BGP | Outside Chinese mainland |
|---------|---------|----|---------|---------|
| 20 Gbps | 40,000qps | -  |1,000 USD/month  | 4,800 USD/month |
| 50 Gbps | 150,000qps | 4,000 USD/month</br>25,000 USD/year  | 4,500 USD/month</br>35,000 USD/year | 10,500 USD/month  |

| 300 Gbps| 700,000qps | 60,000 USD/year  | 65,000 USD/year | - |

>
- “Non-BGP” refers to China Mobile/China Union/China Telecom network services. If purchased, you will be provided with three Anti-DDoS Advanced instances, one for each of them.
- “Outside Chinese mainland” refers to Tencent Cloud regions outside the Chinese mainland, namely, Hong Kong (China), Taiwan (China), Singapore, Seoul, Tokyo, and Virginia.

### Elastic Protection
You can enable elastic protection as needed.
- If elastic protection is not enabled for an instance, its maximum protection will be the base protection bandwidth, and no extra fees will incur.
- If elastic protection is enabled for an instance, its maximum protection will be the selected elastic protection bandwidth.
 - If elastic protection is not triggered, no charges will be incurred.
 - Elastic protection will be triggered when the peak attack traffic exceeds the base protection bandwidth. You will be billed on the following day based on the tiered price of the peak attack bandwidth for the current day.

See the following table for detailed prices.

| Billing Tier      |  Non-BGP (USD/day) | BGP (USD/day) | Outside Chinese mainland (USD/day)  |

### Forwarding Rules
| Number of Rules                      |  Price (USD/month per 10 rules) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Number of ports (or protected domains) ≤ 60  | Free               |
| Number of ports (or protected domains)  > 60 | 100                |

>The number of forwarding rules is the total number of TCP/UDP ports (for non-website connections) and HTTP/HTTPS domain names (for website connections) that you configure for an Anti-DDoS Advanced instance.

### Application Bandwidth
Application bandwidth is the bandwidth used for forwarding the application traffic that has been cleansed by the Tencent Cloud Anti-DDoS data center back to the data center on the real server.
It is billed by the monthly subscription plan. See the following table for detailed prices.

| Bandwidth | Price (USD/month) |
|-|-|
|50 Mbps|750 |
|100 Mbps|1,500 |
|150 Mbps|2,250 |
|200 Mbps|3,000|
|500 Mbps|7,500|
|1 Gbps|15,000|
|2 Gbps|30,000 |

The relationship between the application bandwidth and the number of Layer-7 requests is as shown in the following table.

| Application Bandwidth     |  HTTP/HTTPS    |
| -------- | -------- |
| 50Mbps    | 5,000QPS  |
| 100Mbps |  10,000QPS  |
| 150Mbps  | 15,000QPS  |
| 200Mbps  |  20,000QPS  |
| 500Mbps  |  50,000QPS  |
| 1Gbps    | 100,000QPS |
| 2Gbps    | 200,000QPS |

>
>- The application traffic limit applies to both the inbound anti-DDoS forwarding traffic and the outbound Anti-DDoS traffic. The application bandwidth needs to be higher than the peak bandwidth of the two, whichever is greater. If the actual application bandwidth is continuously higher than the **Application Bandwidth** selected when you purchased your Anti-DDoS Advanced instance, packet loss may occur. This might affect your service. We recommend adjusting your application bandwidth to avoid such occurrences.
>- QPS measures the number of normal application requests per second when there are no attacks. If this number is larger than the application bandwidth you selected when you purchased your Anti-DDoS Advanced instance, we recommend that you increase the HTTP/HTTPS QPS limit promptly to avoid affecting your business due to packet loss. To adjust the application bandwidth, refer to the table above.

## Billing Examples
The following example describes how an Anti-DDoS Advanced instance is billed using the combo billing mode.
Suppose a user purchases an Anti-DDoS Advanced instance in the Singapore region for 20 Gbps base protection bandwidth and 50 Gbps elastic protection bandwidth.
Suppose DDoS attacks occur with a peak attack bandwidth of 40 Gbps, which exceeds the base protection bandwidth and triggers elastic protection. The peak attack bandwidth falls into the billing tier between 40 Gbps and 50 Gbps. The elastic protection fee generated that day will be 800 USD.
The user will need to pay a total of 6,350 USD, of which 4,800 USD will be the monthly base protection fee, 750 USD will be the monthly fee for 50 Mbps application bandwidth, and 800 USD will be the elastic protection fee generated that day.
