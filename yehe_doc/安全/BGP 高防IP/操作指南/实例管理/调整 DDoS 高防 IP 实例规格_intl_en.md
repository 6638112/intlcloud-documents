## Operation Scenarios
When using Anti-DDoS Advanced, if you find that the current specification (such as the base protection bandwidth, number of forwarding rules, or service bandwidth) cannot meet your actual business needs, you can upgrade the Anti-DDoS Advanced instance specification to improve the protection capabilities.
Specification adjustment in Anti-DDoS Advanced supports increasing the base protection bandwidth, the number of forwarding rules (protected domain names or ports), and the service bandwidth.
>Currently, specification downgrade of purchased Anti-DDoS Advanced instances is not supported.

Upgrading Anti-DDoS Advanced instance specification incurs additional fees. After the payment is made, the instance specification upgrade will take effect immediately.
