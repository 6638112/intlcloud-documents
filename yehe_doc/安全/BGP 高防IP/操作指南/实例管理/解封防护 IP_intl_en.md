Anti-DDoS Advanced allows you to unblock blocked IPs in a self-service manner in the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/bgp_v2).

## Chances for Self-Service Unblocking

Only **three** chances of self-service unblocking are provided for Anti-DDoS Advanced every day. The system resets the chance counter daily at midnight. Unused chances cannot be accumulated for the next day.

>
>- The unblocking may fail for risk management reasons. A failed attempt does not count as a chance. Please wait for a while and then try again.
>- Before unblocking the IP, please check the predicted unblocking time which may be affected by some factors and will be postponed. If you accept the predicted time, you do not need to operate manually.
>- If the chances are used up for the day, you can upgrade the base protection capability or the elastic protection capability to defend against high-traffic attack and avoid continuous blocking.

## Directions to Self-Service Unblocking

Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/bgp_v2), select **Self-Service Unblocking** > **Unblock Blocked IP**, find the protected IP you want to unblock, and click **Unblock** in the **Operation** column. Click **OK** in the **Unblock Blocked IP** dialog box.

- If the unblocking fails, you will receive a failure message. Please wait for a while and then try again.
- If you receive a notification indicating successful unblocking, the IP has been successfully unblocked. You can refresh the page to check whether the protected IP is in running status.
