Anti-DDoS Pro allows you to unblock blocked IPs in a self-service manner in the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/unblock/list).

## Chances for Self-Service Unblocking

Only **three** chances of self-service unblocking are provided for Anti-DDoS Pro every day. The system resets the chance counter daily at midnight. Unused chances cannot be accumulated for the next day.

>?
>- Before unblocking the IP, please check the predicted unblocking time which may be affected by some factors and will be postponed. If you accept the predicted time, you do not need to operate manually.
>- If the chances are used up for the day, you can increase the protection IPs or the protection chances to defend against high-traffic attack and avoid continuous blocking.

## Directions of Self-Service Unblocking

1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/unblock/list), select **Self-Service Unblocking** > **Unblock Blocked IP** on the left sidebar to get to unblocking operation.
