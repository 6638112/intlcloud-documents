## Overview
Anti-DDoS Advanced is a paid protection service defending businesses such as games, internet services, and finance operations against high-volume distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks that may disable user access. You can configure a protected IP and then point the business IP to it or resolve the business DNS record to the assigned CNAME address for redirection. All internet traffic will first pass through the Anti-DDoS cluster. Attack traffic will be cleansed and filtered out in the Anti-DDoS cleansing center, and normal access traffic will be forwarded to the business real servers, thus ensuring business stability and availability of the real servers.

Anti-DDoS Advanced can be connected to through internet proxy and supports TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/2 protocols, making it ideal for finance, ecommerce, gaming, and other business scenarios.

## Key Features
### Multi-Dimensional protection
| Protection Type | Description |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Malformed packet filtering | Filters out frag flood, smurf, stream flood, and land flood attacks as well as malformed IP, TCP, and UDP packets |
| DDoS protection at the network layer | Filters out UDP flood, SYN flood, TCP flood, ICMP flood, ACK flood, FIN flood, RST flood, and DNS/NTP/SSDP reflection attacks and null sessions. |
| DDoS protection at the application layer | Filters out CC attacks and slow HTTP attacks and supports HTTP custom filtering such as host filtering, user-agent filtering, and referer filtering. |

### Security protection policy
Anti-DDoS Advanced provides basic security policies by default on the basis of protection algorithms such as IP profiling, behavior pattern analysis, and AI-based smart recognition, effectively coping with common DDoS attacks. It also offers flexible protection policies, which can be tailored to your actual business needs for targeted protection.

### Custom cleansing mode
Anti-DDoS Advanced supports multiple protection levels and provides a custom cleansing threshold to allow flexible adjustment based on the attack characteristics, helping you swiftly respond to various types of DDoS attacks and meet your diversified business requirements.

### Self-Service IP unblocking 
If a protected IP is blocked when the attack traffic bursts or the protection bandwidth of your Anti-DDoS Advanced instance is too low, you can unblock the IP in a self-service manner on the security protection overview page in the console.

### Protection statistics and analysis
You can access multi-dimensional statistics of DDoS attacks, CC attacks, forwarded traffic, and other metrics, which helps you stay up to date with your business and attack conditions. In addition, Anti-DDoS Advanced supports automatic capture of attack packets, helping you quickly troubleshoot exceptions and problems.
