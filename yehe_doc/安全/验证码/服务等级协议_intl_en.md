## 1. Terms and Definitions

### 1.1 Service Month(s)

Refers to the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you start the Service on March 17, the first Service Month will be from March 17 to March 31, and each calendar month thereafter (e.g., the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31) will be a Service Month. The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

### 1.2 Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month

Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month = the total number of days of the Service Month × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

### 1.3 Failed Request(s)

A request will be deemed as a Failed Request in the following cases:

(1) The return status code is 5XX or 4XX due to the Captcha system, that is, the return status code starts with 5 or 4.

(2) The normal request does not reach the Captcha server due to the failure of the Captcha system.

### 1.4 The Total Number of Requests

Refers to the total number of Captcha requests initiated by the Customer.

### 1.5 Error Rate

Error Rate shall be calculated in minutes. Error Rate = (the number of Failed Requests within one minute / the Total Number of Requests within such minute) × 100%.

### 1.6 Service Downtime

If the Error Rate of the Service is greater than 0.01% within one minute, such minute is counted as Service Downtime. If the Service is unavailable for more than one minute, it is counted as a failure event (the “Failure Event”).

### 1.7 Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes

Refers to the total number of minutes of Service Downtime in a Service Month.

## 2. Service Availability

### 2.1 Calculation of Service Availability

Service Availability = ((the total number of minutes within a Service Month - Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes in such Service Month) / the total number of minutes within a Service Month) × 100% 

### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

The Service Availability of the Service **shall be no less than 99.99% (“Service Availability Standard”)**. If the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard (except under circumstances as set forth in the Disclaimer of Liabilities), you may claim compensation in accordance with this Agreement.

### 3. Compensation Plan

In respect of the Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

### 3.1 Standards of Compensation

(1) Compensations will be made in the form of compensational service times (i.e., Captcha requests) by Tencent Cloud.

(2) Tencent Cloud will compensate you for 10 times the number of Failed Requests in the Failure Event of the Service Month, i.e., the number of compensational service times = the number of Failed Requests x 10. For example, if the number of Failed Requests in the Failure Event of a Service Month in which the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard is 10, Tencent Cloud will compensate you for 100 Captcha requests (=10 * 10).

### 3.2 Time Limit for Compensation Application

(1) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you may **apply for compensation only through the Tencent Cloud ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5th) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month. Tencent Cloud will verify and ascertain your application upon receipt of such application. If there is any dispute over the calculation of the Service Availability for a Service Month, **both parties agree that the back-end record of Tencent Cloud shall prevail**.

(2) **You shall apply for compensation within two (2) months following the end of the applicable Service Month in which the Service Availability fails to meet the Service Availability Standard.** If you fail to make any application within such period, or make the application after such period, or make the application by any means other than that agreed herein, it shall be deemed that you have voluntarily waived your right to apply for such compensation and any other rights you may have against Tencent Cloud, in which case Tencent Cloud has the right to reject your application for compensation and not to make any compensation to you.

## 4. Disclaimer of Liabilities

**If the service is unavailable due to any of the following reasons, the corresponding Service Downtime shall not be counted towards Service Unavailability period, and is not eligible for compensation by Tencent Cloud, and Tencent Cloud will not be held liable to you:**
