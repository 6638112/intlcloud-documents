You can purchase the KMS service in the following ways:
- Purchase the service on the [KMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/kms) product page at Tencent Cloud official website.
- Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and select **Products** > **Data Security** > **Key Management Service** for purchase.

>KMS can be seamlessly integrated with Tencent Cloud products such as COS, CBS, TDSQL, and CFS for encryption. You need to activate KMS first before you can use KMS-related encryption features for those products.
