You can purchase the KMS service in the following ways:

- Purchase the service on the [KMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/product/kms) overview page at Tencent Cloud official website.
- Log in to the [KMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/kms2) and purchase the service.

> !KMS can be seamlessly integrated with Tencent Cloud services such as COS, CBS, TDSQL, and CFS for encryption. You need to activate KMS first before you can use KMS-related encryption features for those services.
