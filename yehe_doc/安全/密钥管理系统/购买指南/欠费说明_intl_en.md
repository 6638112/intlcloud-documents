## Overdue Status
When your account becomes overdue, notifications for service suspension will be sent through email and SMS to your Tencent Cloud account creators and all collaborators on and after the day of expiration.

## Suspension Status
Your KMS service will be suspended 24 hours after your account becomes overdue. At this time, your access to KMS will be denied, but your key data will be retained. After the service is suspended, fees will not be incurred by key storage and API calls.

## Resource Repossession
To ensure the integrity of your sensitive data, KMS will not actively repossess your resources. After your account is topped up to a positive balance, your existing key data can be used normally.
