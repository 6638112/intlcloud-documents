Anti-DDoS Pro provides Tencent Cloud public IPs with higher anti-DDoS capability. It supports Tencent Cloud services such as CVM, CLB, NAT, and WAF and is easy to access with no IP changes required.
Currently, Anti-DDoS Pro offers two types of instances, single IP instances and multi-IP instances.
## Prerequisites
You need to purchase an Anti-DDoS Pro instance before you can bind it to the IP addresses you want to protect.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/overview) and go to **Anti-DDoS Pro** > **Resource List**.
• For single IP instances, go to the **Single IP Instance** tab.
• For multi-IP instances, go to the **Multi-IP Instance** tab.
2. Select the region of the target Anti-DDoS Pro instance and click **Bind Resource** in the "Operation" column to the right of the instance.
3. On the **Bind Resource** page, select **Resource Type** and **Resources to Associate** according to your needs.
  - A single IP instance can only be bound to one resource.
	  -If your Anti-DDoS Pro instance is a multi-IP instance, you can select multiple options for **Resource Type** and **Resources to Associate**. The number of resources cannot exceed the **number of IPs** set when the instance is purchased.
