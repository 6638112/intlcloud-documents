## Use Cases
Tencent Cloud will send you alarm messages for your IPs protected by Anti-DDoS Pro via the channels (including Message Center, SMS, email, and WeChat) you configured in [**Message Center** -> **Message Subscription**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message/subscription) when:
- An attack starts.
