If your business requires the same Anti-DDoS Pro instance to protect multiple business IPs, you can upgrade the protection to cover all the business IPs.

## Prerequisites
You need to [purchase an Anti-DDoS Pro instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/36115) and set the protected object's IP first.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [new Anti-DDoS Pro Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ddos/antiddos-native/package) and click **Anti-DDoS Pro Instance** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Upgrade** in the "Operation" column on the right of the target Anti-DDoS Pro instance.
3. On the upgrade page, select the "number of IPs" and "protected times" as needed.
  - Number of IPs: upgrade the number of IPs to be protected by the Anti-DDoS Pro instance.
  - Protected Times: upgrade the number of protections per month in the Anti-DDoS Pro instance.
