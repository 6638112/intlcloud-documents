Anti-DDoS Pro supports configuring custom blocking policies against specific IP, TCP, UDP message header or load. After enabling feature filtering, you can combine the matching conditions of the source port, destination port, message length, IP message header or load, and set the protection action to allow/block/discard matched requests, block the IP for 15 minutes, discard the request and block the IP for 15 minutes, or continue protection, etc. With feature filtering, you can configure precise protection policies against business message features or attack message features.
