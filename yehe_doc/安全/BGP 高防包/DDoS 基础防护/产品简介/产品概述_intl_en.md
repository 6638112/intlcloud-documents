## Overview

With Tencent Cloud Anti-DDoS Basic, you can enjoy free 2 Gbps basic DDoS protection capability for resources such as Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) and Cloud Load Balancer (CLB) to meet your daily security protection needs. Tencent Cloud will dynamically adjust the blocking threshold based on your security reputation score that is subject to historical attacks and cloud resource details. If your score is too low, you may not use the free protection capability until your security reputation is restored. Anti-DDoS Basic is enabled by default to monitor network traffic in real time and cleanse attack traffic as soon as it is detected, with protection for Tencent Cloud public IPs started within seconds.
>?If you need higher DDoS protection capability for your daily operations, select a desired [Anti-DDoS Pro service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1029/36107).
