## Scenarios

When you receive a DDoS attack alarm message or notice any issue with your business, you need to view the attack details including the attack traffic and current protection effect. Enough information is critical for you to take measures to keep your business running smoothly.
The Anti-DDoS Basic console allows you to stay on top of attack details with statistical reports.

## Directions

1. Log in to [Anti-DDoS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/overview).
2. On the **Anti-DDoS Basic ** page, select a server type and a region, and then click the server name.
3. On the **DDoS Attacks** tab, set a query period.
  - In the **Attack Traffic Statistics** section, you can view the DDoS attack trend within the set period.
  - In the **DDoS Attack Records** section, you can view the DDoS attack records including the start and end time of the attack, whether blocking is triggered and the cleansed traffic volume.
