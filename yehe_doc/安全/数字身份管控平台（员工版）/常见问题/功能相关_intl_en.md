### What deployment modes does EIAM support?
EIAM supports two deployment modes: public cloud deployment and on-premises deployment.

### What are the differences between on-premises EIAM and SaaS EIAM?
The on-premises edition has more comprehensive capabilities than the SaaS edition.
The on-premises edition supports richer account management rules (e.g., account lifecycle management and automated task) as well as access control rules (e.g., attribute-based access control model). It can dynamically control access permissions according to the visitor's context information. In addition, it can be deeply customized.
Therefore, the on-premises edition is more suitable for large enterprises and government agencies that have many employees and complex applications deployed on premises. The SaaS edition is suitable for enterprises that fully embrace the public cloud with most of their business applications in the form of SaaS.

### What are the differences between EIAM and CIAM?
- Enterprise Identity Access Management (EIAM) is oriented to enterprise internal management and helps enterprises manage employee accounts, assign application permissions, and configure identity verification methods for application access. It focuses on full-lifecycle employee account management and fine-grained permission management and supports complicated organizational structures, flexible access control rules, and diverse permission models.
- Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) is oriented to internet users and helps developers quickly implement know-your-customer (KYC), sync discrete user data, and better profile users, so as to quickly identify users from any channels (app, PC browser, and phone).
CIAM focuses on better access experience and supports passwordless authentication, cross-platform integration, risk management (with malicious user identification), and compliance management.

### What is the relationship between EIAM and zero trust?
- Zero trust is a security concept with the idea of "never trust, always verify". The zero trust mechanism assumes that any subjects (users/devices/applications) inside or outside the network perimeter are untrustworthy before being authenticated. As a result, dynamic access trust needs to be established based on continuous verification and authorization. The essence is to perform identity-centric access control.
- EIAM is the core and cornerstone for enterprises to build a zero trust system.
