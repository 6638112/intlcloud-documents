EIAM can manage application accounts, permissions, and identity verification methods in a unified manner. In this way, admins can effectively manage the lifecycle of employee accounts to avoid data security incidents due to improper authorization and fully meet the requirements of regulatory compliance.

## Zero Trust Enterprise System Transformation
Central configuration of employee accounts and application access control policies is indispensable to implementing zero trust systems. EIAM supports seamless integration with Tencent Security's terminal and network security products and thus helps you upgrade your systems to zero trust.
