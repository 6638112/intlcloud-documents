Employee Identity and Access Management (EIAM) is used to manage the accounts, permissions, authentication rules, and application access control rules for employees.

Traditional enterprise IT adopts the chimney construction method, which is generally faced by the following challenges:
- Each system has an independent account system, and employees need to remember multiple sets of accounts and passwords.
- Coarse-grained management of application authorizations can easily lead to data leakage.
- The security of identity authentication is questionable, and sensitive systems don't have strict authentication mechanisms.

EIAM provides a set of centralized account, permission, authentication, and auditing tools to help you break through the silos of identity data. It enables end users to access multiple applications upon one authentication of one single account. This improves the efficiency of organizational management and reduces the costs incurred by repeated credential creations while strengthening the enterprise security system.

EIAM supports both SaaS and on-premises deployment modes:
- SaaS EIAM is suitable for users who fully embrace public cloud services with most of their business applications in the form of SaaS.
- On-premises EIAM is suitable for users who have not fully embraced public cloud services with most of their business applications deployed on premises and users who need more customizations.
