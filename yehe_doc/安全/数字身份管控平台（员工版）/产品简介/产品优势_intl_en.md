## Multi-Protocol Support
EIAM supports diverse authentication and authorization protocols such as OAuth, SAML, OIDC, and JWT, so you can quickly integrate multiple applications. This enables end users to access multiple applications upon one authentication, which improves the user access efficiency and experience.

## Flexible Access Control Rules
EIAM supports both the role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models. It implements access control rule orchestration according to the context of user access, such as environment, device, and behavior information.

## Effective Risk Audit
EIAM can identify unverified, inactive, and duplicate accounts as well as unreasonable authorization rules to avoid risks of information leakage due to improper account management and authorization processes.

## Regulatory Compliance
EIAM allows you to configure MFA, manage authorization rules, and remove expired accounts from your business systems, which help you better meet applicable compliance requirements and pass compliance assessments, including Cybersecurity Classified Protection 2.0.

## High Stability and Availability
EIAM supports horizontal scaling and runs stably even when the number of employees reaches one million, which has been proven in multiple large projects, such as Digital Guangdong and China Central Television (CCTV).

## Multiple Deployment Modes
EIAM supports deployment and delivery in both public and private clouds as needed to help you uniformly manage digital user identities in applications. This effectively reduces development costs and improves the security.
