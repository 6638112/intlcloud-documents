## Overview
With data provided by the bot traffic management module, bot traffic analysis quickly analyzes the bot impacts on domain names in terms of bot feature metrics, including the types of bots, proportion of actions, bot score distribution, top data by request count and URLs that may be affected. You can click **View details** to view the bot details of an access source, and its access characteristics and exceptions detected.

The bot traffic details section displays the bot traffic details of top 10 access sources. You can also view their session access information and logs if session settings are configured, and the information of these access sources/IPs by retrieval.


## Prerequisites
You have subscribed to the [bot traffic management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/627/47799) service and enabled bot traffic analysis.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [WAF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/guanjia/tea-flowanalysis) and select **Bot Traffic Analysis** on the left sidebar. Open the **Bot traffic details** tab.
2. On the page displayed, click the drop-down list in the upper-left corner and select a domain name.
3. Specify a date or use the filter to search top 10 access sources of all domain names or a specific domain name. Then click **View logs** of the access source you want to view.

### Viewing access overview
The bot traffic details page shows you the estimated risk value of the access source and the information of the hit policy, and allows you to take measures such as adding the access source to the allowlist/blocklist and creating custom rules targeting the access source.

**Field description:**
 - IP address and tag: It displays the IP address of an access source and the hit tag that identifies the bot category.
 - Last request: It displays the score of the last access request from the access source and the risk level.
 - Session count: It displays the number of continuous sessions on the website accessed occurred in the last access request.
 - Access address: It displays the domain name of the access source.
 - Exception feature: It displays modules that detect exceptional features of the access source.
 - Hit modules: It displays modules that take actions to combat bots.
 - Policy ID: It is the ID of a hit policy.

### Viewing bot scores
In the bot score distribution and bot action distribution sections, you can view the distribution of bot scores and bot actions within the selected period, helping you determine the risk level of the access source.

### Viewing bot information
The bot traffic details page also displays information of the automated access source including the features of the bot and access request, threat intelligence and AI evaluation information, bot flow statistics and sessions. Using this data, you can quickly identify exceptions in the access request and take measures against the bot.
