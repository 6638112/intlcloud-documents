## Feature Overview
The bot behavior management feature of WAF can differentiate between friendly and malicious bots and crawlers and implement corresponding management policies such as letting through the traffic of search engine bots, blocking the traffic of malicious item information crawlers, delaying responses, or adopting different response time periods. This feature reduces resource consumption, information leakage, and failed marketing caused by malicious bots and crawlers on the one hand and ensures normal operations of friendly ones (such as search engine bots and advertising programs) on the other hand.
On the bot overview page, you can quickly get to know the information of bots for the top 5â€“10 domain names, view the bot type, action, and request trend through thumbnails, and stay up to date with the access proportion and trend of bots for each domain name.
