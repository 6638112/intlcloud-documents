- Supports cross-region deployment of cluster protection resources, dynamic scaling, and on-demand usage to avoid redundancy and single points of failure.

## Protection from AI Engine and Rule Engine
- The security rule engine protects your business against the OWASP top 10 attacks, including SQL injection, unauthorized access, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and command line injection. WAF is also powered with AI defense capabilities to enable continuous learning through cross-validation and accurately and effectively capture common web attacks, zero-day attacks, and other new unknown attacks.
- WAF continuously learns the characteristics of massive business data to generate business-oriented personalized protection policies and avoid false positives. You can use the AI engine to handle false positives and false negatives to improve operation efficiency.
