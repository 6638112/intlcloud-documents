>- If a wildcard domain name, such as `*.test.com`, is already connected to Tencent Cloud, then any of its sub-domain names cannot be connected to another account.
>- If the wildcard domain name `*.test.com` is already connected to your account, then wildcard domain names in formats such as `*.a.test.com` cannot be connected to this account.

### How long does it take to update the DNS resolution (protection) status of my domain name?
Verify that CNAME configuration for your website domain name is correct. Once you add a CNAME record in DNS, wait 10-20 minutes for the protection status to be updated. If you have waited over 30 minutes, and the protection status has not been updated yet, you can contact us for help by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=141&level2_id=642&source=0&data_title=T-Sec-Web%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E9%98%B2%E7%81%AB%E5%A2%99&level3_id=867&radio_title=%E6%8E%A7%E5%88%B6%E5%8F%B0%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98&queue=15&scene_code=29995&step=2).

### Will WAF notify me when the intermediate IP address of my domain name is changed?
In principle, the intermediate IP address of your domain name is not changed. If it happens, we will notify you by SMS, email or Message Center. You can view your intermediate IP address in the [Domain Name List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/guanjia/tea-domain) of the console.

You can view the specific value in the instance information in the [domain name list in the WAF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/guanjia/tea-domain).
