To enjoy continuous security services, you can manually renew your WAF instance before it expires or set auto-renewal for it.

## Renewal Reminder

From seven days before your WAF service expires, the system will send expiration and renewal alerts to your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via Message Center, SMS, and email. For alert settings, see Payment Overdue.

If you enable auto-renewal when purchasing a WAF instance, the system will automatically renew the instance upon expiration with your account balance.
