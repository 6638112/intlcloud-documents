>- If you cannot access the service, you will need to activate the service/check the billing information (for root account) or request the corresponding permission from the admin or root account (for sub-account/collaborator).

## Step 1. Configure a policy (optional)

We recommend you configure a recognition policy based on your business needs for a personalized user experience.

>?
>- You can skip this step if you use the preset default policy of Tencent Cloud CMS.

## Step 4. Create an AMS task

After completing the above steps, you can call the **CreateAudioModerationTask** API to create an audio stream recognition task as instructed below:

- Make sure that the audio meets the [file format requirements](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46101#1.-.E6.8E.A5.E5.8F.A3.E6.8F.8F.E8.BF.B0) of the API.
- Enter the input parameters as instructed in the [API documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46101#2.-.E8.BE.93.E5.85.A5.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0).
- If the task is created successfully, you can use the task query API to query task details, and you can refer to the [example of creating audio moderation task](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46101#.E7.A4.BA.E4.BE.8B1-.E5.88.9B.E5.BB.BA.E9.9F.B3.E9.A2.91.E5.AE.A1.E6.A0.B8.E4.BB.BB.E5.8A.A1) for more information on sample response parameters. If task creation fails, the API will return an error code, and you can refer to [Business Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46101#6.-.E9.94.99.E8.AF.AF.E7.A0.81) and [Common Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46099#.E5.85.AC.E5.85.B1.E9.94.99.E8.AF.AF.E7.A0.81) for troubleshooting.

>? When connecting to the service, you can use API Explorer for online debugging.

## Step 5. Get the AMS task result

After creating the audio recognition task, you can call the **DescribeTaskDetail** API to query the details of the task as instructed below:

- Enter the input parameters as instructed in the [API documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46100).
- If the API call is successful, you will receive the response output from the API, including the task details. You can refer to the [example of viewing task details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1139/46100#4.-.E7.A4.BA.E4.BE.8B) for more information on sample response parameters.
