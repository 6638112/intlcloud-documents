### Can I modify the default QPS (queries per second)?

If you have such needs, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance with modification on the backend.

### Is QPS for the account dimension or `Biztype` dimension?

QPS is for the account dimension and is 1,000 by default, which is shared by all `Biztype` values.

### Can I customize the `Biztype` field of API 4.0?

Yes, but you need to [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for generation on the backend. `Biztype` can contain 3â€“32 letters, digits, and underscores. You should inform us of the configuration format in advance, as the format cannot be changed once configured.

### Will the `Review` field of API 4.0 be output for each tag?

It will be output for only tags with a score output by auto review but not for such tags as ad and QR code.

### Can I add types of malicious content by myself?

No.
