## Challenges in Content Moderation

With the rapid development of the internet, smart devices, and various emerging businesses, internet data has been growing explosively and is subject to diverse uncontrollable risks, such as pornographic text, terrorism content, and spam ads.

With ever heightened regulation, content involving violence, blood, porn, gambling, and drug use has become an area of focus, which makes content moderation an urgent need of short video, news, and live streaming platforms.

As common violent, ironic, and suggestive content in text are difficult and costly to recognize and moderate through traditional means, enterprises face new technical challenges in content operations.
