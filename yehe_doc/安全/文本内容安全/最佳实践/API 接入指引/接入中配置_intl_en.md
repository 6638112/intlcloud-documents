## Online Debugging with API Explorer

Tencent Cloud API Explorer is an automated tool suitable for interactive UIs. It is easy to use with no additional configuration required but not suitable for repeated and continuous use.

This tool provides various capabilities such as online call, signature verification, SDK demo generation, and quick API search, greatly improving the efficiency of using TencentCloud API. You can use it to debug TMS parameters online as instructed in **Request Structure**.

## API Connection Through SDK

To improve your connection experience and reduce your connection costs, we recommend you use the companion SDK 3.0, a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. It unifies parameter calls and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.

We recommend you connect to TMS through the SDK. The following are the SDK connection guides for different programming languages:
