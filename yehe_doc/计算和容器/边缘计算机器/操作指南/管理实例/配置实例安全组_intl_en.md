## Overview

A security group is a virtual firewall that can filter stateful data packets. As an important means for network security isolation provided by Tencent Cloud, it can be used to set network access controls for one or more ECM instances.
When creating an ECM instance, you must configure a security group for it. If the module's security group that your created instance uses by default or the custom security group cannot meet the requirements of your business scenarios, you can replace it as instructed in this document.



## Directions
1. Log in to the [ECM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ecm/overview).
2. On the left sidebar, select **[Instance List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ecm/instance)** to enter the **Instance List** page.
3. On the **Instance List** page, find the target instance and select **More** > **Configure Security Group** on the right of the row as shown below:
