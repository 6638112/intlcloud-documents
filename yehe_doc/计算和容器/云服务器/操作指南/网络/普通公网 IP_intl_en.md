## Overview
This document describes how to use the common public IP address. The common public IP can only be assigned when it is purchased in the CVM and cannot be unbound from the CVM. The unassigned public IPs are unavailable.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- When the bill-by-CVM accounts unbind IPs, each account can re-assign the public IP 10 times per day for free.
- Only BGP IPs are applicable for the current common public IP addresses.
