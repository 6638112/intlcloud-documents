## Overview
A cloud disk is an expandable storage device on cloud. You can expand its capacity at any time without losing any data in it.
After expanding the cloud disk, you need to expand the partition and file system. You can allocate the capacity of the expanded part to an existing partition or format it into a new partition.


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
MBR partition supports disk with a maximum capacity of 2 TB. When you partition disk with a capacity greater than 2 TB, we recommend that you create and mount a new data disk and use the GPT partition format to copy data.
</dx-alert>


## Expanding Data Disks
If the cloud disk is a data disk, you can expand it using the following three methods.


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
If multiple cloud disks of the same capacity and type are attached to the CVM, you can identify them using the method shown in [Distinguishing data disks](#distinguish). Select a data disk and expand its capacity as instructed below.

6. Assign its expanded capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition. Depending on the operating system of the CVM, see [Extending Partitions and File Systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) or [Determining the Expansion Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995).

::: CBS console[](id:useCBSConsole)
1. Log in to the [CBS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cbs).
2. Select **More** > **Expand** for the target cloud disk.
3. Select a new capacity. It must be greater than or equal to the current capacity.
4. Complete the payment.
5. Assign its expanded capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition. Depending on the operating system of the CVM, see [Extending Partitions and File Systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) or [Determining the Expansion Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995).
:::
::: API[](id:useAPI)
You can use the `ResizeDisk` API to expand the specified cloud disks. For more information, see [ResizeDisk](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/16310).

## Expanding System Disks[](id:useCVMconsole)
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index). Locate the target CVM, and select **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Expand System Disk** in the **Operation** column.
2. Select the system disk to be expanded in the pop-up window, and click **Next**.
3. Select a new capacity (it must be greater than or equal to the current capacity) and click **Next**.
4. Complete the capacity expansion operation in the following methods:
<dx-tabs>
::: Offline expansion
1. Read the notes, select **Agree to a forced shutdown**, and click **Adjust Now**, as shown below:
<img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b3702c6323dfd650665a1293db56b295.png"/>
2. After the expansion is completed on the console, check the cloudinit configuration for [Linux instances](#confirmLinuxConfig) or [Windows instances](#confirmwindowsConfig) according to the operating system of the CVM. Then expand partitions and file systems as needed.

::: Online expansion
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
CVM supports online capacity expansion for cloud disk serving as system disk, i.e., non-stop capacity expansion. To use this feature, [submit a ticket](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/workorder) for application.
</dx-alert>
  1. Read the notes and click **Adjust Now**.
 2. After the capacity expansion operation is completed in the console, log in to the instance to check whether the file system has been automatically expanded.

### Checking the cloudinit configuration
Check cloud disks according to the operating system of the CVM.
<dx-tabs>
::: Linux instances[](id:confirmLinuxConfig)
After the system disk is expanded, [log in to the Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436) and check whether the `/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg` file contains the `growpart` and `resizefs` configuration items.
 - If yes, ignore other operations.
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/03d38f34651d317176c50f1ed3a03f30.png)
    - **growpart**: expands the partition to the disk size.
    - **resizefs**: expands or adjusts the file system in the `/` partition to the partition size.
 - If no, manually [extend partitions and file systems (Linux)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/39995) according to the operating system, and assign its extended capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition.
:::
::: Windows instances[](id:confirmwindowsConfig)
After the system disk is expanded, [log in to the Windows instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/213/5435) and check whether the `ExtendVolumesPlugin` configuration item exists in the `plugin` under `C:\Program Files\Cloudbase Solutions\Cloudbase-Init\conf\cloudbase-init.conf`.
 - If yes, ignore other operations.
 - If no, manually [extend partitions and file systems (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31601) according to the operating system, and assign its extended capacity to an existing partition, or format it into an independent new partition.
