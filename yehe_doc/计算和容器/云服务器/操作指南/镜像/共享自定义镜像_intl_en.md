## Overview

**Shared image** means that you share with **others users** a [**custom image**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942) you have created. You can also obtain images shared by other users, get the necessary components, and add custom contents.

>! Tencent Cloud does not guarantee the integrity or security of shared images. Please only use shared images from reliable sources.
>

## Notes
 - Each image can be shared with a maximum of 50 Tencent Cloud users.
 - The name and description of shared images cannot be changed. They are used to create CVM instances only.
 - Images shared with other users do not occupy your own image quota.
 - A custom image that has been shared with others can be deleted, provided that you first cancel image sharing. For more information, see [Cancelling Image Sharing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/7148). The shared images that you obtain from others cannot be deleted.
 - Custom images can only be shared with accounts in the same region as the source account. To share an image with users in another region, you need to copy it to the target region before sharing.
 - The shared images that you obtain from others cannot be shared with the third users.
