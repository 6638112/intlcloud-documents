## Overview
Besides public images and marketplace images (only available in the Chinese mainland), you can also create custom images, with which you can create CVM instances with the same configurations.


<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Images use the CBS snapshot service for data storage:
 - A free tier of 50 GB is provided in the Chinese mainland regions. For more information, please see [Free Tier](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/32415).
 - Upon the creation of a custom image, a snapshot is automatically created and associated with the image. As a result, retaining custom images incurs costs. For more information, please see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/32415).
</dx-alert>




## Notes

- Each region supports a maximum of 10 custom images.
- The following directories and files will be cleared.
 - `/var/log/`  
 - `/root/.bash_history` and `/home/ubuntu/.bash_history` (for the Ubuntu operating system)
- When creating a custom image by using a Linux instance, make sure that `/etc/fstab` does not contain data disk configuration. Otherwise, instances created with this image cannot be launched normally. If the Linux instance is mounted with a data disk, comment out or delete the relevant data disk configurations in `/etc/fstab`.
- The creation process takes ten minutes or longer, which depends on the data size of the instance. Please prepare in advance to avoid business impacts.
- You can not create an image by using a CPM 2.0 instance in the console or via API. You can use CVM to create them.
- If your Windows instance needs to enter a domain and uses a domain account, please execute Sysprep before creating a custom image to ensure that the SID is unique after the instance enters the domain. For more information, please see [Ensuring Unique SIDs for CVMs Using Sysprep](https://intl.cloud.Tencent.com/document/product/213/35876).

## Directions
<dx-tabs>
::: Creating a custom image from an instance in the console

#### Shut down an instance (optional)
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) and check whether the corresponding instance needs to be shut down.
<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
For CVMs created based on public images after July 2018, you can create images without shutting down the instance. For other CVMs, shut down the instance before creating a custom image to ensure that the image has the same environment deployment as the current instance.
</dx-alert>
  - If the instance needs to be shut down, proceed to the next step.
  - If the instance doesnâ€™t need to be shut down, please proceed to [Create a custom image](#createOS).
2. On the instance management page, proceed according to the actually used view mode:
  - **List view**: in the row of the target instance, select **More** > **Instance Status** > **Shut down** on the right as shown below:
![Shut down](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/cc0bb1c82b96cca94cb7c1c011b664a7.png)
  - **Tab view**: in the row of the target instance, select **More** > **Instance Status** > **Shut down** on the right as shown below:

#### Create a custom image [](id:createOS)
1. On the instance management page, proceed according to the actually used view mode:
   - **List view**: select **More** > **Create Image** as shown below:
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8e3fc28e1a0b1e9e337ff72e34a9fd01.png)
   - **Tab view**: select **More Actions** > **Create Image** in the top-right corner as shown below:
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/039016d43e55b014da4b13e2e7408f43.png)
2. In the **Create a custom image** popup window, complete the configuration.
  - **Image name** and **Image description**: Custom name and description.
  - **Create a system disk image only * *: If checked, only a system disk image of the instance will be created. If unchecked, a data disk snapshot will be created at the same time when the instance has a data disk mounted.
3. Click **Create image**.
You can click **[Image](https://console.cloud.Tencent.com/CVM/image)** on the left sidebar to view the creation progress in the **Image** page.


#### Use the custom image to create an instance (optional)
Select the image you created in the image list, and click **Create Instance** on the right side to purchase a server with the same configuration as the image, as shown in the following figure:

## Best Practices

### Migrating the data on a data disk

If you need to keep the data on the data disk of the original instance when launching a new instance, you can first take a [snapshot](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31638) of the data disk, and then use this data disk snapshot to create a new CBS data disk.
For more information, please see [Creating Cloud Disks Using Snapshots](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/5757).
