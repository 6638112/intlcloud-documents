## Overview

This document describes how to create a CVM instance by using the custom configuration mode as an example.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a CVM instance, you need to complete the following steps:
- [Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985).
- [Create a VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805) in the target region and [create a subnet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31806) in the target availability zone under the VPC.
- (Optional) [Create a project](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/378/34726).
- (Optional) [Create a security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34271) in the target region and add a security group rule that meets your business requirements.
- (Optional) [Create an SSH key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16691) under the target project for a Linux instance.
- (Optional) [Create a custom image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942) or [import an image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4945).

## Directions

1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/), select **Products** > **Compute and Container** > **[Cloud Virtual Machine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/products/cvm)**, and click **Get Started** to enter the CVM purchase page.

Packet loss will occur when the bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where the network connection fluctuates slightly.</li><li><b>Bill-by-traffic</b>: Billing is based on traffic that is actually used. You can specify a bandwidth cap to prevent charges incurred by unexpected traffic. Packet loss will occur when the instantaneous bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where the network connection fluctuates significantly.</li><li><b>Bandwidth package</b>: Select this aggregated billing when your public network instances have traffic peaks at different times. This is applicable to large-scale businesses where traffic can be staggered between different instances using the public network.<br>Bandwidth packages are in beta test now. <a href="https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">Join the beta</a></li></ul><b>Note</b>: <ul><li>The assigned public IP cannot be unbound from the instance directly.
