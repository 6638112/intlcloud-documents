## Introduction
Project is a Tencent Cloud feature used to manage cloud resources. When you create a CVM instance, you must assign it to a project. You can change the instance project afterwards if you want to.

> You need to create at least one project before you can assign an instance to a project. For more information on how to create a project, refer to [New Project](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/34726).
