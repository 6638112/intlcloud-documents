The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock synchronization between computer systems over a network. NTP servers usually use Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Tencent Cloud provides a private NTP server for Tencent Cloud resources. For other devices, you can use the public NTP servers provided by Tencent Cloud.
