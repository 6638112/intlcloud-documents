Compared with using quick configuration to create a Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM), custom configuration provides more image platforms and advanced configurations for storage, bandwidth, and security group. You can select the configuration method as needed. This document uses custom configuration as an example.

## Registration and Verification

Before using a CVM instance, you need to perform the following operations:
1. Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account and complete identity verification.
A new user needs to [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) for an account on the Tencent Cloud website. For details, see [Signing up for a Tencent Cloud Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985).
2. Go to the [Tencent Cloud CVM introduction page](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/products/cvm) page and click **Buy Now**.


## Selecting Model[](id:SelectType)

2. Click **Next: Confirm Configuration** to enter the configuration information confirmation page.


## Confirming Configuration Information

1. Validate the information of the CVM instance to be purchased and the cost details of each configuration item.
2. Read and select **Agree "Tencent Cloud Service Terms"**.
3. You can perform the following operations as needed:
   - Select **Save as Launch Template** to save the configuration of this instance as a launch template, based on which you can quickly create instances. For more information, see [Managing Instance Startup Template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/45221).
   - Select **Generate API Explorer Reusable Script** to generate the OpenAPI reusable script code for instance creation corresponding to the selected configuration. You can save the code for purchasing CVM instances with the same configuration. For more information, see [Generating API Explorer Reusable Scripts to Create Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/39811).
4. Click **Buy Now** or **Activate** and complete the payment. You can then check your CVM instances in the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm).
Information such as the instance name, public IP address, private IP address, login username, and initial login password of the CVM instance will be sent to your account through the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message). You can use this information to log in to and manage your instances. To ensure the security of your CVM instance, change your CVM instance login password as soon as possible.

## Logging in and Connecting to Instance

After completing CVM operations, you can log in to your CVM instance in the Tencent Cloud console and perform operations such as building a site as needed.
Select a method for logging in to the CVM instance in the Tencent Cloud console as needed:
- [Logging in to Linux Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436)
- [Logging in to Linux Instances (Remote Login)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502)
- [Logging in to Linux Instance (SSH Key)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501)

## Partitioning and formatting the data disk

If you added a data disk when [selecting the instance type](#SelectType), you need to format and partition the data disk after logging in to the CVM instance. **If you have not added any data disks, skip this step.**
Select the appropriate operations guide according to the disk capacity and the CVM operating system.
- For a disk smaller than 2 TB:
 [Initializing a Cloud Disk (Linux)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31597)
- For a disk equal to or larger than 2 TB:
 [Initializing a Cloud Disk (Linux)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31598)

For more operations, see [Initialization Scenarios](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31596).
