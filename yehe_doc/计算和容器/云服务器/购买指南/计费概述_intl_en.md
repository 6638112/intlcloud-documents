## Billing Plans

Tencent Cloud offers two ways to purchase a CVM instance: pay as you go and spot instance. For more information, see [Instance Billing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).
CVM supports the reserved instance (RI) billing. 

## Instances

The instance type determines the hardware configuration of its host. Every instance type has different computing and storage capacities. You can choose the computing capacity, storage space, and network access method for the instances that best suits your service scale.
Tencent Cloud provides various models with different hardware specifications. For details, please see [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518).

For more information about instance prices, see [Instance Billing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).

## Storage

Tencent Cloud provides a wide range of flexible, cost-effective and user-friendly data storage devices for CVM instances. Each storage device has a unique price and performance characteristics, making them suitable for different use cases. They can be categorized as follows:

- Use case: system disk and data disk
- Architecture: cloud disk, local disk and Cloud Object Storage

Tencent Cloud now provides two types of cloud disks, including Premium Cloud Storage and SSD. There are two billing options: monthly subscription and pay as you go.

## Network Bandwidth

Tencent Cloud provides high-quality multi-line BGP networks for ISPs to ensure optimal network experience. There are two billing options: bill-by-traffic and bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-bandwidth: billed based on the public network transmission rate (in Mbps). When your bandwidth utilization is higher than 10%, we recommend bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-traffic: it is billed based on the total amount of data transmission (in GB). When your bandwidth utilization is less than 10%, we recommend bill-by-traffic.
