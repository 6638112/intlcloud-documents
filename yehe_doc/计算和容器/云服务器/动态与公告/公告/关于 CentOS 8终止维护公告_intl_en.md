CentOS has officially discontinued support for CentOS 8 since January 1, 2022, and plans to discontinue support for CentOS 7 on June 30, 2024. For more information, see [CentOS's official announcement](https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/?spm=a2c4g.11174386.n2.3.348f4c07hk46v4).

## Notes
Tencent Cloud will not discontinue CentOS 8 images, but will stop updating CentOS 8 images and OS software versions. To avoid impact on your business, Tencent Cloud provides a number of image tags for you to choose from:
- [TencentOS Server](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/40223)
- [OpenCloudOS Server](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/46209)
- CentOS Stream and other released versions such as Ubuntu

If you are using CentOS, you are advised to migrate to the corresponding TencentOS version as soon as possible. For the detailed migration directions, see [Migrating CentOS to TencentOS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/46962).
