OpenCloudOS, an open source operating system community jointly initiated by Tencent and its partners, is a completely neutral, fully open, secure, stable and high-performance operating system and ecosystem. OpenCloudOS accumulates the advantages of many vendors in software and open source ecosystem and inherits Tencent's over 10 years of technical accumulation in the operating system and kernel fields. It has solid support in terms of cloud nativeness, stability, performance, and hardware support, and can support all hardware platforms equally and comprehensively.

OpenCloudOS 8.5 is the first official release of the OpenCloudOS community. Its basic libraries and user-mode components are fully compatible with CentOS 8, and through kernel level optimization and enhancement, OpenCloudOS 8.5 provides users with better solutions than CentOS 8.

## Use Cases
OpenCloudOS works with the vast majority of production instances on the cloud, including Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) and Cloud Physical Server (CPS) 2.0.
