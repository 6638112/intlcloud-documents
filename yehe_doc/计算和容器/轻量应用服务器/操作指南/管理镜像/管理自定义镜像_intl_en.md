## Overview
You can create a custom image in addition to using Lighthouse application images and system images. The custom image can be used to quickly create Lighthouse instances with the same configurations as the image in the Lighthouse console.

## Notes
- Up to 20 custom images can be created in each region.
- A free tire of five custom images is provided in each region, and excessive images will incur fees. For more information, see [ Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1103/41403).
- If your account has overdue payments:
 - The custom image feature will be disabled, and you cannot create more custom images.
 - All custom images (including those within the free tier) under your account will be isolated in the **to be repossessed** status and become unavailable. If you don't top up your account within seven days, the custom images will be automatically released.
- The creation process takes ten minutes or more, which depends on the data size of the instance. Prepare in advance to avoid business impacts.
- Currently, cross-region replication of custom images is not supported. You can regularly check out the [TencentCloud Lighthouse](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/products/lighthouse) page to get the latest information.
