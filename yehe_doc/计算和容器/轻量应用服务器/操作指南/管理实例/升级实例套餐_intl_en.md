## Overview
This document guides you through the process of upgrading a Tencent Cloud Lighthouse instance.


## Limits
- Lighthouse instances can only be upgraded, but not downgraded. It means that the new specification (including the CPU, MEM, SSD system disk size, bandwidth/bandwidth cap and monthly traffic plan) must be higher than the current specification.
- The CPU model of the underlying physical server can not be specified for the upgrade. Itâ€™s randomly assigned.
- The availability zone can not be changed in the upgrade.
- If the instance is using a fixed bandwidth package (1C1G, 20 GB SSD system disk and 1 Mbps bandwidth), as this package has been discontinued, you can upgrade it to a traffic package.
- To change the instance type, all the specifications, including the CPU, MEM, SSD system disk size, bandwidth/bandwidth cap and monthly traffic plan, must all be higher than the current specifications. 
- For the price of upgrading an instance, please refer to [Fees for Upgrading Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1103/41562).
