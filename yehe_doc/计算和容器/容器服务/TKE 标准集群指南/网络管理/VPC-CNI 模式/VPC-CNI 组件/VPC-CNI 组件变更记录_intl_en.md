VPC-CNI component contains three kubernetes cluster components: `tke-eni-agent`, `tke-eni-ipamd` and `tke-eni-ip-scheduler`. Generally, the versions of these components are the same. However, `tke-eni-ip-scheduler` is less modified, so its version may be a little earlier.

## Checking the Component Version

The component version is the image tag. You can check it via the kubernetes API.
```
# Checking the version of tke-eni-agent
kubectl -nkube-system get ds tke-eni-agent -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
# Checking the version of tke-eni-ipamd
kubectl -nkube-system get deploy tke-eni-ipamd -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
# Checking the version of tke-eni-ip-scheduler
kubectl -nkube-system get deploy tke-eni-ip-scheduler -o jsonpath={.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}
```

	<td>v3.3.9</td><td>2021-11-09 </td>
    <td>
<li> Fixed repeat creation of an EIP caused by the network.</li><li> Pods with independent ENIs in non-static IP address mode can be bound to an EIP.</li><li> Optimizes the mechanism of expansion resources for eni-agent to make the management of expansion resources more stable and robust.</li><li> Fixed the issues caused by inconsistency between quota set for the node and the actual quota.</li><li> Optimizes IP garbage collection mechanism for eni-agent.

<tr>
	<td>v3.3.5</td><td>2021-07-20 </td>

	<td>v3.3.4</td><td>2021-07-07 </td>
    <td>
<li> Fixed the issue where the component continues trying to unbind the ENI in the condition that the CVM has shut down.</li><li> Fixed the panic caused by the concurrent writes of asynchronous logs.</li><li> Optimizes the ENI synchronization logic in non-static IP address mode to ensure internal data consistency and prevent the ENIs in use from being unbound.</li><li> Fixed the issue where the existing nodes cannot allocate IPs caused by insufficient IPs in the subnet of the cluster upgrading from v3.2 in non-static IP address mode.</li><li> Fixed the issue where the ENI may be incorrectly released when the primary IP of the existing ENI is being used by the Pod.</li>
