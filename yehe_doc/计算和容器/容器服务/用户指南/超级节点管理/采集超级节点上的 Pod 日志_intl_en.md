This document describes how a Pod scheduled to a virtual node in a TKE cluster collect logs, including:
- [Collect logs to CLS](#toCLS)
- [Collect logs to Kafka](#toKafka)



## Collecting logs to CLS[](id:toCLS)

#### Authorizing a role to the service
To ensure that the logs are loaded onto CLS normally, you need to authorize a role to the service before collecting logs of the Pod on the virtual node to CLS.

Follow the steps below:
1. Log in to **CAM console** > **[Role](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/role)**.
2. Click **Create Role** on the "Role" page.
3. In the **Select role entity** dialog box, click **Tencent Cloud Product Service** > **TKE** > **TKE - EKS log collection**, and click **Next**, as shown below:

4. Confirm role policy, and click **Next**.
5. Review role policy, and click **Done** to complete role configuration.




#### Configuring log collection

You need to enable TKE log collection feature and configure corresponding log collection rule when you finished service role authorization. For example, you need to specify workload collection and Pod labels collection. For more information, see [Using CRD to Configure Log Collection via the Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/32419).



## Collecting logs to Kafka[](id:toKafka)

If you want to collect logs of the Pod on the virtual node to Kafka or CKafka, you need to configure CRD and define the collection source and consumer end. When the CRD is configured, the collector of the Pod will collect logs according to the rule.
The specific configuration of CRD is as follows:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  yaml
apiVersion: cls.cloud.tencent.com/v1
kind: LogConfig                          ## Default value
metadata:
  name: test                                ## CRD resource name, unique in the cluster
spec:
  kafkaDetail:
    brokers: xxxxxx       # A required item, broker address, generally it is domain name:port. If there are more than one address, separate them with ",".
    topic: xxxxxx         # A required item, topicID        
    messageKey:           # An optional item. You can specify the Pod field as the key to upload to the specified partition.
      valueFrom:
        fieldRef:
          fieldPath: metadata.name   
				timestampKey:            # The key of timestamp. Default value is @timestamp.
    timestampFormat:       # The format of timestamp. Default value is double.
  inputDetail:
    type: container_stdout                  ## Log collection type, including container_stdout (container standard output) and container_file (container file).

    containerStdout:                        ## Container standard output
      namespace: default                    ## The Kubernetes namespace of the container to be collected. If this parameter is not specified, it indicates all namespaces.
      allContainers: false                  ## Whether to collect the standard output of all containers in the specified namespace
      container: xxx                        ## Name of the container to be collected. This item can be left empty.
      includeLabels:                         ## Only Pods that contain the specified labels will be collected.
        k8s-app: xxx                        ## Only the logs generated by Pods with the configuration of "k8s-app=xxx" in the Pod labels will be collected. This parameter cannot be specified at the same time as workloads and allContainers=true.
      workloads:                            ## Kubernetes workload to which the container Pod to be collected belongs
      - namespace: prod                     ## Workload namespace
        name: sample-app                    ## Workload name
        kind: deployment                    ## Workload type. Supported values include deployment, daemonset, statefulset, job, and cronjob.
        container: xxx                      ## Name of the container to be collected. If this item is left empty, it indicates all containers in the workload Pod will be collected.
    
    containerFile:                          ## File in the container
      namespace: default                    ## The Kubernetes namespace of the container to be collected. A namespace must be specified.
      container: xxx                        ## Name of the container to be collected. You can enter a * for this item.
      includeLabels:                         ## Only Pods that contain the specified labels will be collected.
        k8s-app: xxx                        ## Only the logs generated by Pods with the configuration of "k8s-app=xxx" in the Pod labels are collected. This parameter cannot be specified at the same time as workload.
      workload:                             ## Kubernetes workload to which the container Pod to be collected belongs
        name: sample-app                    ## Workload name                  
        kind: deployment                    ## Workload type. Supported values include deployment, daemonset, statefulset, job, and cronjob.
      logPath: /opt/logs                    ## Log folder. Wildcards are not supported.
      filePattern: app_*.log                ## Log file name. It supports the wildcards "*" and "?". "*" matches multiple random characters, and "?" matches a single random character.
