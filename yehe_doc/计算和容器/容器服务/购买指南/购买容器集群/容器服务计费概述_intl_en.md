>! TKE is a declarative service based on Kubernetes. When you do not need CLB, CBS or other IaaS service resources created by TKE, you must delete them in TKE console, otherwise, TKE will re-create them and continue to charge fees. For example, if you delete a CLB instance in CLB console instead of in TKE console, TKE will re-create a CLB instance based on declarative APIs.
