## Workload Pod Template Annotation Description
You can define `spec.template.metadata.annotations` in a YAML file to implement capabilities such as binding security groups and allocating resources for Pods. For more information about the configuration method, see the following table.

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
- If no security group is specified, a Pod is bound with the `default` security group in the same region by default. Ensure that the network policy of the `default` security group does not affect the Pod.
- To allocate CPU resources through the method specified by annotation, you must specify both `cpu` and `mem` annotations and make sure that their values meet the CPU specifications in [Resource Specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34057). In addition, you can select Intel or AMD CPUs to allocate by specifying `cpu-type`. AMD CPUs are more cost-effective. For more information, see [Product Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34055). 
- To allocate GPU resources through the method specified by annotation, you must specify the `gpu-type` and `gpu-count` annotations and ensure that their values meet the GPU specifications in [Resource Specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34057).

## Virtual Node Annotation Description
EKS supports the virtual nodes. You can specify annotations in a YAML file to implement capabilities such as custom DNS, as shown below:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Annotation Key</th>
<th width="40%">Annotation Value and Description</th>
<th width="40%">Required</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>eks.tke.cloud.tencent.com/resolv-conf</td>
<td>Queries the list of IP addresses for the DNS server while resolving the domain name, for example <code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code>.
<br>You can use <code>kubectl edit node eklet-subnet-xxxx</code> to add this annotation.
<br>After the modification, the Pods scheduled to this virtual node will adopt this DNS configuration by default.</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Example
The example of a custom DNS configuration for a virtual node is as follows:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Node
metadata:
  annotations:
    eks.tke.cloud.tencent.com/resolv-conf:|
	  nameserver 4.4.4.4
      nameserver 8.8.8.8
```



## Service Annotation Description

EKS allows you to use existing CLBs to create Services accessed via the public or private network. If you want to provide your idle CLBs for Services to be created or need to use the same CLB in a cluster, you can add annotations.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="20%">Annotation Key</th>
<th width="40%">Annotation Value and Description</th>
<th width="40%">Required</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>service.kubernetes.io/tke-existed-lbid</td>
<td>The Service is created with the existing <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/524" target="_blank">CLB</a>. Specify the ID of the CLB instance you want to use as the value.</td>
<td>No. If you specify it, ensure that the specified CLB instance ID exists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>service.kubernetes.io/qcloud-share-existed-lb</td>
<td>By default, multiple Services cannot share the same CLB instance. If you hope that a Service uses the CLB occupied by other Services, please add this annotation and specify the value as <code>"true"</code>.</td>
<td>No. If you do not specify it, a CLB instance cannot be reused by default.</td>
</tr>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

The elastic cluster also supports the same expansion protocol as the TKE cluster. For more information, see [Service Extension Protocol](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/39141).

>!
>- Ensure that your EKS and the CVM do not share the same CLB.
>- When the existing CLBs are used:
>   - Only CLBs created through the CLB console can be used. You cannot reuse CLBs automatically created by TKE.
>   - Ports of Services that share the same existing CLB cannot be the same.
>   - Cross-cluster Services cannot share the same CLB.


### Example
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

  annotations:
    service.kubernetes.io/tke-existed-lbid: lb-pxxxxxxq
