>! The **Workflows** section of the MPS console has been replaced with **Schemes**, which offers easier and more flexible settings. To configure a scheme, go to **Schemes**.


## Overview
After you set up a workflow, media files uploaded to the specified bucket and directory will be processed automatically, and the results will be uploaded to the specified bucket and directory. Workflows can include tasks such as transcoding, screenshot taking, animated screenshot generating, moderation, content recognition, content analysis, and watermarking.

## Creating a Workflow[](id:create)
1. Log in to the [MPS console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/mps) and select **Workflows** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Workflow** to enter the workflow creation page and set the workflow name, trigger bucket, trigger directory, output bucket, output directory, event notifications and tasks. For detailed instructions, see [workflow configuration](#workflow).

## Event Notifications[](id:event)
### Receiving event notifications via CMQ
- Event notifications are disabled by default. To receive notifications via CMQ, click the toggle next to **Enable Event Notifications**, select queue or topic model for **CMQ Model**, and set the model name and region. MPS event notifications will be sent to the specified queue or topic.
- You can receive event notifications via CMQ only after you activate the CMQ service and create a queue or topic model. For more information, please see [CMQ > Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/406/8435).

### Receiving event notifications via SCF
SCF allows quick handling of the event notifications generated by MPS. The figure below shows the data flow.
<img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/02656fefa8e2f61f71252727747b7a02.png" style="zoom: 67%;" />
Events are pushed to SCF by the MPS trigger and are handled by serverless functions.

#### Use cases
CLS can deliver the data in log topics to SCF via an MPS log trigger to enable operations such as notification sending, status monitoring, and alarm handling.

| Function Processing Scenario | Description |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Video task backup to COS | Backing up the called back tasks of MPS to COS via SCF in a timely manner |
| Video task callback notifications | Receiving MPS data messages in real time and sending the messages to users via WeCom or email. |

>! Sending data to SCF will incur fees. For details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/17299).
