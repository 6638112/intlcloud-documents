 - Screenshot template: You can choose time point screenshot, sampled screenshot, or image sprite screenshot and select from the existing templates for each mode. For time point screenshot, you must also specify the time point. If existing templates do not meet your needs, you can create new ones in [**Template Settings** > **Screenshot Template**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mps/templates?tab=snapshot).
 - Watermark template: You can add up to 4 watermarks to each transcoding task. If existing watermarks do not meet your needs, you can create new ones in [**Template Settings** > **Watermark Template**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mps/templates?tab=watermark).

### How to create a video analysis template?
MPS provides [preset video analysis templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041/33476). You can also use a [server API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041/37470) to create and manage custom video analysis templates.

[](id:que4)
### How to use video analysis templates?
1. Initiate a video analysis task. You can **call an API** to initiate a task or configure **automatic triggering of a task upon video upload**.
2. After initiating a task, you can query the result synchronously or get the result asynchronously in the callback.

### Can I query newly finished tasks using `ScrollToken`?
You may not be able to query newly finished tasks using the pagination flag parameter `ScrollToken` because the tasks returned are sorted by creation time.
>? The pagination flag parameter `ScrollToken` is used when you paginate your queries. If itâ€™s impossible to query all tasks with one request, the API will return `ScrollToken`, which should be passed in for the next request so that it starts from the record following `ScrollToken`.

### How to query the task list?
For detailed directions, see the [DescribeTasks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041/33643) API.

### How are the tasks returned sorted?

### How to grant access to COS?

MPS needs read and write access to COS in order to download and transcode videos in COS buckets as well as upload files to buckets. Therefore, you need to create a service role and grant the role access to COS.
Directions:
1. Log in to the [MPS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mps) and click **Authorization Management** on the left sidebar. Click **Go to CAM** to go to the permission management page to grant the access. After MPS is authorized, the system will create a preset service role and grant MPS relevant access.

>! You cannot perform further operations in the MPS console before granting the access.
2. After authorization, return to the authorization management page, and you will see that the access has been granted successfully. You can revoke the access granted by clicking **Cancel Authorization** to go **CAM** and deleting the [service role](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/19388).
