The LVB recording solution has been connected to the APIs of LVB and VOD. The new API documentation is more standardized and comprehensive. The unified parameter style, common error codes, and SDK/CLI version are highly consistent with the API documentation, providing a simple and fast user experience. The support for nearby access in all regions allows faster connection to Tencent Cloud services.
