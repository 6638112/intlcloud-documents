LVB supports recording live streams and storing recording files in VOD for download and preview. This document describes how to create, bind, unbind, modify, and delete recording templates.
You can create a recording template in either of the following two methods:
- Create a recording template in the LVB console. For detailed directions, please see [Creating Recording Template](#C_record).
- Create a recording template with APIs. For specific parameters and samples, please see [CreateLiveRecordTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/267/30845).

## Notes
- The recorded video files are stored in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. We recommend you activate the VOD service in advance. For more information, please see [Getting Started with VOD](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/8757).
- After enabling the recording feature, please make sure that your VOD service is in normal status. If it is not activated or is suspended due to overdue payment, LVB recording will not be available, no recording files will be generated, and no recording fees will be incurred.
- During the live streaming, you can get a recording file in about 5 minutes after the recording process ends. For example, if you start recording a live stream at 12:00, you can get the corresponding clip for 12:00 to 12:30 at around 12:35.
- Subject to the audio and video file formats (FLV/MP4/HLS), the video encoding format of H.264 and audio encoding format of ACC are supported.
- After a recording template is created successfully, it can be bound to a push domain name. For more information, please see [Recording Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/34224). The binding will take effect in about 5â€“10 minutes.
- For the naming rules of generated recording files, please see [VodFileName](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/267/30767).
- Binding, unbinding, and modifying a template affect only new live streams after the update but not ongoing ones. To make the new rule take effect for ongoing live streams, you need to interrupt them and push them again.
- Stream mix-based recording does not support mixing streams in and outside Chinese mainland, as recording file errors will occur and affect normal playback.


## Prerequisites
- You have activated the LVB service and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have activated the [VOD service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/8757#.E6.AD.A5.E9.AA.A41.EF.BC.9A.E5.BC.80.E9.80.9A.E4.BA.91.E7.82.B9.E6.92.AD).

>- If the template has been bound with a domain name, you need to [unbind](#unite) the template before deleting it.
>- The recording templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled there for the time being. If you bound the recording configuration to a specified stream through the recording management API and want to unbind them, you need to call the [DeleteLiveRecordRule API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30843).

## FAQs
<span id="que1"></span>
#### How are videos generated by LVB recording named?
Recording files generated by the callback of a recording template created in the console are named in the following format by default:
`{StreamID}*{StartYear}-{StartMonth}-{StartDay}-{StartHour}-{StartMinute}-{StartSecond}*{EndYear}-{EndMonth}-{EndDay}-{EndHour}-{EndMinute}-{EndSecond} `

**Among them:**

| Placeholder             | Description          |
