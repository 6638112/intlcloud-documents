VOD automatically generates acceleration links for recording files stored in it.

## Notes
- VOD supports forbidding videos. After a video is forbidden, it cannot be watched. The forbidding takes effect in **5 minutes**.
- You can determine whether the video is forbidden or normal by the video status.


## Directions
1. Log in to the VOD console and click **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)** on the left sidebar on the **non-admin** page to enter the video list page.
2. Select the video you want to view, click **Quick View** in the **Video Name** column, or click **Manage** on the right to enter the **Basic Info** page and view the corresponding acceleration link.
