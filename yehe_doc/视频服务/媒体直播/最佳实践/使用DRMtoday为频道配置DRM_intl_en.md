## Step 1. Apply for an account

1. Sign up for a DRMtoday account.

   a. Sign up for a DRMtoday account on the [DRMtoday product page](https://castlabs.com/drmtoday/).
   ![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b1fa760d75f68f27c4470bf52f81b800.png)

   b. After signing up, you will receive a DRMtoday account, along with the password and the dashboard address.

2. Apply for a FairPlay certificate.

   a. Go to the [Apple FairPlay official website](https://developer.apple.com/streaming/fps/).

   b. Click [Request FPS Deployment Package](https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin.html?path=%2Fcontact%2Ffps%2F&appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757), enter and submit the information required.
   ![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9592e1021494896689ad0d7135f26560.png)

   c. Get the `FPS_Deployment_Package.zip` file.

   d. Decompress the file and create a local password-protected private key and CSR (certificate signing request) as described in the file.

   e. Submit the CSR to Apple as described in the file, and an application secret key (ASK) will be returned. Store it properly.

   f. Download the FairPlay certificate generated.


## Step 2. Upload the FairPlay certificate to DRMtoday

Go to the DRMtoday dashboard website and choose **Configuration** > **DRM settings**.
![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/352f6e951f0ca3252c5bf346ad19464b.png)
The parameters are described as follows:

- **Default IV**: leave it empty.

Check **Update certificate and keys**, and set the parameters as described below.

   - **Application secret key (ASK)**: enter the ASK obtained when applying for the FairPlay certificate (step 1) in hexadecimal format.
    
   - **Provider certificate**: enter the FairPlay certificate downloaded when applying for the FairPlay certificate (step 1). The certificate uploaded must be a PEM file. You can convert your certificate into a PEM file using OpenSSL on Linux. For example, for a certificate named `fairplay.cer`, the command for conversion is:

  ```
  openssl x509 -inform der -in fairplay.cer -out fairplay.pem
  ```

- **Provider private key**:

  the password-protected private key created. The key must be in the PKCS#8 PEM format. You can convert a key into the required format using OpenSSL on Linux. For example, for a key file named `privatekey.pem`, the command for conversion is:

  ```
  openssl rsa -in privatekey.pem -outform PEM -out out.pem
  ```



## Step 3. Configure the Widevine or FairPlay key via DRMtoday API

The operations in this step are based on DRMtodayâ€™s official document [DRMtoday Key Ingestion](https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/documentation/integration/key_ingestion.html).

1. CAS authentication
   DRMtoday uses CAS (Central Authentication Service) to protect its API from unauthorized access. For details, see [DRMtoday CAS Authentication](https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/documentation/integration/cas_authentication.html).

   a. CAS login: send an HTTP POST request to the login address.

   Example:

   ```
   curl -v 'https://auth.staging.drmtoday.com/cas/v1/tickets' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -XPOST -d 'username=${username}&amp;password=${password}'
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   - **username** and **password**: you may use your DRMtoday account and password or the API account and password created at DRMtoday. For details, see DRMtoday's [document on API account creation](https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/documentation/integration/dashboard.html? dummy#adding-accounts).

   b. CAS ticket retrieval: send an HTTP POST request to the location in the header of the response of the CAS login request.

   Example:

   ```
   curl -v 'https://auth.staging.drmtoday.com/cas/v1/tickets/xxx' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-formurlencoded'-XPOST -d 'service=https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/api/keys/v2/ingest/${merchantApiName}'
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   - **service**: the endpoint corresponding to the ingest key on the **Dashboard > API** page.
     ![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/299f6fdcdfd5016a48c4b41f530e277a.png)

2. Key setting
   After authentication, use the ingest key API to configure a Widevine or FairPlay key. For how to use the API, see [DRMtoday Key Ingestion](https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/documentation/integration/key_ingestion.html).
   Example:

   ```
   curl -v 'https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/api/keys/v2/ingest/${merchant}?ticket=${ticket}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -XPOST -d '{"assets":[{"type":"CENC","assetId":"assettest","variantId":"varianttest","ingestKeys":[{"streamType":"VIDEO_AUDIO","algorithm":"AES","keyId":"MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMA==","key":"MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMA==","iv":"MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMA=="}]}]}'
   ```

   The parameters are described as follows:

   - **merchant**: the endpoint corresponding to the ingest key in the dashboard.
   - **ticket**: the body of the response returned upon CAS ticket retrieval.
   - **type**: `CENC`, which supports Widevine and FairPlay. Widevine encryption requires a `keyId` and `key`, and FairPlay encryption requires a `key` and `iv`.
   - **keyId, key and iv**: must be encoded in the Base64 format. For example, `MDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAwMA==` is `30303030303030303030303030303030` after being converted into the hexadecimal format.



## Step 4. Configure the DRM key in StreamLive

See the DRM key configuration directions provided in [Configure output groups](link). Related parameters are described as follows:

- Enable **DRM**.
- For **Scheme**, select **Custom DRM Keys**.

FairPlay key:
![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d1fd0abc8a2c4b1aa970f74160641731.png)

- For **ContentId**, enter the `assetId` configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.
- For **Key**, enter the key configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.
- For **Iv**, enter the `iv` configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.

Widevine key:
![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d65d6a93e13b12d8014558a601a21692.png)

- For **ContentId**, enter the `assetId` configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.
- For **KeyId**, enter the `keyId` configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.
- For **Key**, enter the key configured during key configuration in step 3 in hexadecimal format.


## Step 5. Run the playback test

After configuring the playback address by referring to the StreamLive User Guide (for example, you can [output the live streams to a StreamPackage channel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1048/41760#6.-output-content-to-streampackage-through-streamlive)) and get the playback address from the StreamPackage endpoint (see [Console Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1063/41787)), you can run the playback test on the [DRMtoday playback page](https://players.castlabs.com/presto/6.1.2/#/player/config).
![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5b8b559d838497dd5b75cf9c7cedf363.png)
![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/77249ddf9131bc9578bdb28fc3c37fb4.png)
The parameters are described as follows:

- **Content URL**: the playback content URL
- **DRM Environment**: the DRM environment you use
- **Merchant**: name of the user at DRMtoday, which is often the same as **merchantApiName**
- **User ID and Session ID**: see the DRMtoday [configuration document](https://fe.staging.drmtoday.com/frontend/documentation/integration/dashboard.html#uisetting-Test_dummy) (when the **License Delivery Authorization** type is **Test_dummy**)
- **Asset ID**: enter the `assetId` configured during key configuration in step 3.
- **Variant ID**: enter the `variantId` configured during key configuration in step 3.
