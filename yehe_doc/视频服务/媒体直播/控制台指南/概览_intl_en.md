Tencent Cloud MediaLive is managed at the channel level in three major modules: input security group, input, and channel.

The security group module mainly manages the security verification of the input source. The input module can configure the protocol and input method of the channel input source. Finally, the channel module is the main module of MediaLive and can perform various video processing operations such as transcoding and remuxing on the input stream and then generate the output stream to the specified destination or archive.
