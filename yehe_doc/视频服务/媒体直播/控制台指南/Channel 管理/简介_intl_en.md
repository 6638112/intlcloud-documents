The StreamLive service is managed at the channel level in the StreamLive console. You can set up high-quality video streams and distribute them to various types of devices. The channel management module is the main module of StreamLive, via which you can perform various video processing operations such as transcoding and remuxing and send the results to the specified destination or store them on COS.

## Channel Management
Select **Channel Management** on the left sidebar. On this page, you can view, create, start/stop, delete, export, or clone channels. This page also shows the status of created channels. “IDLE” means a channel has not been started, and “RUNNING” means a channel is started. To edit a channel that has been started, you need to stop it first.
