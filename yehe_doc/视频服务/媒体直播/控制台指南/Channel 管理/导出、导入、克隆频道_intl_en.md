StreamLive allows you to import/export a channel configuration file and clone an existing channel.

## Exporting a channel
The **Channel Management** page shows the channels created and their state. Click **Export** in the **Operation** column to export a JSON file of the channelâ€™s configuration.

## Importing a channel
On the **Channel Management** page, click **Create Channel** and then click **Import Configuration**. Select the JSON file to import. You can then edit the imported channel and save the configuration.

The import feature allows you to quickly configure a channel. The console will auto-fill the information in **Basic Information** and **Output Group Setting** according to the JSON file you select, but will ignore the **Input Setting** information of the file. You still need to select the inputs to bind.

>! If you import a configuration file when editing a channel, the existing configurations will be overwritten.

## Cloning a channel
Channel cloning is essentially a quick channel exporting and importing process. On the **Channel Management** page, click **Clone** in the **Operation** column. You will enter the configuration page of the new channel.

StreamLive will complete the channel configurations (except **Input Setting**) automatically according to the cloned channel. Complete the rest of the configurations and submit them.
