You can bind one or more inputs to a channel. The first input bound will be used as the default input, while others may be used for failover or by the plan.
From the drop-down list of **Add Input**, select an input thatâ€™s not already bound to another channel. You can bind up to five inputs to each channel, including two PUSH inputs.
