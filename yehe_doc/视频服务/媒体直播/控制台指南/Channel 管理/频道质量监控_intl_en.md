## Alerts
If a problem occurs or is likely to occur in any pipeline of a channel, StreamLive will generate an alert for the channel. **Set time** is the time when the alert is generated, and **Cleared time** is the time when the alert is cleared. The state of an alert changes. When the alert state is **SET**, the **Set time** and **State** columns are highlighted in red. After an alert is cleared, its state changes to **CLEARED**, and the highlighting is removed. You can query alert data, including the problematic pipeline, alert type, and other details, for a time period of less than 24 hours in the last 5 days.

## Health
The **Heath** tab displays information about a channelâ€™s inputs (bandwidth and input video/audio frame rate) and outputs (bandwidth), which help you determine whether the current channel is working properly. You can query data for a time period of less 24 hours in the last 5 days.
