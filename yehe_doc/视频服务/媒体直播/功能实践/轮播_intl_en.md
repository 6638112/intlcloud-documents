Video looping is a typical use case of input switch. For how to configure input switch, see the previous document. You can use this feature to play teasers on loop before a live stream starts or replay a live streaming session repeatedly after it ends.

The video looping feature plays existing videos, so the input type should be **MP4_PULL** or **HLS_PULL**. If your channel is not currently bound with such inputs, add one first before you configure an input switch event. The figure below shows the configuration for a typical input switch event for PULL inputs. You can specify two inputs for failover.
