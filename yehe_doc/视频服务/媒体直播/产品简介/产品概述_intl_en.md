## Mapping Relationship of MediaLive Input Streams

Each MediaLive channel supports setting two pipelines (e.g. pipeline A and B) when configuring the input. Pipeline A (required) and Pipeline B (optional) run independently. That is, the stream from input A will be output to the destination A of each output group, and the stream from input B will be output to the destination B of each output group. (When the output type is MediaPackage, Pipeline A and Pipeline B will be input to the MediaPackage channel as two streams.)

The relationship diagram between the output group and output is as follows:

Each output group, which can contain multiple outputs, determines an output protocol or type. Each output can select video streams with different resolutions and bitrates to combine and output a live stream with adaptive bitrates.
