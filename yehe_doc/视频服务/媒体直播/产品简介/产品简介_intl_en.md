Tencent Cloud MediaLive (MDL) is a dedicated platform to provide an ultra-fast, stable, and high-quality live streaming media processing services for global users. Leveraging the compute resources in Tencent Cloud's abundant AZs deployed around the globe and proprietary well-established audiovisual platforms and world-leading AI technologies in audio and video, MediaLive unveils the core capabilities of Tencent Cloud live streaming to provide developers with professional, stable, and efficient basic services such as live stream transcoding, remuxing, and transfer, as well as value-added services such as DRM and SCTE-35 ad solution.

## Key Features

### Stream input over multiple protocols and in multiple methods

MediaLive supports multiple streaming media input protocols such as RTP, RTMP, UDP, HLS, and HTTP-MP4 as well as the pull and push input methods. Plus, it allows inputting video stream with multiple audio tracks and configuring transcoding separately for each audio track when RTP-MPEGTS is used.

### Authentication with security group

MediaLive provides protection policies at the CIDR security group level for input streams. A security group can be used to verify the validity of the input source's IPv4 address, which makes the input of MediaLive channels more secure.

### Diversified transcoding

MediaLive supports transcoding at multiple resolutions (SD, HD, UHD, 2K, 4K, etc.), bitrates, and frame rates. In addition, it provides top speed codec transcoding, which is a high-performance transcoding service. After this feature is enabled, AI algorithms can be used to calculate the optimal dynamic encoding parameters based on the business scenario in real time to implement transcoding services with low bitrate and high quality.

### Remuxing in multiple formats

MediaLive supports various output muxing types, such as adaptive bitrate HLS, DASH, and HLS archive.

### DRM

MediaLive features a more specialized digital rights management (DRM) solution to fully protect the security of your video assets. Currently, it supports the FairPlay and Widevine encryption schemes to satisfy most needs in digital copyrights protection.

### Flexible configuration for independent channels and diverse output combinations

MediaLive provides services based on the channel management mode, where the same channel can be configured with different inputs and outputs. For the same output, you can combine output configurations flexibly by associating created audio and video transcoding templates, so as to implement distribution based on adaptive bitrate.

### Stream quality monitoring

MediaLive offers detailed health reports on the running status of each channel and displays information of alerts in various types, making it easy for you to monitor the stream quality in real time.
