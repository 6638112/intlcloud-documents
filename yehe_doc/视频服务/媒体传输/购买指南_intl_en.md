| Billable Item | Description | Billing Mode |
| -----------------| ---| --------- |
| Transfer |The transfer fee is charged based on the sum of the peak bandwidth used by each flow in a day. | Daily pay-as-you-go |
| Device running |The device running fee is charged based on the number of inputs and outputs and their running hours in a day. | Daily pay-as-you-go |
| Relaying traffic |If you relay video to third parties, you will be charged based on the amount of traffic relayed in a day. The pricing of relaying traffic varies with region and the highest bandwidth supported is 8 Mbps. | Daily pay-as-you-go |

### Transfer

#### Pricing

You can create transfer links in the StreamLink console, which are charged based on the peak bandwidth used in a day.

| Billable Item | Billing Method | Price |
| -----------------| ---| --------- |
| Transfer|Peak outbound bandwidth in a day | 7.6923 USD/Mbps/day |

#### Billing example

Assume that you created flows A and B with StreamLink on January 1, 2022. The bandwidth usage of flow A and flow B peaked at 12:00 noon and 10:00 PM respectively, both reaching 10 Mbps. On January 2, 2022, you would be charged the following transfer fee:
7.6923 (USD/Mbps/day) x 20 (Mbps) = 153.846 USD



### Device running

#### Pricing

The device running cost of StreamLink is as follows:

| Billable Item     | Billing Method                               | Price             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Device running | Sum of the running hours of each input/output| 0.25 USD/input or output/hour |


>!
>- If a flow has 1 input and 3 outputs, the device running cost will quadruple.
>- If your task contains a primary flow and a backup flow, you will be charged the running cost of 2 flows.
>- The device running cost is calculated by the hour and charged on a daily basis, and durations are rounded to the next hour.

#### Billing example

Assume that you created 1 input and 2 outputs and used them for 6 hours on January 1, 2022. On January 2, 2022, you would be charged the following device running cost:

3 (number of inputs and outputs) x 6 (hours) x 0.25 (USD/hour) = 4.5 USD
