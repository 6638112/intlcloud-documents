## Features

**Multi-Protocol Primary/Backup Inputs**

StreamLink can transfer streaming media over multiple protocols such as RTP, SRT, UDP, and RTMP. In addition, it automatically supports redundancy configuration by providing primary and backup input addresses for each flow to ensure the flow stability and reliability.

**Comprehensive Flow Quality Monitoring**

StreamLink offers detailed health reports on the running status of each flow and provides various types of alerts, making it easy for you to monitor the flow quality in real time.

**High Stability and Low Latency**

StreamLink can optimize the transfer path according to the destination address to provide stable live streaming transfer services across continents with a latency as low as less than 1 second.

**One-Flow-Multi-Node Transfer**

StreamLink supports a one-flow-multi-node transfer mechanism, through which multiple output nodes can be added for the same flow to transfer the flow to different regions.

**Protocol Remuxing Support**

StreamLink supports remuxing from and to the RTP, SRT, and RTMP streaming media protocols, which means that one flow can be remuxed into the RTP, SRT, and RTMP streams at the same time.

**High Scalability**

StreamLink can work with other Tencent Cloud services such as StreamLive, StreamPackage, LVB, and CDN to implement fully integrated large-scale broadcast-grade one-stop media services.
