We have released version 10.1 of the LiteAV SDK for mobile devices (Android, iOS, and Flutter). The new version uses the same playback engine that powers Tencent Video and comes with optimized playback features. For details, see [What’s New](#up).

In this new version, you will need a license to use the **video playback** module.

You can **apply for a license for free to use the live and on-demand playback capabilities of the new SDK**. For detailed directions, see [Free License](#warrant). You don’t need a license if you don’t use the video playback features or if you haven’t updated to v10.1 or later versions.

>! **If your app already has a live streaming license or UGSV license, you can continue to use the video playback features after updating to v10.1.** You can view your license information in the [CSS console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/live) or the [VOD console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/vod).
