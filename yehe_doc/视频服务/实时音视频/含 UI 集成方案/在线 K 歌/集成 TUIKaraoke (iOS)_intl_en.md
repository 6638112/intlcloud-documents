## Component Overview

`TUIKaraoke` is an open-source audio/video UI component. After integrating it into your project, you can make your application support the online karaoke scenario and try out the TRTC capabilities such as karaoke, seat management, gift giving/receiving, and text chat simply by writing a few lines of code. It also supports the Android platform. Its basic features are as shown below:

<table>
     <tr>
         <th width=20%  style="text-align:center">Chat</th>  
         <th width=20%  style="text-align:center">Sound Effect Management</th>  
     </tr>

</tr>
</table>



## Component Integration
### Step 1. Download and import the `TUIKaraoke` component

Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUIKaraoke), clone or download the code, copy the `Source`, `Resources`, and `TXAppBasic` folders and the `TUIKaraoke.podspec` file in the `iOS` directory to your project, and complete the following import operations:

- Add the following import commands to your `Podfile`:
```
pod 'TUIKaraoke', :path => "./", :subspecs => ["TRTC"]
pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC'
pod 'TXAppBasic', :path => "TXAppBasic/"
```
- Open Terminal and run the following installation command in the directory of the `Podfile`:
```
pod install
```

### Step 2. Configure permissions
Configure permission requests for your app in the `info.plist` file of your project. The SDKs need the following permissions (on iOS, the mic access must be requested at runtime):
```
 <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
    <string>`TUIKaraoke` needs to access your mic.</string>
```


### Step 3. Initialize and log in to the component
For more information the relevant APIs, see [TRTCKaraoke (iOS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942).
```swift
  // 1. Initialize
  let karaokeRoom = TRTCKaraokeRoom.shared()
  karaokeRoom.setDelegate(delegate: self)
  // 2. Log in
  karaokeRoom.login(SDKAppID: Int32(SDKAppID), UserId: UserId, UserSig: ProfileManager.shared.curUserSig()) { code, message in
		if code == 0 {
			// Logged in
		}
  }
```
**Parameter description:**
- **SDKAppID**: **TRTC application ID**. If you haven't activated the TRTC service, log in to the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app), create a TRTC application, and click **Application Info**. The `SDKAppID` is as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/435d5615e0c4075640bb05c49884360c.png)
- **Secretkey**: **TRTC application key**, which corresponds to `SDKAppID`. On the [Application Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app) page in the TRTC console, the `SecretKey` is as shown below:
- **userId**: Current user ID, which is a string and can contain up to 32 bytes of letters and digits (special symbols are not supported). You can customize it based on your actual account system.
- **userSig**: Security protection signature calculated based on `SDKAppID`, `userId`, and `Secretkey`. You can click [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/usersigtool) to directly generate a debugging `userSig` online or calculate it on your own by referring to the [TUIKaraoke demo project](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUICalling/blob/main/Android/App/src/main/java/com/tencent/liteav/demo/LoginActivity.java#L74). For more information, see [UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).


### Step 4. Implement the online karaoke scenario
1. **The anchor creates a room through [TUIKaraoke.createRoom](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942)**.
```swift
int roomId = "Room ID";
let param = RoomParam.init()
param.roomName = "Room name";
param.needRequest = false; // Whether your consent is required for listeners to speak
param.seatCount = 8;       // Number of seats in the room. Set it to `8`
param.coverUrl = "URL of room cover image";

karaokeRoom.createRoom(roomID: Int32(roomInfo.roomID), roomParam: param) { [weak self] (code, message) in
	guard let `self` = self else { return }
	if code == 0 {
        // Room created successfully
	}
}
```
2. **A listener enters the room through [TUIKaraoke.enterRoom](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942)**.
```swift
karaokeRoom.enterRoom(roomID: roomInfo.roomID) { [weak self] (code, message) in
	guard let `self` = self else { return }
	if code == 0 {
		// Entered room successfully
	}
}
```
3. ***A listener mics on through [TUIKaraoke.enterSeat](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942)**.
```swift
// 1. A listener calls an API to mic on
int seatIndex = 1; 
karaokeRoom.enterSeat(seatIndex: seatIndex) { [weak self] (code, message) in
	guard let `self` = self else { return }
	if code == 0 {
		// Mic turned on successfully
	}
}
// 2. The listener receives the `onSeatListChange` callback and refreshes the seat list
func onSeatListChange(seatInfoList: [SeatInfo]) {
}
```

>? You can implement other seat management operations as instructed in [TRTCKaraoke (iOS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942) or by referring to the [TUIKaraoke demo project](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUIKaraoke/).

4. **Play back songs and try out the karaoke scenario**
You can get the music ID and URL to play back a song based on your business. For more information, see [Music Playback APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942#.E9.9F.B3.E4.B9.90.E6.92.AD.E6.94.BE.E6.8E.A5.E5.8F.A32).
```swift
// Play back the music
karaokeRoom.startPlayMusic(musicID: musicID, originalUrl: muscicLocalPath, accompanyUrl: accompanyLocalPath);
// Stop the music
karaokeRoom.stopPlayMusic();
```

After completing the previous steps, you can implement the basic karaoke features. If your business needs more features such as chat and gift giving, you can integrate the following capabilities:

### Step 6. Add the text chat feature (optional)
If you want the text chat feature between anchors and listeners, implement message sending/receiving as follows:
For more information on relevant APIs, see [sendRoomTextMsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41942#sendroomtextmsg).
```swift
// Sender: Sends text messages
karaokeRoom.sendRoomTextMsg(message: message) { [weak self] (code, message) in
	if code == 0 {
		// Sent successfully
	}
}
// Receiver: Listens for text messages
karaokeRoom.setDelegate(delegate: self)
func onRecvRoomTextMsg(message: String, userInfo: UserInfo) {
	debugPrint("Received a message from" + userInfo.userName + ": " + message)
}
```

### Step 7. Add the gift giving feature (optional)
You can implement gift giving, receiving, and displaying as follows:
```swift
// Sender: Customize `IMCMD_GIFT` to distinguish between gift messages
karaokeRoom.sendRoomCustomMsg(cmd: kSendGiftCmd, message: message) { code, msg in
	if (code == 0) {
		// Sent successfully
	}
}

// Receiver: Listens for gift messages
karaokeRoom.setDelegate(delegate: self)
func onRecvRoomCustomMsg(cmd: String, message: String, userInfo: UserInfo) {
	if cmd == kSendGiftCmd {
		debugPrint("Received a gift from" + userInfo.userName + ": " + message)
	}
}
```

## FAQs

### Does the `TUIKaraoke` component support sound effect features such as voice change, tone change, and reverb?
