`TRTCLiveRoom` is based on Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) and Instant Messaging (IM). Its features include:

- A user can create a room and start live streaming, or enter a room as an audience member.
- The anchor can co-anchor with audience members in the room.
- Anchors in two rooms can compete and interact with each other.
- All users can send text and custom messages. Custom messages can be used to send on-screen comments, give likes, and send gifts.

>?The TUIKit series of components are based on two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud, namely [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35448). When you activate TRTC, the IM SDK Trial Edition will be activated by default, which will support up to 100 DAUs. For IM billing details, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

`TRTCLiveRoom` is an open-source class depending on two closed-source Tencent Cloud SDKs. For the specific implementation process, please see [Interactive Live Video Streaming (iOS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/36060).

- TRTC SDK: The [TRTC SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615) is used as a low-latency live streaming component.
- IM SDK: The `AVChatRoom` feature of the [IM SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996) is used to implement chat rooms, and IM messages are used to facilitate the co-anchoring process.

| callback | (_ code: Int, _ message: String?) -> Void | Callback for the operation                                  |


**Common playback scenario**

- If the room list contains anchors’ `userID`, after entering a room, a user can call `startPlay(userID)` to play the anchor's video.
- If a user does not have the anchor's `userID` before room entry, he or she can find it in the `onAnchorEnter(userID)` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`, which is returned after room entry, and can then call `startPlay(userID)` to play the anchor’s video.

**Co-anchoring scenario**
After co-anchoring starts, the anchor will receive the `onAnchorEnter(userID)` callback from `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate` and can call `startPlay(userID), passing in the `userID` obtained from the callback to play the co-anchoring user’s video.



### stopPlay

## APIs for Anchor-Audience Co-anchoring

### requestJoinAnchor

| timeout | long | Timeout period for the co-anchoring request |
| responseCallback | (_ agreed: Bool, _ reason: String?) -> Void | Callback of the anchor’s response |

The process of co-anchoring between anchors and audience members is as follows:

1. A **viewer** calls `requestJoinAnchor()` to send a co-anchoring request to the anchor.
2. The **anchor** receives the `onRequestJoinAnchor()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`.
3. The **anchor** calls `responseJoinAnchor()` to accept or reject the co-anchoring request.
4. The **viewer** receives the `responseCallback` callback, which carries the anchor’s response.
5. If the request is accepted, the **viewer** calls `startCameraPreview()` to enable local camera preview.
6. The **viewer** calls `startPublish()` to push streams.
7. After the viewer starts pushing streams, the **anchor** receives the `onAnchorEnter()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`.
8. The **anchor** calls `startPlay()` to play the co-anchoring viewer’s video.
9. If there are other viewers co-anchoring with the anchor in the room, the new co-anchoring **viewer** will receive the `onAnchorEnter()` callback and can call `startPlay()` to play other co-anchoring viewers’ video.


### responseJoinAnchor

NS_SWIFT_NAME(responseJoinAnchor(userID:agree:reason:));
```

The parameters are described below:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------- | ------------------------- |
| userID | String  | The user ID of the audience member.                  |
| agree | Bool | `true`: accept; `false`: reject |

| responseCallback | (_ agreed: Bool, _ reason: String?) -> Void | Callback of the response |

Anchors in different rooms can communicate with each other. The process of starting cross-room communication between anchor A and anchor B is as follows:

1. **Anchor A** calls `requestRoomPK()` to send a cross-room communication to anchor B.
2. **Anchor B** receives the `onRequestRoomPK()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`.
3. **Anchor B** calls `responseRoomPK()` to respond to the cross-room communication request.
4. If **anchor B** accepts the request, he or she would wait for the `onAnchorEnter()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate` and call `startPlay()` to play anchor A's video.
5. **Anchor A** receives the `responseCallback` callback, which carries anchor B’s response.
6. If the request is accepted, **anchor A** waits for the `onAnchorEnter()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate` and calls `startPlay()` to play anchor B’s video.

## Callback APIs for Entry/Exit of Anchors/Audience

### onAnchorEnter

Callback for a new anchor/co-anchoring viewer. Audience will receive this callback when there is a new anchor/co-anchoring viewer in the room and can call `startPlay()` of `TRTCLiveRoom` to play the video of the anchor/co-anchoring viewer.
