`TRTCLiveRoom` is based on Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) and Instant Messaging (IM). Its features include:
- A user can create a room and start live streaming, or enter a room as an audience member.
- The anchor can co-anchor with audience members in the room.
- Anchors in two rooms can compete and interact with each other.
- All users can send text and custom messages. Custom messages can be used to send on-screen comments, give likes, and send gifts.

>?The TUIKit series of components are based on two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud, namely [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35448). When you activate TRTC, the IM SDK Trial Edition will be activated by default, which will support up to 100 DAUs. For IM billing details, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

`TRTCLiveRoom` is an open-source class depending on two closed-source Tencent Cloud SDKs. For the specific implementation process, please see [Interactive Live Video Streaming (Android)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/36061).
- TRTC SDK: The [TRTC SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615) is used as a low-latency live streaming component.
- IM SDK: The `AVChatRoom` feature of the [IM SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996) is used to implement chat rooms, and IM messages are used to facilitate the co-anchoring process.

6. The **viewer** calls `startPublish()` to push streams.
7. After the viewer starts pushing streams, the **anchor** receives the `onAnchorEnter()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`.
8. The **anchor** calls `startPlay()` to play the co-anchoring viewer’s video.
9. If there are other viewers co-anchoring with the anchor in the room, the new co-anchoring **viewer** will receive the `onAnchorEnter()` callback and can call `startPlay()` to play other co-anchoring viewers’ video.

2. **Anchor B** receives the `onRequestRoomPK()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate`.
3. **Anchor B** calls `responseRoomPK()` to respond to the cross-room communication request.
4. If **anchor B** accepts the request, he or she would wait for the `onAnchorEnter()` callback of `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate` and call `startPlay()` to play anchor A's video.
5. **Anchor A** receives the `responseCallback` callback, which carries anchor B’s response.
