## Version 4.0.0 Released on October 11, 2019

Provided APIs in the Client/Stream format, allowing for clearer role assignment and naming.
The new version is not compatible with the legacy version. In addition to APIs, the new version introduced the following changes:

- Changed the method of setting video attributes. All video attributes (resolution, frame rate, and bitrate) are now set using the `localStream.setVideoProfile()` API of the SDK via applications. The new version does not support setting video attributes via “Image Settings” (Spear Role) in the Tencent Cloud console.
- Integrated an audio/video player into the stream object. Playback is now solely controlled by the SDK.
- Supported subscribing to and unsubscribing from remote audio/video streams via the `client.subscribe()` and `client.unsubscribe()` APIs.
