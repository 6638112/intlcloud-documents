## v8.4.1 Released on March 26, 2021

**New features**
- macOS: supported capturing system audio via [startSystemAudioLoopback](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/electron_sdk/docs/TRTCCloud.html#startSystemAudioLoopback), i.e., the system loopback feature that is enabled on Windows. The feature allows the SDK to capture system audio so that anchors can stream local audio or video files to other users.
- macOS: supported callback of the system audio capturing result via [onSystemAudioLoopbackError](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/electron_sdk/docs/TRTCCallback.html#event:onSystemAudioLoopbackError), which allows you to learn about the status of the system audio driver.
- macOS: supported local preview for screen sharing. You can now display screen sharing preview in a small window.
- All platforms: supported the beauty filter plugin architecture.

**Quality improvement**
- All platforms: improved audio quality in the [TRTCAudioQualityMusic](http://doc.qcloudtrtc.com/group__TRTCCloudDef__ios.html#ga865e618ff3a81236f9978723c00e86fb) mode, which makes it more suitable for Clubhouse-like audio streaming scenarios.
- All platforms: improved the adaptability to poor network conditions across the audio-video link. Smooth audio and video can be delivered under 70% of extremely poor network conditions.
- Windows: improved audio quality in some streaming scenarios by significantly reducing audio damage.
- Windows: improved performance by 20-30% in some scenarios.

**Bug fixing**
- macOS: fixed the issue where after the screen sharing user switched to sharing the desktop and then back to a specific window on Mac mini (M1), remote users still saw the userâ€™s desktop.
- macOS: fixed the issue where the shared content was not highlighted (on macOS 11.1 and 10.14.5, the green border did not show around the shared content; on macOS 10.3.2, the green border showed, but the shared window flickered when maximized.)
- macOS: fixed the issue where the SDK crashed when users got the screen sharing list on Mac mini (M1) and "" was returned when `sourceName` was null.
- macOS: fixed the issue on Mac mini (M1) where the SDK crashed when `getCurrentMicDevice` was called because `sourceName` was empty.
- Windows: fixed the issue where the SDK crashed when the desktop was shared on Windows Server 2019 Datacenter x64.
- Windows: fixed the issue where screen sharing sometimes ended unexpectedly when the target window was resized during screen sharing.
- Windows: fixed the issue of image capturing failure with some cameras.
