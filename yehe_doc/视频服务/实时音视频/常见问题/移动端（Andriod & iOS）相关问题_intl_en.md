### Which system volume types are supported by the mobile client (for Android/iOS)?
Two system volume types, i.e., call volume and media volume, are supported.
- Call volume is specially designed for call scenarios on mobile phones. It uses the acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) feature built in phones and has a lower sound quality than media volume, and its volume level cannot be adjusted to 0 with volume buttons, but it supports mics on Bluetooth earphones.
- Media volume is specially designed for music scenarios on mobile phones. It has a higher sound quality than call volume, and its volume level can be adjusted to 0 with volume buttons. When using it, if you want to enable the AEC feature, the SDK will enable its built-in acoustic processing algorithms to further process the audio. With media volume, only the mics on phones instead of those on Bluetooth earphones can be used to capture audio.

### How do I set the resolution to 1080p for push in the mobile SDK?
1080p is defined as 114 in `TX_Enum_Type_VideoResolution`. You can directly set the resolution by passing in the enumerated value.
