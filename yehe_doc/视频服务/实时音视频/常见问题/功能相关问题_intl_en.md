### What is a `RoomID` in TRTC? What is its value range?
A `RoomID` (room ID) uniquely identifies a room and can range from 1 to 4294967295. You are responsible for maintaining and assigning the Room IDs of your applications.

[](id:que2)
### What is a `UserID` in TRTC? What is its value range? 
A `UserID` (user ID) uniquely identifies a user in a TRTC application. It can contain letters (case sensitive), digits, and underscores, preferably not longer than 32 bytes.


[](id:que3)
### How long is the lifecycle of a TRTC room?
- The first user who enters a room is the owner of the room, but cannot close the room.
- **In the call modes**, TRTC closes a room when all users exit the room.
- **In the live streaming modes**, if the last user who exits a room is an anchor, TRTC will close the room immediately; if the user is a viewer, TRTC will close the room in 10 minutes.
- A user will be removed from a room 90 seconds after unexpected disconnection. If all users are unexpectedly disconnected, the room will be closed after 90 seconds.
- If a user attempts to enter a room that does not exist, TRTC will automatically create a room with the ID entered.

[](id:que4)
