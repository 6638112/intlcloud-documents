### What do the errors `NotFoundError`, `NotAllowedError`, `NotReadableError`, `OverConstrainedError`, and `AbortError` found in the log of the SDK for desktop browser mean?


 | Error | Description | Suggested Solution | 
|---------|---------|---------|
| NotFoundError	 | No media types (including audio, video, and screen sharing) that meet the request parameters are found. <br>For example, this error will occur if the PC has no camera but the browser is requested to get a video stream.	 | Remind the user to check the required devices such as camera or mic before making a call. If there are no cameras and it is required to make an audio call, specify to capture the mic only in [TRTC.createStream({ audio: true, video: false })](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/web/docs/TRTC.html?_ga=1.250015174.1562552652.1542703643#.createStream). | 
| NotAllowedError	| The user has rejected the request to access audio, video, or screen sharing made by the current browser instance.	| Inform the user that it is impossible to make video/audio calls without camera/mic access. | 
| NotReadableError 	| The user has granted access to the required device, but it is inaccessible due to an error in a certain hardware device on the operating system, browser, or webpage. 	| Process in response to the error reported by the browser and inform the user that "The camera/mic is temporarily inaccessible. Please make sure that no other applications are requesting access to the camera/mic and try again". | 
| OverConstrainedError| 	The value of the `cameraId/microphoneId` parameter is invalid. 	| Make sure that the value of the `cameraId/microphoneId` parameter is correct and valid. | 
| AbortError	| The device cannot be used for an unknown reason. | - |

### Does the SDK for desktop browser support dual-channel encoding mode with big and small images similar to enableSmallVideoStream?	
No.

<span id="que9"></span>
### How do I clear the data in the camera list if the camera is removed during the use of the SDK for desktop browser?
You can try calling [getCameras](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/web/docs/TRTC.html?_ga=1.48566118.1562552652.1542703643#.getCameras) to get the new device list. If there is still information of the removed camera, it indicates that the browser has not refreshed the list, and the SDK for desktop browser cannot get the new device list.

<span id="que10"></span>
### How does the SDK for desktop browser record pure audio push? Why canâ€™t I record while auto-relay and auto-recording are enabled in the console?	
You need to set the `pureAudioPushMode` parameter of [createClient](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/web/docs/TRTC.html?_ga=1.212323796.1562552652.1542703643#.createClient).

<span id="que11"></span>
### Can the SDK for desktop browser get the current volume level?
Yes, it can get the current volume level through [getAudioLevel](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/web/docs/LocalStream.html?_ga=1.215278807.1562552652.1542703643#getAudioLevel).

<span id="que12"></span>
### Can I change the style of the screen sharing popup of the SDK for desktop browser?	
No, as it is controlled by the browser and thus cannot be modified.

<span id="que13"></span>
### Does the resolution of push set by the SDK for desktop browser by using width and height apply to all browsers?
Due to the restrictions of the device and browser, the video resolution may not be able to match exactly. In this case, the browser will automatically adjust the resolution to make it close to the resolution corresponding to `Profile`. For more information, please see [setVideoProfile](https://trtc-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/web/docs/LocalStream.html?#setVideoProfile).

<span id="que14"></span>
### How do I check whether the SDK for desktop browser can get the device (camera/mic) list properly?
1. Check whether the browser can use the devices properly:
Open the console directly on the page and enter `navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` to check whether the device list can be obtained.
 - If the device list is obtained, a `Promise` will be returned, where there is an array of `MediaDeviceInfo` objects and each object in the array corresponds to an available media device.
 - If the enumeration fails, the `Promise` will return `rejected`, indicating that the browser has not recognized the device, and you need to check the browser or device.
2. If the device list can be obtained, enter `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })` to check whether the `MediaStream` object can be returned properly. If it is not returned, the browser has not obtained the data, and you need to check the browser configuration.

<span id="que15"></span>
### What should I do if the SDK for desktop browser encounters an echo or noise issue?
If you hear an echo or noise from the SDK for desktop browser on other devices, it indicates that 3A processing has not taken effect.
The WebRTC standard provides a set of 3A algorithms which allows you to control 3A processing by enabling or disabling AEC, ANS, and AGC in `MediaTrackConstrains` of `audio`. If you encounter issues such as echo, noise, and low volume level, you can control echo cancellation, noise suppression, and volume gain by controlling the `echoCancellation`, `noiseSuppression`, and `autoGainControl` attributes respectively during `createStream` in the `localstream` of the SDK for desktop browser.
If any of the following circumstances occurs, it indicates that the browser is not compatible with the hardware device, and we recommend you replace or check the device.
- The echo issue persists when `echoCancellation` is set to `true`.
- The background noise persists when `noiseSuppression` is set to `true`.
- The volume is still low when `autoGainControl` is set to `true`.

For more information, please see [MediaTrackConstraints](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints).

### How do I capture the audio played back by the shared application on Windows?
You can call [startSystemAudioLoopback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35131) API to enable system audio capturing.

<span id="que18"></span>
### How do anchors initiate audio/video connections to viewers in conference mode on Windows?
The conference mode can be used in combination with [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996) to implement audio/video connection.

The processing logic is as follows: A sends a message X (with custom the display effect) to B and the calling page is triggered, then B receives X and the called page is triggered. B clicks [enterRoom](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35131) to enter the room and sends a custom message X1 to A, then A receives X1 (customizes whether to display it) and clicks `enterRoom` to enter the room. At this point, they can use IM to send custom messages.

<span id="que19"></span>
### How do viewers watch the video image in the room?
When the live stream mode is used, viewers enter the room and get the `userid` of anchor by using `[onUserVideoAvailable](http://doc.qcloudtrtc.com/group__ITRTCCloudCallback__cplusplus.html#a091f1c94ff1e2bc39c36e9d34285e87a)` in `TRTCCloudDelegate` (people who is co-anchoring is also an anchor for viewers and can also call [enterRoom](http://doc.qcloudtrtc.com/group__ITRTCCloud__cplusplus.html#ac73c4ad51eda05cd2bcec820c847e84f) to enter the room), and then viewers can call [startRemoteView](http://doc.qcloudtrtc.com/group__ITRTCCloud__cplusplus.html#a33a6e3765d6ca52d572224bc6e25dbcb) to watch the video image of the anchor.
