This document describes how to quickly run the demo for the TRTC Flutter SDK.

>! Currently, screen sharing and device selection are not supported on Windows or macOS.

## Environment Requirements
- Flutter 2.0 or later
- **Developing for Android:**
  - Android Studio 3.5 or later
  - Devices with Android 4.1 or later
- **Developing for iOS and macOS:**
  - Xcode 11.0 or later
  - OS X 10.11 or later
  - A valid developer signature for your project
- **Developing for Windows:**
    - OS: Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit based on x86-64)
    - Disk space: At least 1.64 GB of space after the IDE and relevant tools are installed
    - [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/zh-hans/downloads/)

## Prerequisites
You have [signed up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com).

## Directions

### Step 1. Create an application

1. Log in to the TRTC console and select [Application Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app) on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create application**, enter an application name such as `APIExample`. If you already have an application, select **Existing** and click **Next**.

### Step 2. Download the sample code

1. Select **No UI**, and go to [GitHub](https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/TRTC_Flutter/tree/master/TRTC-Simple-Demo) to download the SDK and demo source code.
2. Click **Next**.

### Step 3. Configure the project

1. If you are running a demo project, select **Testing**. Note the `SDKAppID` and secret key.

2. Open the file downloaded previously, find and open `/lib/debug/GenerateTestUserSig.dart`, and set the following parameters:
   >- `SDKAPPID`: A placeholder by default. Set it to the actual `SDKAppID`.
   >- `SECRETKEY`: A placeholder by default. Set it to the actual key.
3. Click **Next**.

>ï¼Ÿ
>- The method for generating `UserSig` described in this document involves configuring `SECRETKEY` in the client code. In this method, `SECRETKEY` may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is disclosed, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is only suitable for the local execution and debugging of TRTC-Simple-Demo**.
>- The best practice is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to your server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate `UserSig` during production?](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/35166).

### Step 4. Compile and run the demo

1. Execute `flutter pub get`.
2. Build and run the project.

#### Android

1. Execute `flutter run`.
2. Open the demo project with Android Studio (3.5 or later), and run the project.

#### iOS

1. Execute `cd ios`.
2. Execute `pod install`.
3. Open `/ios` in the source code directory with Xcode (11.0 or later). Compile and run the demo project.

#### Windows

1. Execute `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`.
2. Execute `flutter run -d windows`.

#### macOS

1. Execute `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop`.
2. Execute `cd macos`.
3. Execute `pod install`.
4. Execute `flutter run -d macos`.


## FAQs
### How do I view TRTC logs?
TRTC logs are compressed and encrypted by default (XLOG format). You can find them at the following paths:
- **iOS**: `Documents/log` of the application sandbox
- **Android**:
	- v6.7 or earlier: `/sdcard/log/tencent/liteav`
	- v6.8 or later: `/sdcard/Android/data/package name/files/log/tencent/liteav/`

### What should I do if videos show on Android but not on iOS?
Make sure that in `info.plist` of your project, the value of `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` is `YES`. 

### What should I do if the "Manifest merge failed" error occurs in Android Studio?
Open `/example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
    
1. Add `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` to `manifest`.
2. Add `tools:replace="android:label"` to `application`.
