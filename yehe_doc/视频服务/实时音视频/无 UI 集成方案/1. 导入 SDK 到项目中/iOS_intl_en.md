## Environment Requirements
- Xcode 9.0 or later 
- iPhone or iPad with iOS 9.0 or later
- A valid developer signature for your project

## Step 1. Import the SDK
You can use CocoaPods or download and import the SDK manually into your project.

### Method 1. Use CocoaPods
1. **Install CocoaPods.**
Enter the following command in a terminal window (you need to install Ruby on your Mac first):
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```
2. **Create a Podfile.**
Go to the directory of your project and enter the following command to create a Podfile in the directory.
```
pod init
```
3. **Edit the Podfile.**
Choose an appropriate edition according to your project needs and edit the Podfile:
  - **Option 1: Lite**
The installation package is the smallest but only supports two features: real-time communication (TRTC) and live player (TXLivePlayer). To choose this edition, edit the Podfile as follows:
```
 platform :ios, '8.0'
  
  target 'App' do
  pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC', :podspec => 'https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/pod/liteavsdkspec/TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC.podspec'
  end
```
  - **Option 2: Professional**
The installation package includes real-time communication (TRTC), live player (TXLivePlayer), RTMP streaming (TXLivePusher), VOD player (TXVodPlayer), short video recording and editing (UGSV) features. To choose this edition, edit the Podfile as follows:
```
 platform :ios, '8.0'
  
  target 'App' do
  pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_Professional', :podspec => 'https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/pod/liteavsdkspec/TXLiteAVSDK_Professional.podspec'
  end
```
4. **Update and install the SDK.**
 - Enter the following command in a terminal window to update the local repository file and install the SDK:
```
pod install
```
 - Or, run this command to update the local repository:
```
pod update
```
An XCWORKSPACE project file integrated with the TRTC SDK will be generated. Double-click to open it.

### Method 2. Download the SDK and import it manually
1. Download the [SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615) and decompress it locally.
2. Open your Xcode project, select the target you want to run, and click **Build Phases**.

3. Expand **Link Binary With Libraries** and click the **+** icon at the bottom to add dependent libraries.

4. Add the downloaded **TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC.Framework** (or **TXLiteAVSDK_Professional.Framework**) and its required dependencies **libc++.tbd**, **libresolv.tbd**, **Accelerate.framework**, **MetalKit.framework**, **MobileCoreServices.framework**, **SystemConfiguration.framework**, **ReplayKit.framework**, and **CoreTelephony.framework**.

5. Click **General**, expand **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**, and click the **+** icon at the bottom to add the dynamic libraries required by `TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC.framework`: **TXFFmpeg.xcframework** and **TXSoundTouch.xcframework**. Click **Embed & Sign**.

## Step 2. Configure app permissions
1. To use the audio/video features of the SDK, you need to grant the application mic and camera permissions. Add the two items below to `Info.plist` of your application. Their content is what users see in the mic and camera access pop-up windows.
- **Privacy - Microphone Usage Description**. Include a statement specifying why mic access is needed
- **Privacy - Camera Usage Description**. Include a statement specifying why camera access is needed

2. If you want the SDK to work when the app is in the background, select your project, under the **Capabilities** tab, set **Background Modes** to **ON**, and check **Audio, AirPlay, and Picture in Picture**.

## Step 3. Using the SDK in your project
After completing the first step of importing and the second step of granting device permissions, you can use the APIs provided by the SDK in your project.

### Using Objective-C or Swift APIs
There are two ways to use the SDK in Objective-C or Swift:
- **Import the module**: Import the SDK module in the files that will use the SDK APIs.
```
@import TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC;
```
- **Import the header file**: Import the header file in the files that will use the SDK APIs.
```
#import TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC/TRTCCloud.h
```

### Using C++ APIs (optional)
If your project imports the SDK through a cross-platform framework such as Qt or Electron, import the header files in the `TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC.framework/Headers/cpp_interface` directory:
```
#include TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC/cpp_interface/ITRTCCloud.h
```

>? For more information on how to use C++ APIs, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35131).
