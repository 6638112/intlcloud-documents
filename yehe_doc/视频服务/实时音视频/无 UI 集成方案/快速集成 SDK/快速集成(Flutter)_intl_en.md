## Integrating the SDK

The Flutter SDK has been published on [Pub](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_trtc_cloud). You can have the SDK downloaded and updated automatically by configuring `pubspec.yaml`.
1. Add the following dependency to `pubspec.yaml` of your project.
```
dependencies:
  tencent_trtc_cloud: latest version number
```
2. Obtain **camera** and **mic** permissions to enable the audio and video call features.
<dx-tabs>
::: iOS\s
1. Add requests for camera and mic permissions in `Info.plist`:
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Video calls are possible only with camera permission.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Audio calls are possible only with mic access.</string>
```
2. Add the field `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` and set the value to `Yes`.
:::
::: macOS\s
1. Add requests for camera and mic permissions in `Info.plist`:
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Video calls are possible only with camera permission.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Audio calls are possible only with mic access.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>The app needs your approval to access your gallery.</string>
```
2. Add `com.apple.security.network.client` and `com.apple.security.network.server` to `macos/Runner/*.entitlements`.

::: Android\s
1. Open `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` to `manifest`.
3. Add `tools:replace="android:label"` to `application`.
>? Without the above steps, the [Android Manifest merge failed](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39242) error will occur and the compilation will fail.
