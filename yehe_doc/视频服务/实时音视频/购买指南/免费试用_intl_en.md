## Free Trial
Starting from October 11, 2019, Tencent Cloud accounts that create applications for the first time in the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc) will get a 10,000-minute free trial, which can be used for [video calls](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39788), [audio calls](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39787), [interactive live video streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39786), and [interactive live audio streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39785).

Note:
- The free trial period lasts from the day of acquisition until the last day of the same month next year.
 For example, if you acquired a free trial on May 1, 2020, it would be valid from May 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021.
- The audio duration and the SD/HD/UHD video duration are **given the same weight** when it comes to deduction, meaning that your actual usage (in minutes) of TRTC services is deducted from the trial package.
- **Once the trial package is exhausted, the services will be suspended for your account**. This is to avoid cases where you overuse the trial package and incur costs without knowing. To continue using the services, you need to [purchase a package](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/trtc). After payment, the package will take effect in about 5 minutes, and TRTC will be activated automatically for your account.
- Once your trial package expires, the remaining minutes in the package will become invalid and cannot be retrieved.
