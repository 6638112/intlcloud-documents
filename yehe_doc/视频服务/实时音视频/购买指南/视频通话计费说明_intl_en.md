## Usage Calculation
Your usage of the video call service is the cumulative [video duration](#v_duration) and [audio duration](#s_duration) generated by all users in [TRTC rooms](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714).

>! A duration is calculated in seconds and monthly cumulative seconds are converted to minutes for billing. A duration of less than one minute is calculated as one minute.




<span id="v_duration"></span>
### Video duration
Video duration is the length of video streams received by users who subscribe to video streams after room entry. TRTC categorizes and bills video durations based on the **actual resolution of video received**.
Below is how video durations are categorized by resolution:

|Category|Resolution of the Received Video|
|-------|--------|
|SD| ≤ 640 × 480|
|HD|640 × 480 - 1280 × 720|
|UHD| >1280 × 720|

- If a user subscribes to video streams, then only the video duration, rather than both the audio and video durations, will be counted.
- If a user subscribes to multiple channels of video streams, TRTC will add up the video duration of each channel.
- The TRTC SDK does not set limits for the video resolution. You can [choose the video quality](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35153) that fits your needs.


<span id="s_duration"></span>
### Audio duration
In video calls, audio duration is the total length of users’ stays in TRTC rooms minus the period during which video data is received.
Suppose a user entered a TRTC room at 00:00 and left at 00:50. The details of the stay are as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b127abe248a205842a6216ccbd7c111e.png)
The segments in blue are counted into the audio duration, which is `the total length of stay − the period during which the video is received = 50 min − 15 min = 35 min`.


- Audio durations are counted only when users do not subscribe to video streams.
- Audio duration is calculated as long as a user does not subscribe to video streams in a room, regardless of whether streams are uploaded or not.
- In cases where a user enters and leaves a room multiple times, TRTC will add up the length of the user’s stays in the room.


<span id="Fixed_price"></span>
## Pricing

The prices of video calls are listed below:

|Billable Item|Unit Price (USD/1,000 Min)|
|---|---|
|Audio|0.99|
|SD|1.99|
|HD|3.99|
|UHD|14.99|

<span id="Billing_method)
## Billing Mode
TRTC supports two billing modes: **prepaid packages** (default) and **pay-as-you-go**. You will be switched to the pay-as-you-go mode automatically after your prepaid package is exhausted or expires. You cannot switch to the pay-as-you-go mode by yourself.




<span id="pre-payment"></span>
### Prepaid packages
TRTC offers universal audio and video packages, from which audio, SD video, HD video, and UHD video durations are deducted in the proportion of *1:1, 2:1, 4:1, and 15:1**, respectively. This means that if a HD video duration of 1 minute is generated, then 4 minutes will be deducted from a universal package.
Below are the prices of universal packages:

About universal packages:
- The validity period of a universal package lasts from the day of purchase until the last day of the same month next year.
 For example, if you purchased a package on May 1, 2020, it would be valid from May 1, 2020 to May 31, 2021.
- You can purchase multiple packages. A duration is deducted in real time from the package that applies and expires the fastest.
- A new package takes effect in about 5 minutes after payment. **If your account has a duration that is generated after 00:00 of the day of purchase and hasn’t been deducted, it will be deducted immediately from the newly purchased package.
- To avoid interrupting your active businesses, **TRTC will not suspend its services for your account when your package is exhausted or expires**. The duration not deducted from your package will be billed under the [pay-as-you-go](#post-payment) mode.
- Once a universal package expires, the remaining minutes in the package will become invalid and cannot be retrieved.


<span id="post-payment"></span>
### Pay-as-you-go
When you overuse your package, the extra duration will be billed under the pay-as-you-go mode based on the [list price](#Fixed_price).
You can choose to pay [daily](#daily) or [monthly](#monthly).


<span id="daily"></span>
#### Pay-as-you-go daily
Accounts that create their first [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) in the TRTC console on and after September 1, 2020 are charged daily by default under the pay-as-you-go mode. Fees for the day are deducted at 10:00 AM the next day.


<span id="monthly"></span>
#### Pay-as-you-go monthly
Accounts that created their first [application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37714) in the TRTC console on and before August 31, 2020 are charged monthly by default under the pay-as-you-go mode. Fees for the month are deducted within the first five days of the next month. For details, see [Bills](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/7432).
>!
>- You will be switched to the pay-as-you-go mode automatically after your prepaid package is exhausted or expires. You cannot switch to the pay-as-you-go mode by yourself.
>- You cannot change the billing cycle by yourself. If you wish to change the billing cycle from monthly to daily, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
>- If your account balance is insufficient for the deduction of the incurred fees, the overdue payment may cause other Tencent Cloud services to be suspended for your account too. For example, because on-cloud recording relies on **CSS** and **VOD**, your on-cloud recording task may fail due to the overdue payment.

## Billing Examples
>! The examples below use the list prices. You can [purchase a package](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/trtc) to reduce your expenses.

### Audio duration

Suppose user A, B, and C stayed in a TRTC room for 30 minutes, and none of them received video data throughout the process.
The **total cost** would be `the unit price of the audio duration x the total audio duration of all three users = 0.99 USD/1,000 min x (30 min + 30 min + 30 min) ÷ 1,000 = 0.0891 USD`.

### Video duration

Suppose user A and B stayed in a TRTC room for 45 minutes and received each other’s video data throughout the process. The resolutions of the videos they received would be as follows:

<table>
     <tr>
         <th style="text-align:center">Segment</th>  
         <th style="text-align:center">Resolution of Video A Received</th> 
         <th style="text-align:center">Resolution of Video B Received</th> 
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center" rowspan="1">First 30 min</td>   
         <td style="text-align:center">1280 × 720 (HD)</td>
         <td style="text-align:center">1920 × 1080 (UHD)</td>   
     </tr> 
     <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center" rowspan="1">Last 15 min</td>   
         <td style="text-align:center">640 × 360 (SD)</td> 
         <td style="text-align:center">640 × 360 (SD)</td>
     </tr> 
</table>

Analysis:
- A’s duration and expense:
  - A received HD video from B in the first 30 minutes and SD video in the last 15 minutes.
  - The cost incurred would be `the unit price of HD video × the HD video duration + the unit price of SD video × the SD video duration = 3.99 USD/1,000 min × (30 min ÷ 1,000) + 1.99 USD/1,000 min × (15 min ÷ 1,000) = 0.14955 USD`.
- B’s duration and expense:
  - B received UHD video from A in the first 30 minutes and SD video in the last 15 minutes.
  - The cost incurred would be `the unit price of UHD video × the UHD video duration + the unit price of SD video × the SD video duration = 14.99 USD/1,000 min × (30 min ÷ 1,000) + 1.99 USD/1,000 min × (15 min ÷ 1,000) = 0.47955 USD`.

The **total cost** of the TRTC room would be `A’s cost + B’s cost = 0.6291 USD`.

### Audio and video durations

Suppose user A and B stayed in a TRTC room for 45 minutes. A received B’s video data throughout the process, and B received A’s video data only in the first 30 minutes. The resolutions of the videos they received would be as follows:

<table>
     <tr>
         <th style="text-align:center">Segment</th>  
         <th style="text-align:center">Resolution of Video A Received</th> 
         <th style="text-align:center">Resolution of Video B Received</th> 
     </tr>
     <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center" rowspan="1">First 30 min</td>   
         <td style="text-align:center">1280 × 720 (HD)</td>
         <td style="text-align:center">1920 × 1080 (UHD)</td>   
     </tr> 
     <tr>
         <td style="text-align:center" rowspan="1">Last 15 min</td>   
         <td style="text-align:center">640 × 360 (SD)</td> 
         <td style="text-align:center">Audio only</td>
     </tr> 
</table>


Analysis:

- A’s duration and expense:
  - A received HD video from B in the first 30 minutes and SD video in the last 15 minutes.
  - The cost incurred would be `the unit price of HD video × the HD video duration + the unit price of SD video × the SD video duration = 3.99 USD/1,000 min × (30 min ÷ 1,000) + 1.99 USD/1,000 min × (15 min ÷ 1,000) = 0.14955 USD`.
- B’s duration and expense:
  - B received UHD video from A in the first 30 minutes and did not receive video in the last 15 minutes.
  - The cost incurred would be `the unit price of UHD video × the UHD video duration + the unit price of audio × the audio duration = 14.99 USD/1.000 min × (30 min ÷ 1,000) + 0.99 USD/1,000 min × (15 min ÷ 1,000) = 0.46455 USD`.

The **total cost** of the TRTC room would be `A's cost + B’s cost = 0.6141 USD`.
