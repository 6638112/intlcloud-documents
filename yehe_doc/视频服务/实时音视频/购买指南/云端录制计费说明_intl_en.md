## Usage Calculation Method

Tencent Cloud calculates an account’s on-cloud recording usage by adding up the **duration** of all recording files under the account. There are two types of recording durations: **video duration** and **audio duration**.

>!  Duration is calculated in seconds and daily cumulative seconds are converted to minutes for billing. A duration of less than one minute is calculated as one minute.


### Video duration
A video duration refers to the duration containing videos in a recording output file. Video durations are categorized by the following resolutions and billed accordingly.

|Video Type|Resolution|
|-------|--------|
|SD| ≤ 640 × 480|
|HD|640 × 480 - 1280 × 720|
|FHD| > 1280 × 720|


- If a duration contains both video and audio, it will be charged as a video duration.
- The resolutions of different durations in an output file may vary with the input resolutions. TRTC refreshes the resolution every five seconds and records the durations of different resolutions separately.


### Audio duration
An audio duration refers to the duration containing only audio in a recording output file.

## Billing Mode

## Billing Examples
>!
>- The examples below use list prices. However, if you have signed a contract with Tencent Cloud sales, the prices specified in the contract will be applied instead.
>- By default, the audio and video streams of each user in a TRTC room are recorded as a separate file. You can also use the [On-Cloud MixTranscoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34618) feature to record the videos of multiple users in one file, for which you will be charged additional fees. For details, see [On-Cloud MixTranscoding Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38929).

Suppose user A, B and C make a TRTC call for 10 minutes and the entire call is recorded. Below are the types and resolutions of the streams pushed.

|User|Stream Type|Resolution|Billable Item|
|---|---|---|---|
|A|Audio-only|None|Audio|
|B|Video+audio|640 × 360|SD|
|C|Video-only|1280 × 720|HD|

### Recording without stream mixing
If On-Cloud MixTranscoding is disabled, Tencent Cloud will generate three separate recording output files for A, B, and C, and the total recording fee for this call will be:
>A's recording fee + B's recording fee + C's recording fee = unit price of audio duration × A's audio duration + unit price of SD video duration × B's SD video duration + unit price of HD video duration × C's HD video duration = 0.499 USD/thousand minutes x 10 minutes/1,000 + 0.99 USD/thousand minutes × 10 minutes/1,000 + 1.99 USD/thousand minutes × 10 minutes/1,000 = 0.03479 USD.

### Recording after stream mixing

If On-Cloud MixTranscoding is enabled, the streams of A, B, and C will be mixed and recorded in one file, and the output video resolution will be 1280 × 720. The recording fee for this call will be:
> Unit price of HD video duration × HD video duration = 1.99 USD/thousand minutes × 10 minutes/1,000 = 0.0199 USD.

An additional fee will be charged for the use of On-Cloud MixTranscoding. For details, see [On-Cloud MixTranscoding Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38929).
