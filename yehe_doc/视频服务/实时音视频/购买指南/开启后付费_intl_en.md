This document describes how to enable pay-as-you-go for TRTC’s basic and value-added services.

## Basic Services
Basic services include [interactive live audio streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39785), [interactive live video streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39786), [audio call](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39787), and [video call](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39788). You can enable the pay-as-you-go mode for them if necessary.

#### Enabling pay-as-you-go via the application list

1. If you didn’t enable pay-as-you-go when creating your first application and now want TRTC to not suspend services for your account after your trial package is used up or expires, click **[Application Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app)** to open the application list.
2. Click **Application Info** in the **Operation** column.

### Method 2: automatic switch to pay-as-you-go
If you have purchased a general package, when the package is used up or expires, you will be **automatically switched** to the **pay-as-you-go** mode.

>! If you overuse a package for TRTC basic services, the extra duration will be billed at **pay-as-you-go rates**. **Once enabled, the pay-as-you-go mode cannot be disabled.**


## Value-Added Services
Value-added services are additional services TRTC offers on top of the four basic services and cannot be used separately. You will be charged additional fees for using the value-added services [on-cloud recording](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38385) and [On-Cloud MixTranscoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38929). As value-added services support only **daily pay-as-you-go**, you don’t need to manually enable the mode.
