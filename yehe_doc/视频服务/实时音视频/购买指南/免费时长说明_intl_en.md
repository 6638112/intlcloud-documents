## Free Package
Tencent Cloud offers all accounts that have activated TRTC a 10,000-minute free package per month.



A free package offsets durations in the following order:

Audio/video call and interactive live streaming:

1. Audio duration
2. HD video duration
3. FHD video duration
4. 2K video duration
5. 4K video duration

Others:

5. Audio duration of on-cloud recording
6. HD video duration of on-cloud recording
7. FHD video duration of on-cloud recording
8. 2K video duration of on-cloud recording
9. 4K video duration of on-cloud recording



You wonâ€™t be charged any fees if your monthly duration does not exceed 10,000 minutes. After you use up the 10,000-minute free package, you will be charged according to the billing rules.



Notes:

- A free package expires at the end of each month and unused minutes cannot be rolled over to the next month. You can view your remaining minutes in [Package Management](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/package) of the console.
- A free package offsets all durations, regardless of their categories, at a ratio of **1:1** in real time. That is, for 1 minute of audio duration or SD/HD/FHD/2K/4K duration consumed, 1 minute is subtracted from your free package.
