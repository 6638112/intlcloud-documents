## Usage Calculation Method

TRTC calculates your usage of the relayed transcoding service by adding up the **duration** of the streams produced through MCU On-Cloud MixTranscoding by all the applications in your Tencent Cloud account. Depending on the encoding methods and transcoding results, the duration is classified into [video duration](#m_video) and [audio duration](#m_voice).

>!  The duration is calculated in seconds and daily cumulative seconds are converted to minutes for billing. Duration shorter than one minute will be calculated as one minute.

<span id="m_video"></span>
### Video duration
A video duration refers to the duration containing video images in a transcoding result. Videos are categorized by resolution as follows and billed accordingly:

| Category   | Output Resolution                   |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| Standard definition (SD)  | 640×480 or lower        |
| High definition (HD)  | 640×480-1280×720       |
| Full high definition (FHD) | Higher than 1280×720     |

- If a stream in a transcoding result contains both video and audio, you will only pay for the video duration.
- A transcoded stream may contain video segments of different resolutions. TRTC checks the resolution at regular intervals (usually every 60 seconds) and updates its calculation when detecting a change in the resolution.

### Audio duration

An audio duration refers to the duration containing only audio in a transcoding result.

## Billing Examples
>- The below example uses list prices. If you have signed a Tencent Cloud contract, prices specified in the contract will apply.

You used the On-Cloud MixTranscoding service through the MCU cluster provided by TRTC on January 1, which produced 1920×1080 and 640×360 videos using the H.264 codec, each totaling 100 minutes, plus 100-minute audio using the audio codec.

**Analysis:**
- Video with a resolution of 1920×1080 falls under the FHD category and is therefore charged 0.00899 USD/min.
- Video with a resolution of 640×360 falls under the HD category and is therefore charged 0.00464286 USD/min.
- Audio is charged 0.000799 USD/min.

That means on January 2, the amount deducted from your payment account would be 0.00899 USD/min x 100 min + 0.00464286 USD/min x 100 min + 0.000799 USD/min x 100 min, which amounts to 2.16 USD.
