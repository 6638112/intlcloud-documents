Each Tencent Cloud account that has activated TRTC gets 10,000 free minutes every month.



The free minutes deduct your usage **at the following ratios**:

**Notes:**
- The free minutes expire at the end of each cycle and cannot be rolled over to the next cycle.


   For example, if you receive the free minutes on November 15, 2022, they would be valid from November 15, 2022 to December 14, 2022.


   You can view the validity of your free minutes in [Package Management](https://console.tencentcloud.com/trtc/package) of the TRTC console.

- You will incur additional fees only if your monthly usage exceeds 10,000 minutes.
