# Notes for Overdue Payment Processing

When the Tencent Cloud billing platform detects that your Tencent Cloud account balance is insufficient, it will send you reminders for payment. You have 24 hours to make the payment after your account becomes overdue. If you fail to do so, the TRTC service will be suspended. If you make the payment within 24 hours of payment overdue, your TRTC service will not be affected. Please kindly note that after the service is suspended, users will not be able to enter rooms.
