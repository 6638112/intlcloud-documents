In **Usage Statistics > On-Cloud Recording**, you can view your [usage of the on-cloud recording service by duration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/45176).

## Note
The data is updated every 5 minutes instead of in real time, so there may be a delay of 5-20 minutes in the display of statistics.

### Directions

1. Log in to the TRTC console, and select **Usage Statistics** > **[On-Cloud Recording](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/cloudrecord)** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the application whose usage details you want to view, and select a time range.



## Usage Details
Durations are calculated in seconds and rounded up to minutes. Therefore, the cumulative duration used for billing may differ slightly from your actual usage. For the actual billable amount, see the bills generated in [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/download).
