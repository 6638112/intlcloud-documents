In **Usage Statistics > On-Cloud Recording**, you can view your [usage of the on-cloud recording service by duration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38385). If you use live recording, which is charged based on the [peak number of recording channels](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/267/2818#.E7.9B.B4.E6.92.AD.E5.BD.95.E5.88.B6), you need to go to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/analysis/bill?tab=record) to view the usage details.

## Note
The data is updated every 5 minutes instead of in real time, so there may be a delay of 5-20 minutes in the display of statistics.

## Usage Details
Durations are calculated in seconds and rounded up to minutes. Therefore, the cumulative duration used for billing may differ slightly from your actual usage. For the actual billable amount, see the bills generated in [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/download).
