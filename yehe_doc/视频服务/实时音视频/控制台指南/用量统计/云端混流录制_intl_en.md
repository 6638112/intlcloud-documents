In **Usage Statistics > On-Cloud MixTranscoding**, you can view your [usage of the On-Cloud MixTranscoding service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/38929) provided by TRTC. If you use the [stream mix](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/37665) feature provided by CSS, you need to go to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/analysis/bill?tab=record) to view the usage details.

## Notes
The data is updated every 5 minutes instead of in real time, so there may be a delay of 5-20 minutes in the display of statistics.

## Directions
1. Log in to the TRTC console, and select **Usage Statistics** > **[On-Cloud MixTranscoding](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/cloudmcu)** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the target application and time period (taking bill-by-duration mode as an example).

## Usage Details

Durations are calculated in seconds and rounded up to minutes. Therefore, the cumulative duration used for billing may differ slightly from your actual usage. For the actual billable amount, see the bills generated in [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/download).
