The data is updated every 5 minutes instead of in real time, so there may be a delay of 5-20 minutes in the display of statistics.

## Usage Details

Durations are calculated in seconds and rounded up to minute. Therefore, the cumulative duration used for billing may differ slightly from your actual usage. For the actual billable amount, see the bills generated in [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/bill/download).
