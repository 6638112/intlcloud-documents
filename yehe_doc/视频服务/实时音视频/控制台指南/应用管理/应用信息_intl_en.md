## Relayed Live Streaming Info
In relayed live streaming, TRTC uses a relaying and transcoding cluster to convert its UDP audio/video streams into RTMP streams in the cloud, which are then pushed to the standard live streaming system and distributed through CDNs. You will need the information here to implement [CDN Relayed Live Streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35242).

## TRTC Service Status
This section shows the status of TRTC basic and value-added services, which may be **Normal** or **Disabled**.
- **Normal:**
If the status is normal, you have access to both the basic and value-added services. To avoid service suspension, please purchase [new packages](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/trtc) in a timely manner or, if you have [enabled pay-as-you-go](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41979), make sure that your [account](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense) has sufficient balance.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/a8c76a18b99137e9b0df77a823438c73.png)
- **Disabled:**
If the status is disabled, you have access to neither the basic nor value-added services. This may involve one of three circumstances.
	1. If you havenâ€™t enabled pay-as-you-go, the services may have been suspended automatically for your account after your trial package is used up or expires. You can [purchase a package](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/trtc) or [enable pay-as-you-go](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41979) to resume the services.
	2. If you have enabled pay-as-you-go, the service suspension may be a result of overdue payments in your account. The services will be resumed once you [make the payment](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/overview).
	3. You may have manually disabled an application, in which case you can click **Enable Application** to resume the services.
