## Relayed Live Streaming Info
In relayed live streaming, TRTC uses relayed transcoding clusters to convert its UDP audio/video streams into RTMP streams in the cloud, which are then pushed to the standard CSS system and distributed through CDN. You will need the information here to implement [CDN Relayed Live Streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35242).
