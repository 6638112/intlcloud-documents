TRTC offers a monitoring dashboard for developers to monitor call quality. You can view call details and learn about the call status of users in the monitoring dashboard.

## Viewing Call List

Log in to the TRTC console, and click **[Monitoring Dashboard](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/monitor)** to view the call details of all rooms under the logged-in account. By default, the call list displays the calls made under the last created application during the day of query. The most recent calls appear at the top of the list.

The information displayed in the call list includes:

| Item             | Description                                                         |

| Room Duration       | The time between the entry of the first user and exit of the last user. If a call is in progress, the time from the entry of the first user to when the query takes place is displayed. |
| Joined Users         | The total number of users who have entered the room                                     |
