## Demonstration
You can [download](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35076) and install the demo we provide to try out TRTC’s audio chat room features, including seat management, low-latency audio interaction, text chat, etc.

To quickly implement the video chat room feature, you can modify the demo we provide and adapt it to your needs. You can also use the `TRTCVoiceRoom` component and customize your own UI.

[](id:DemoUI)
## Using the Demo UI

[](id:ui.step1)
### Step 1. Create an application.
1. Log in to the TRTC console and select **Development Assistance** > **[Demo Quick Run](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/quickstart)**.
2. Enter an application name, e.g. `TestVoiceRoom`, and click **Create**.

>?The audio chat room feature uses two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud, namely [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047). When you activate TRTC, IM will be activated automatically. IM is a value-added service. See [Value-added Service Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) for its billing details.



[](id:ui.step2)
### Step 2. Download the SDK and demo source code.
1. Download the SDK and demo source code for your platform.
2. Click **Next**.

[](id:ui.step3)
### Step 3. Configure demo project files.
1. In the **Modify Configuration** step, select the platform in line with the source package downloaded.
2. Find and open the `iOS/TRTCScenesDemo/TXLiteAVDemo/Debug/GenerateTestUserSig.h` file.
3. Set parameters in `GenerateTestUserSig.h` as follows.
- SDKAPPID: 0 by default. Set it to the actual `SDKAppID`.
- SECRETKEY: an empty string by default. Set it to the actual key.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87dc814a675692e76145d76aab91b414.png)
4. Click **Next** to complete the creation.
5. After compilation, click **Return to Overview Page**.

>!The method for generating `UserSig` described in this document involves configuring `SECRETKEY` in client code. In this method, `SECRETKEY` may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is leaked, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is only suitable for the local execution and debugging of the demo**.
>The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate UserSig on the server?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).

[](id:ui.step4)
### Step 4. Run the demo.
Use Xcode (version 11.0 or above) to open the `iOS/TRTCScenesDemo/TXLiteAVDemo.xcworkspace` project and click **Run** to start debugging.

[](id:ui.step5)
### Step 5. Modify the demo source code.
The `TRTCVoiceRoomDemo` folder in the source code contains two subfolders: `ui` and `model`. In the `ui` subfolder are UI code and UI-related logic. The table below lists the Swift files (folders) and UI views they represent. You can refer to it when making UI changes.

| File or Folder | Use |
|:-------:|:--------|
|TRTCVoiceRoomEnteryController| The initialization method of all `ViewControllers`. You can use the instance to quickly get a `ViewController` object. |
| NetworkRoomManager | Logic related to backend interactions |
| TRTCCreateVoiceRoomViewController | Logic for the room creation view |
| TRTCVoiceRoomListViewController | Logic for the room list view |
| TRTCVoiceRoomViewController | Logic for the main room views for anchors and viewers |

Each `TRTC'XXXX'ViewController` folder contains `ViewController`, `RootView`, and `ViewModel`, whose use is described below.

| File | Use |
|:-------:|:--------|
| ViewController | Page controller, which is responsible for routing pages and binding `RootView` and `ViweModel` |
| RootView | Layout of all views |
| ViewModel | View controller, which is responsible for responding to user interactions and returning response status |

[](id:model)
## Implementing A Custom UI
The `TRTCVoiceRoomDemo` folder in the [source code](https://github.com/tencentyun/TRTCSDK/tree/master/iOS/TRTCScenesDemo/TXLiteAVDemo/TRTCVoiceRoomDemo) contains two subfolders: `ui` and `model`. In the `model` subfolder is the reusable open-source component `TRTCVoiceRoom`. You can find the component’s APIs in `TRTCVoiceRoom.swift` and use them to customize your own UI.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/319beb14d72a43120e102380278aa1da.png)


[](id:model.step1)
### Step 1. Integrate the SDKs.
The audio chat room component `TRTCVoiceRoom` depends on the TRTC SDK and IM SDK. Follow the steps below to integrate the two SDKs into your project.

**Method 1: adding dependencies via CocoaPods**
```
pod 'TXIMSDK_iOS'
pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC'
```
>?You can view the latest version numbers of the two SDKs by visiting their GitHub pages at [TRTC](https://github.com/tencentyun/TRTCSDK) and [IM](https://github.com/tencentyun/TIMSDK).

**Method 2: adding dependencies through local files**
If your access to the CocoaPods repository is slow, you can download the ZIP packages of the SDKs and manually integrate them into your project as instructed in the documents below.

| SDK | Download Page | Integration Guide |
|---------|---------|---------|
| TRTC SDK | [Download](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615) | [Integration document](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35093) |
| IM SDK | [Download](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996) | [Integration document](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34306) |

[](id:model.step2)
### Step 2. Configure permission requests.
Configure camera and mic permission requests by adding `Privacy > Camera Usage Description` and `Privacy > Microphone Usage Description` in `info.plist`.

[](id:model.step3)
### Step 3. Import the `TRTCVoiceRoom` component.
Copy all files in `iOS/TRTCScenesDemo/TXLiteAVDemo/TRTCVoiceRoomDemo/model` to your project.

<span id="model.step4"></span>
### Step 4. Create a `TRTCVoiceRoom` instance and log in.
1. Call the `sharedInstance` class method of `TRTCVoiceRoomImp` to create an instance that complies with `TRTCVoiceRoom`’s protocol, or call the `shared` class method to get a `TRTCVoiceRoomImp` instance. There is no difference between the two methods with respect to API usage.
2. Call the `setDelegate` function to register event callbacks of the component.
3. Call the `login` function to log in to the component. Set the key parameters as described below.
<table>    
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Note</th></tr><tr>
<td>sdkAppId</td>
<td>You can view the `SDKAppID` of your application in the <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app">TRTC console</a>.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>userId</td>
<td>ID of the current user, which is a string that can contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>userSig</td>
<td>Tencent Cloud's proprietary security signature. To obtain one, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166">UserSig</a>.</td>
</tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>callback</td>
<td>Login callback. The code is 0 if login is successful.</td>
</tr></table>

```
// Swift sample
// The class responsible for business logic in your code
class YourController {
    // Calculate attributes to get a singleton object.
    var voiceRoom: TRTCVoiceRoomImp {
        return TRTCVoiceRoomImp.shared()
    }
    
    // Other code logic
    ......
}
// Set the `voiceroom` delegate.
self.vocieRoom. setDelegate(delegate: voiceRoomDelegate)

// Below is the calling method. We recommend you use `weak self` in the closure to prevent circular references. The `weak self` part is not included in the sample code below.
self.vocieRoom.login(sdkAppId: sdkAppID, userId: userId, userSig: userSig) { [weak self] (code, message) in
    guard let `self` = self else { return }
    // Your callback business logic        
}
```

[](id:model.step5)
### Step 5. Start streaming as an anchor.
1. After performing [step 4](#model.step4) to log in, call `setSelfProfile` to set your nickname and profile photo as an anchor.
2. Call `createRoom` to create an audio chat room and pass in room-related parameters such as room ID, whether to request your consent for viewers to speak , and the number of seats.
3. After creating the room, call `enterSeat` to take a seat.
4. You will receive an `onSeatListChange` notification about seat change from the component. Update the change to the UI.
5. You will also receive an `onAnchorEnterSeat` notification about the occupation of a seat, and mic capturing will be enabled automatically.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/256ebe5ce1426b3f175c8c8b68095d5b.png)

Sample code:

```swift
// 1. Set your nickname and profile photo as an anchor.
self.voiceRoom.setSelfProfile(userName: userName, avatarUrl: avatarURL) { (code, message) in
    // Result callback           
}



// 2. Create a room as an anchor.
let param = VoiceRoomParam.init()
param.roomName = "Room ID"
param.needRequest = true // Whether your consent is required for viewers to speak.
param.coverUrl = "Cover URL"
param.seatCount = 7 // Number of room seats. In this example, the number is 7. 6 seats remain after you take one.
param.seatInfoList = []
for _ in 0..<param.seatCount {
    let seatInfo = VoiceRoomSeatInfo.init()
    param.seatInfoList.append(seatInfo)
}
self.voiceRoom.createRoom(roomID: yourRoomID, roomParam: param) { (code, message) in
    guard code == 0 else { reutrn }
    // Take a seat after successfully creating a room.
    self.voiceRoom.enterSeat(seatIndex: 0) { [weak self] (code, message) in
        guard let `self` = self else { return }
        if code == 0 {
            // Seat taken.
        } else {
            // Failed to take a seat.
        }
    }
}



// 3. After taking a seat, you receive an `onSeatListChange` notification.
func onSeatListChange(seatInfoList: [VoiceRoomSeatInfo]) {
    // Refresh your seat list.
}



// 4. You receive an `onAnchorEnterSeat` notification.
func onAnchorEnterSeat(index: Int, user: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    // Handle the anchor mic-on event.
}
```

[](id:model.step6)
### Step 6. Play as a viewer.
1. After performing [step 4](#model.step4) to log in, you can call `setSelfProfile` to set your nickname and profile photo as a viewer.
2. Get the latest audio chat room list from the backend.
 >?The audio chat room list in the demo is for demonstration only. The logic of audio chat room lists varies significantly. Tencent Cloud does not provide list management services for the time being. Please manage the list by yourself.
3. Call `getRoomInfoList` to get short descriptions of the rooms, which are provided by anchors when they call `createRoom` to create the rooms.
 >!If your audio chat room list already displays enough room information, you can skip the step of calling `getRoomInfoList`.
4. Select an audio chat room, call `enterRoom`, and pass in the room ID to enter the room.
5. After entry, you will receive an `onRoomInfoChange` notification about room change from the component. Note the information, including the room name displayed on the UI, whether anchor’s consent is required for viewers to speak, etc., and make changes accordingly.
6. You will receive an `onSeatListChange` notification about the seat change from the component. Update the change to the UI.
7. You will also receive an `onAnchorEnterSeat` notification about the seating of the anchor.


![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/33432f97eb632fbb9710a59cba9e4469.png)


```
// 1. Set your nickname and profile photo as a viewer.
self.voiceRoom.setSelfProfile(userName: userName, avatarUrl: avatarURL) { (code, message) in
    // Result callback           
}

// 2. Get the room list from the backend. Suppose it is `roomList`.
let roomList: [Int] = getRoomIDList() // The function you use to get the list of room IDs

// 3. Call `getRoomInfoList` to get the details of the rooms.
self.voiceRoom.getRoomInfoList(roomIdList: roomIdsInt) { (code, message, roomInfos: [VoiceRoomInfo]) in
    // Get the result. Refresh the UI.
}

// 4. Select an audio chat room, and pass in the `roomId` to enter it.
self.voiceRoom.enterRoom(roomID: roomInfo.roomID) { (code, message) in
    // Callback of the room entry result
    if code == 0 {
       // Entered room successfully.
    }
}

// 5. After entering the room, you receive an `onRoomInfoChange` notification.
func onRoomInfoChange(roomInfo: VoiceRoomInfo) {
    // Update the room name and other information
}

// 6. After entering the room, you receive an `onSeatListChange` notification.
func onSeatListChange(seatInfoList: [VoiceRoomSeatInfo]) {
    // Refresh the seat list.
}

// 7. You receive an `onAnchorEnterSeat` notification.
func onAnchorEnterSeat(index: Int, user: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    // Handle the mic-on event.
}
```

<span id="model.step7"></span>
### Step 7. Manage seats.

#### Anchor
1. An anchor can place a viewer in a seat by passing the `userId` of the viewer and the seat number in `pickSeat`. All members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onAnchorEnterSeat` notifications.
2. An anchor can remove a user from a seat by passing the seat number in `kickSeat`. All members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onAnchorLeaveSeat` notifications.
3. An anchor can mute or unmute a viewer by passing the number of the seat occupied by the viewer in `muteSeat`. All members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onSeatMute` notifications.
4. An anchor can block or unblock a seat by passing the seat number in `closeSeat`. Viewers cannot take a blocked seat, and all members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onSeatClose` notifications.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/367a0c670d2f9899d0b311ed1f322ea3.png)
#### Viewer
1. A viewer can take a seat by passing the seat number in `enterSeat`. All members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onAnchorEnterSeat` notifications.
2. A viewer can leave a seat by calling `leaveSeat`. All members in the room will receive the `onSeatListChange` and `onAnchorLeaveSeat` notifications.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8d385dd387b6255b8512dbff5829e88a.png)

After a seat operation, the order in which different notifications are sent is: callbacks > `onSeatListChange` > independent events such as `onAnchorEnterSeat`.

```Swift
// Case 1: the anchor places a viewer in seat 1.
self.voiceRoom.pickSeat(seatIndex: 1, userId: "123") { (code, message) in
    // Result callback
}

// 3. The anchor receives an `onSeatListChange` callback, and refreshes the seat list.
func onSeatListChange(seatInfoList: [VoiceRoomSeatInfo]) {
    // Refresh the seat list
}

// 4. The anchor receives a notification about the change of a specific seat, which can be used to determine whether the viewer has taken the seat.
func onAnchorEnterSeat(index: Int, user: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    // Handle the mic-on event.
}
```

```Swift
// Case 2: a viewer takes seat 2.
voiceRoom.enterSeat(seatIndex: 2) { (code, message) in
    // Callback of the seat taking result
}

// 3. The viewer receives a `onSeatListChange` callback and refreshes the seat list.
func onSeatListChange(seatInfoList: [VoiceRoomSeatInfo]) {
    // Refresh the seat list
}

// 4. The viewer receives a notification about the change of a specific seat and, depending on whether the seat is the one he or she attempted to take, determines the next step.
func onAnchorEnterSeat(index: Int, user: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    // Handle the mic-on event.
}
```

[](id:model.step8)
### Step 8. Use signaling for invitations.
In [seat management](#model.step7), viewers can take and leave seats without the anchor’s permission, and the anchor can place viewers in seats without the viewers’ consent.
If you want viewers and anchors to obtain each other’s consent before performing the above actions in your app, you can use invitation signaling.
#### Viewer requesting to take seat
1. A viewer calls `sendInvitation` and passes in information including the anchor’s `userId` and custom command words. The function will return an `inviteId`, which should be noted.
2. The anchor receives an `onReceiveNewInvitation` notification, and a window pops up on the UI asking the anchor whether to approve the request.
3. The anchor approves the request, calls `acceptInvitation` and passes in the `inviteId`.
4. The viewer receives an `onInviteeAccepted` notification and calls `enterSeat` to take a seat.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5ccdb15f63efa127aa883ca6a7bcd80d.png)

```
// Viewer
// 1. Call `sendInvitation` to request to take seat 1.
let inviteId = self.voiceRoom.sendInvitation(cmd: "ENTER_SEAT", userId: ownerUserId, content: "1") { (code, message) in
    // Callback of the request sending result
}
// 4. Take the seat after receiving approval from the anchor.
func onInviteeAccepted(identifier: String, invitee: String) {
    if identifier == selfID {
        self.voiceRoom.enterSeat(seatIndex: ) { (code, message) in
            // Callback of the seat taking result
        }
    }
}

// Anchor
// 2. Receive the request.
func onReceiveNewInvitation(identifier: String, inviter: String, cmd: String, content: String) {
    if cmd == "ENTER_SEAT" {
        // 3. Approve the request.
        self.voiceRoom.acceptInvitation(identifier: identifier, callback: nil)
    }
}
```
#### Anchor inviting viewer to seat
1. The anchor calls `sendInvitation` and passes in information including the viewer’s `userId` and custom command words. The function will return an `inviteId`, which should be noted.
2. The viewer receives an `onReceiveNewInvitation` notification, and a window pops up asking the viewer whether to agree to take the seat.
3. The viewer agrees, calls `acceptInvitation`, and passes in the `inviteId`.
4. The anchor receives an `onInviteeAccepted` notification and calls `pickSeat` to put the viewer in the seat.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5515f49d6e30410e12cd828b75a8db0b.png)


```
// Anchor
// 1. Call `sendInvitation` to request to place viewer `123` in seat 2.
let inviteId = self.voiceRoom.sendInvitation(cmd: "PICK_SEAT", userId: ownerUserId, content: "2") { (code, message) in
    // Callback of the request sending result
}

// 4. Seat the viewer upon receiving the viewer’s approval.
func onInviteeAccepted(identifier: String, invitee: String) {
    if identifier == selfID {
        self.voiceRoom.pickSeat(seatIndex: ) { (code, message) in
            // Callback of the seat taking result
        }
    }
}

// Viewer
// 2. Receive the request.
func onReceiveNewInvitation(identifier: String, inviter: String, cmd: String, content: String) {
    if cmd == "PICK_SEAT" {
        // 3. Approve the request.
        self.voiceRoom.acceptInvitation(identifier: identifier, callback: nil)
    }
}
```

[](id:model.step9)
### Step 9. Enable text chat and on-screen comments.
- Call `sendRoomTextMsg` to send common text messages. All anchors and viewers in the room will receive the `onRecvRoomTextMsg` callback.
IM has its default content moderation rules. Text messages that contain blocked terms will not be forwarded by the cloud.

```Swift
// Sender: send text messages
self.voiceRoom.sendRoomTextMsg(message: message) { (code, message) in
         
}
// Recipient: listen for text messages
func onRecvRoomTextMsg(message: String, userInfo: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    // Handling of the messages received        
}
```
- Call `sendRoomCustomMsg` to send custom (signaling) messages. All anchors and viewers in the room will receive the `onRecvRoomCustomMsg` callback.
 Custom messages are often used to transfer custom signals, e.g., sending and broadcasting likes.
```swift
// Sender: customize CMD to distinguish on-screen comments and likes
// E.g., use "CMD_DANMU" to indicate on-screen comments and "CMD_LIKE" to indicate likes.
self.vocieRoom.sendRoomCustomMsg(cmd: “CMD_DANMU”, message: "hello world", callback: nil)
self.voiceRoom.sendRoomCustomMsg(cmd: "CMD_LIKE", message: "", callback: nil)
// Recipient: listen for custom messages
func onRecvRoomCustomMsg(cmd: String, message: String, userInfo: VoiceRoomUserInfo) {
    if cmd == "CMD_DANMU" {
        // Receive an on-screen comment.
    }
    if cmd == "CMD_LIKE" {
        // Receive a like.
    }
}
```
