This document analyzes TRTC’s performance in terms of audio/video quality, latency, smoothness, stability, CPU usage, memory usage, battery consumption, heating, and other key indicators in tests under **normal** and **poor** network conditions and in **different application scenarios** (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.).

## Performance Under Normal and Poor Network Conditions

### Scenario

Video call, interactive live streaming, and audio call

### Parameter configuration
- **Video call:**
<table><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>Resolution</td><td>368 x 640</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bitrate</td><td>400 Kbps</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frame rate</td><td>15</td>
</tr></table>

- **Interactive live streaming:**
<table><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Value</th></tr>
<tr><td>Resolution</td><td>720 x 1280</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bitrate</td><td>1200 Kbps</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Frame rate</td><td>15</td>

### Poor network tolerance test
The TRTC SDK was tested for its tolerance to different bad network conditions.

### Audio MOS under poor network conditions
TRTC can deliver relatively high-quality audio and low latency under poor network conditions.
The table below lists TRTC’s performance and mean opinion score (MOS) under different poor network conditions.

## Client SDK Performance

### Tested devices
|  Device  |  Processor |   Memory  |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---- |
| Android device 1 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 - 8 cores | 6 GB   |
| Android device 2 | Kirin 980 - 8 cores | 8 GB   |
| iOS device 1     | Apple A8 - 2 cores      | 3 GB   |
| iOS device 2     | Apple A13 - 6 cores     | 4 GB   |

### Parameter configuration

| Parameter | Value |
| ------ | ------- |
| Resolution | 240 x 320 |
| Bitrate   | 100 Kbps |
| Frame rate   | 15      |

### Test scheme

- **Scenario**: one-to-one, one-to-two, one-to-four, one-to-eight
- **Duration**: 30 min for each scenario
- **Method**: a Linux robot is used to simulate streaming in one-to-many scenarios. Each device is tested independently.

### Test result

The TRTC SDK performs well in terms of CPU usage, memory usage, heating, and battery consumption. It uses a small amount of hardware resources but provides quality audio/video services.

</tr><tr>
<td>MOS</td>
<td>An important measure of the audio quality of telecommunication systems. MOS is generated by Spirent Nomad using the <a href="#POLQA">POLQA</a> standard. The higher the score, the higher the audio quality.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>End-to-end latency</td>
<td>The time from when audio is captured at the sender end to when it is played back at the recipient end</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Poor network tolerance test</td>
<td>Spirent Nomad is used to score the SDK under different poor network conditions using the <a href="#POLQA">POLQA</a> standard. Foreman video sequences are used to send data, and frame intervals are monitored at the recipient end. Data is collected at 30 points over a course of 10 min or longer. If there are <strong>perceptible abnormalities of 3 min at more than 3 data points</strong>, or <strong>the SDK is unavailable for a relatively long period of time</strong>, the SDK is considered intolerant of the network conditions.</td>
