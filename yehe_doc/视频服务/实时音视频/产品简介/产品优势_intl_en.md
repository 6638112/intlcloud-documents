### Low latency
TRTC offers reliable and secure network connection across the globe. It uses Tencent Cloudâ€™s self-developed multi-level addressing algorithm and can connect to nodes across the entire network. Abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers allow it to maintain **an average end-to-end latency of below 300 ms** across different countries and regions.

### Low stutter rate
TRTC reduces stutter through intelligent QoS control and optimized encoding. It guarantees high-quality, smooth, and stable audio/video communication even under poor network conditions (**packet loss over 80%** and **network jitter over 1,000 ms**).

### High video/audio quality
TRTC supports **720p and 1080p** video and allows video calls even under a packet loss rate of 70%. It supports **48 kHz** audio and uses the industry-leading 3A technologies of Tencent Ethereal Audio Lab to remove echo and howling. End-to-end 192 Kbps bitrate and dual channels ensure a clear and immersive audio interaction experience.
