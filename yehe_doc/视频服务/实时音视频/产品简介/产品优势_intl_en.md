### Low Latency
TRTC offers a highly connected, reliable, and secure network across the globe. Leveraging our proprietary multi-addressing algorithms, TRTC has the ability to stream users' audio/video data to optimal nodes across the entire network. With abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers, it can ensure **an average end-to-end latency of below 300 ms** between countries/regions.

### Low Lag
TRTC reduces lags through intelligent QoS and optimized encoding, and is resilient against **a packet loss rate of over 40%** and **network jitter of over 1,000 ms**. Even with poor network condition, it can ensure a high-quality and stable audio/video communication.

### High Quality
**TRTC supports 720p and 1080p HD video** and enables you to have smooth video calls even at a 50% packet loss rate. **It also supports 48 kHz high-quality audio** and enables you to make clear audio calls even at a 60% packet loss rate. In addition, leveraging its industry-leading 3A processing technologies (i.e., acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), active noise suppression, (ANS), and automatic gain control (AGC)), it eliminates echoes and howling, rendering a lossless audio quality comparable to that of CDs.

### Compatibility with Multiple Platforms
**Implementing authentic cross-platform compatibility in the industry, TRTC is perfectly compatible with over 5,000 device models.** It provides client SDKs and Tencent Cloud APIs for mobile devices and desktops to make it easy for users to access the TRTC service on WeChat, QQ, WeChat Work, WeChat Mini Program, and webpage.
