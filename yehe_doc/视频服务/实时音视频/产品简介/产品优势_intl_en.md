### Low-Threshold Quick Integration
You can run the TRTC demo with merely two lines of code, integrate the general capabilities of TRTC with ten lines of code, and build a low-latency, low-lag, and high-quality real-time audio/video interactive product from scratch within 1 minute at the soonest. For detailed directions, please see [Quick Demo Run](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35086) and [Quick SDK Integration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35092).

### Scenario-based Custom Components
TRTC provides a rich set of scenario-based custom components to help you quickly implement various features in the simplest way, such as voice chat, conferencing, interactive live streaming, and interactive teaching. For detailed directions, please see [Use Cases](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/36065).

### Low Latency
TRTC offers a highly connected, reliable, and secure network across the globe. Leveraging our proprietary multi-addressing algorithms, TRTC has the ability to stream users' audio/video data to optimal nodes across the entire network. With abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers, it can ensure **an average end-to-end latency of below 300 ms** between countries/regions.

### Low Lag
TRTC reduces lags through intelligent QoS and optimized encoding, and is resilient against **a packet loss rate of over 80%** and **network jitter of over 1,000 ms**. Even with poor network condition, it can ensure a high-quality and stable audio/video communication.

### High Quality
**TRTC supports 720p and 1080p HD video** and enables you to have smooth video calls even at a 70% packet loss rate. **It also supports 128 kHz high-quality audio** and enables you to make clear audio calls even at a 80% packet loss rate. In addition, leveraging its industry-leading 3A processing technologies (i.e., acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), active noise suppression (ANS), and automatic gain control (AGC)), it eliminates echoes and howling, rendering a lossless audio quality comparable to that of CDs.
