### Low Costs
TRTC offers cost-effective fundamental audio/video services that enable you to build a low-latency, low-lag, and high-quality real-time audio/video interactive product from scratch within 30 minutes at the soonest, with only a small amount of labor required.

### Low Latency
TRTC provides network connection channels featuring high connectivity, reliability, and security with global coverage. It leverages Tencent Cloud's proprietary multi-layer optimal addressing algorithms to implement scheduling over the entire network. Based on the rich reserved high bandwidth resources and global deployment of nodes, **it guarantees an average end-to-end latency in international linkage of below 300 ms.**

### Low Lag
TRTC reduces the lagging rate based on intelligent network quality control and encoding optimization. In actual use, **its packet loss prevention rate is over 40%**, and **its network jitter prevention is over 1,000 ms**. It guarantees smooth and stable audio/video communication of high quality even in weak network environments.

### High Quality
**TRTC supports 720p and 1080p HD video** and enables you to have smooth video calls even at a 50% packet loss rate. **It also supports 48 kHz high-quality audio** and enables you to make clear audio calls even at a 60% packet loss rate. In addition, leveraging its industry-leading 3A processing technologies (i.e., acoustic echo cancellation (AEC), active noise suppression, (ANS), and automatic gain control (AGC)), it eliminates echoes and howling, rendering a lossless audio quality comparable to that of CDs.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Implementing authentic cross-platform compatibility in the industry, TRTC is perfectly compatible with over 5,000 device models.** It provides client SDKs and TencentCloud APIs for mobile devices and desktops to make it easy for users to access the TRTC service on WeChat, QQ, WeChat Work, WeChat Mini Program, and webpage.
