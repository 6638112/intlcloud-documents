### Cross-platform global interconnection
**TRTC is a cross-platform solution compatible with more than 5,000 device models.** It provides client SDKs and TencentCloud APIs for mobile and desktop platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web. End users can also use its services via the QQ, and WeCom.

### Easy and quick integration
You can run the TRTC demo and integrate basic TRTC features into your project with simple code. In as short as 1 minute, you can build from scratch a real-time audio/video communication product featuring low latency, low stutter rate, and high-quality. For detailed directions, please see [Quick Demo Start](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35086) and [SDK Quick Integration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35092).

### Scenario-specific components
TRTC provides a rich set of scenario-specific components to help you quickly and easily implement different features, including audio chat, conferencing, interactive live streaming, and interactive teaching. For detailed directions, please see [Scenario-specific Practice](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/36062).

### Low latency
TRTC offers reliable and secure network connection across the globe. It uses Tencent Cloudâ€™s proprietary multi-level addressing algorithm and can connect to nodes across the entire network. Abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers allow it to keep the **average global end-to-end latency below 300 ms**.

### Low stutter rate
TRTC reduces stutter through intelligent QoS control and encoding optimization. It can ensure high-quality, smooth, and stable audio/video communication even under poor network conditions (**packet loss over 80%** and **network jitter over 1,000 ms**).

### High quality
TRTC allows **720p and 1080p** video calls and guarantees smooth calling experience at 70% packet loss. It allows **48 kHz audio calls at a bitrate of 128 Kbps** and guarantees smooth calling experience at 80% packet loss. Furthermore, it leverages industry-leading 3A (i.e., AEC, ANS, and AGC) processing technologies to remove echo and prevent howling, delivering a lossless audio quality comparable to that of CDs.
