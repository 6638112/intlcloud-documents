### Cross-platform global connection
**TRTC is a cross-platform solution compatible with more than 5,000 device models.** It provides client SDKs and Tencent Cloud APIs for mobile and desktop platforms including iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and web.
### Easy and quick integration
You can run a TRTC demo and integrate basic TRTC features into your project with a few lines of simple code. In as little as 1 minute, you can build a real-time audio/video communication product from scratch featuring low latency, low stutter rate, and high-quality. For detailed directions, see [Quick Demo Start](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35086) and [SDK Quick Integration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35092).

### Scenario-specific components
TRTC provides a rich set of components to help you quickly implement features such as audio chat, conferencing, interactive live streaming, and interactive teaching. For detailed directions, see [Building a Demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/46332).

### Low latency
TRTC offers reliable and secure network connection across the globe. It uses Tencent Cloudâ€™s self-developed multi-level addressing algorithm and can connect to nodes across the entire network. Abundant high-bandwidth resources and globally-distributed edge servers allow it to maintain an **average global end-to-end latency below 300 ms**.

### Low stutter rate
TRTC reduces stutter through intelligent QoS control and encoding optimization. It can ensure high-quality, smooth, and stable audio/video communication even under poor network conditions (**packet loss over 80%** and **network jitter over 1,000 ms**).

### High quality
TRTC enables **720p and 1080p** video calls and guarantees stable calls even at 70% packet loss. It allows **48 kHz audio calls at a bitrate of 128 Kbps** at up to 80% packet loss. Furthermore, it leverages industry-leading 3A (i.e., AEC, ANS, and AGC) processing technologies to remove echo and prevent howling, delivering lossless audio comparable to CD quality.
