We offer three types of media SDK (RT-Cube) licenses: **live stream publishing**, **UGSV**, and **video playback**. For their billing details, see [Billing Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/50553). After purchasing a license, you can bind it in the [TRTC console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/trtc/license), the [CSS console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/live/license), or the [VOD console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/vod/license) to activate a new capability or extend the validity of an existing capability. The capabilities different licenses can activate are as follows:

| License | Capabilities            |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Live stream publishing     | Live stream publishing + Video playback |
| UGSV       | UGSV (Lite/Standard) + Video playback |
| Video playback | Video playback |

>! Starting from v10.1, the live stream publishing license and UGSV license can also activate the video playback capability. This means you can now use the video playback capability of the Player SDK with a live stream publishing license or UGSV license.

**This document uses the live stream publishing license as an example** to show you how to activate a capability using a trial or official license, and how to extend the validity of an existing capability.
