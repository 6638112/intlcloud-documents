Log in to the [TRTC Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/rav) and click the name of the application whose monitoring data you want to view to enter the application details page. On the left sidebar, select **Monitoring Dashboard** to view **Room List**.

The room list displays video call records generated by the current `SDKAppid` in a specified time period and includes the following fields:
- **Room ID**: it is the room ID specified by the `roomId` field in `TRTCParams`.
- **Start Time and End Time**: you may find that there are records with no end time, which is because that the logged calls did not end in the specified time period.
- **Caller ID**: it is the username specified by the `userId` field in `TRTCParams`.
