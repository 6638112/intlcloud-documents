The event callback service can notify your server of TRTC events in the form of HTTP/HTTPS requests. It has integrated certain events under the room event group and media event group. You can provide relevant configuration information to Tencent Cloud to activate this service.

[](id:deploy)
## Configuration Information
You can configure callback information in the TRTC console. After completing the configuration, you will receive event callback notifications. For detailed directions, please see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39559).


>?You need to provide the following information for the configuration:
>- **Required**: a HTTP/HTTPS server address to receive callback notifications
>- **Optional**: a custom key containing up to 32 uppercase and lowercase letters and digits, which is needed for the calculation of signatures

## Timeout and Retry
A notification will be considered failed if the callback server does not receive a response from your server within 5 seconds of message sending. It will try again immediately after the first failure and retry **10 seconds** after every subsequent failure. No retries will be made 1 minute after the first try.

[](id:format)
## Event Callback Message Format

Callback messages are sent to your server in the form of HTTP/HTTPS POST requests, which consist of the following parts.

- **Character encoding**: UTF-8
- **Request**: JSON for the request body
- **Response**: HTTP STATUS CODE = 200. The server ignores the content of the response packet. For protocol-friendliness, we recommend adding `JSON: `{"code":0}`` to the response.
- **Package body sample**: below is a sample of the package body for the room entry event of the room event group.

### Event information

| Field  | Type   | Description                              |
| ------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
RoomId      |     String/Number       |     Room ID (same type as Room ID on the client)    |

>?[](id:UniqueId) **Definition of unique identifier:** when a user experiences unusual events such as network change, abnormal exit and reentry, your callback server may receive multiple callbacks of the entry and exit of the same user. A unique identifier can help identify that the multiple exits and entries are from the same user.

### Signature calculation
Signatures are calculated using the HMAC SHA256 encryption algorithm. Upon receiving a callback message, your server will calculate the signature using the same method, and if the result matches, it means that the callback is from TRTC and is not forged. See below for the calculation method.
```
// In the formula below, `key` is the secret key used to calculate a signature.
Sign = base64(hmacsha256(key, body))
```

>! `body` is the original package body of the callback request you receive. Do not make any modifications. Below is a sample.
>```
>body="{\n\t\"EventGroupId\":\t1,\n\t\"EventType\":\t103,\n\t\"CallbackTs\":\t1615554923704,\n\t\"EventInfo\":\t{\n\t\t\"RoomId\":\t12345,\n\t\t\"EventTs\":\t1608441737,\n\t\t\"UserId\":\t\"test\",\n\t\t\"UniqueId\":\t1615554922656,\n\t\t\"Role\":\t20,\n\t\t\"Reason\":\t1\n\t}\n}"
