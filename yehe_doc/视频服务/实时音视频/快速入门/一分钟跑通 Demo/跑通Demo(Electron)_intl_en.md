### Step 3. Configure demo project files
1. Decompress the source package downloaded in [step 2](#step2) and find the `TRTCSDK/Electron/TRTCSimpleDemo/` directory, which is the <span id="projectFolder" name="projectFolder">"**project directory**"</span> mentioned below.
2. Find the `debug/gen-test-user-sig.js` file in the project directory and open it.
3. Set the relevant parameters in the `gen-test-user-sig.js` file:
  -   SDKAPPID: it is 0 by default. Please replace it with your real `SDKAppID`.
  -   SECRETKEY: it is an empty string by default. Please replace it with your real key information.
4. Return to the TRTC Console and click **Pasted and Next**.
5. Click **Close Guide and Enter Console** to manage the application.

### Step 4. Compile and run

#### Windows
1. Install the latest version of Node.js. We recommend you choose a 64-bit `.msi` file. [Node.js download address](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Press the `win + r` and enter `cmd` to open the command line window as administrator, locate the [project directory](#projectFolder), and run the following command.
 ```shell
$ npm install
```

3. After the npm dependent libraries are all installed, run the following command in the command line window to run the demo.
    ```shell
    $ npm run start  # During the first run, the UI will appear in the window after a while
    ```
    
    ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/47f6e01acb2d927f6d9e24a7c9f78af1.png)

#### macOS

1. Open the Terminal or command line window and run the following command to install Homebrew. Skip this step if you have already installed it.
```shell
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
2. Run the following command to install Node.js.
```shell
$ brew install node
```
3. If installing Node.js with the default address of Homebrew is slow, you can consider using a mirror address.
 ```shell
$ cd `brew --repo`
$ git remote set-url origin https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/homebrew/brew.git
$ brew update
```
4. Run the `cd` command to go to the project directory and run the following command.
```shell
$ npm install 
```

5. After the npm dependent libraries are all installed, run the following command in the command line window to run the demo.

    ```shell
    $ npm run start # During the first run, the UI will appear in the window after a while
    ```

| npm run pack:win64 | Packages as an .exe installation file for Windows 64-bit |

## FAQs

### 1. Only public and private key information can be obtained when I try to view the encryption key. How do I get the encryption key?

Starting from TRTC SDK 6.6 (August 2019), the new signature algorithm HMAC-SHA256 is used. For applications created before then, you need to upgrade the signature algorithm before your can get a new encryption key. If you don't upgrade it, you can continue to use the [legacy algorithm ECDSA-SHA256](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).

**Upgrade operation:**
1. Log in to the [TRTC Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc).
2. Select **Application Management** on the left sidebar and click **Application Info** on the row of the target application.
3. Select the **Quick Start** tab and click **Upgrade** in **Step 2: obtain the secret key to issue UserSig**.

### 2. The demo is running on two devices, but why can't they display the images of each other?

Please make sure that the two devices use different `UserID` values when running the demo, as TRTC does not support using the same `UserID` on two devices simultaneously, unless different `SDKAppID` values are used.

### 3. What are the restrictions of the firewall?

As the SDK uses the UDP protocol for audio/video transmission, it cannot be used in office networks that block UDP. If you encounter such a problem, please see [How to Deal with Firewall Restrictions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35164) for assistance.
