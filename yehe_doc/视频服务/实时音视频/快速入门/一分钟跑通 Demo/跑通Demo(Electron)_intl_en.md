### Step 2. Download the SDK and demo source code.
1. Download the SDK and demo source code for your platform.
2. Click **Next step**.

[](id:step3)
### Step 3. Configure demo project files.
1. In the **Modify Configuration** step, select the platform in line with the source package downloaded.
2. Decompress the source package and find the `TRTCSDK/Electron/TRTCSimpleDemo/` directory, which is the <span id="projectFolder" name="projectFolder">"**project directory**"</span> mentioned below.
3. Find and open the `debug/gen-test-user-sig.js` file in the project directory.
4. Set parameters in `gen-test-user-sig.js` as follows:
<ul>
 <li/>SDKAPPID: 0 by default. Set it to the actual `SDKAppID`.
 <li/>SECRETKEY: left empty by default. Set it to the actual key.</ul>
5. Click **Next step** to complete the creation.
6. After compilation, click **Return to Overview Page**.

### Step 4. Compile and run the project.
#### Windows
1. Install the latest version of Node.js. We recommend you use a 64-bit MSI file for the installation. Download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Press the Windows key and R and enter `cmd` to open Windows Command Prompt as Administrator, locate the [project directory](#projectFolder), and run the following command.
```
$ npm install
```

3. After the npm dependencies are installed, run the following command in Command Prompt to run the demo.
```shell
$ npm run start  # On first run, it may take a while for the UI to appear.
```

#### macOS
1. Open a terminal window or Command Prompt and run the following command to install Homebrew. If you have already installed it, skip this step.
```shell
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
2. Run the following command to install Node.js.
```shell
$ brew install node
```
3. If it is too slow for you to install Node.js via Homebrew, consider using a mirror address in your country or region.
 ```shell
$ cd `brew --repo`
$ git remote set-url origin https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/git/homebrew/brew.git
$ brew update
 ```
4. Run the `cd` command to go to the project directory and run the following command.
```shell
$ npm install 
```

5. After the npm dependencies are installed, run the following command in Command Prompt to run the demo.
```shell
$ npm run start  # On first run, it may take a while for the UI to appear.
```

## FAQs

### 1. Only public and private keys can be obtained when I try to view the key. How do I get a key?

TRTC SDK 6.6 (August 2019) and later versions use the new signature algorithm HMAC-SHA256. If your application was created before August 2019, you need to upgrade the signature algorithm to get a new key. Without upgrading, you can continue to use the [old algorithm ECDSA-SHA256](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).

**Upgrade:**
1. Log in to the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc).
2. Click **Application Management** in the left navigation pane, find your application, and click **Application Info**.
3. Select the **Quick Start** tab and click **Upgrade** in **Step 2: obtain the secret key to issue UserSig**.

### 2. The demo is running on two devices, but why can't they display the images of each other?

Make sure that the two devices use different `UserIDs`. With TRTC, you cannot use the same `UserID` on two devices simultaneously unless the `SDKAppIDs` are different.

### 3. What firewall restrictions does the SDK face?

The SDK uses the UDP protocol for audio/video transmission and therefore cannot be used in office networks that block UDP. If you encounter such a problem, see [How to Deal with Firewall Restrictions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35164).
