This document describes how to quickly integrate TRTC SDK for Flutter into your project.

>! At present, the Flutter SDK only supports Android and iOS

## Environment Requirements
- Flutter 2.0 or above
- Developing for Android:
  - Android Studio 3.5 or above
  - Devices with Android 4.1 or above
- Developing for iOS:
  - Xcode 11.0 or above
  - Your project has a valid developer signature.

### Integrating the SDK

The SDK for Flutter has been published on [Pub](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_trtc_cloud). You can have the SDK downloaded and updated automatically by configuring `pubspec.yaml`.
1. Add the following dependency to `pubspec.yaml` of your project.
```
dependencies:
  tencent_trtc_cloud: latest version number
```
2. Grant **camera** and **mic** permissions to enable the audio and video call features.

#### iOS
1. Add requests for camera and mic permissions in `Info.plist`:
```
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Video calls are possible only with camera permission.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Audio calls are possible only with mic permission.</string>
```
2. Add the field `io.flutter.embedded_views_preview` and set the value to `Yes`.

#### Android
1. Open `/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.
2. Add `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"` to “manifest”.
3. Add `tools:replace="android:label"` to “application”.
>? Without the above steps, the [“Android Manifest merge failed”](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/39242#que6) error will occur and the compilation will fail.
