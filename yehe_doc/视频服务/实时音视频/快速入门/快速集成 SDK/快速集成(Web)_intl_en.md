This document describes how to quickly integrate the Tencent Cloud TRTC SDK for Web into your project.

## Supported Platforms

The TRTC SDK for web is based on WebRTC, which was originally released by Google and is well supported by many modern browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Opera. For a list of browsers supported by TRTC, see [Supported Platforms](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/41664#supported-platforms).
- If your application scenario is mainly in the education sector, consider using [TRTC SDK for Electron](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35097), which supports big and small (dual-channel) images, with more flexible screen sharing schemes and better recovery capabilities for poor network connections.


> ! 
>- You can run the [TRTC Web SDK Support Level Test](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/trtc/webrtc/demo/detect/index.html) in a browser, for example, WebView, to test whether the environment fully supports WebRTC.
>- Due to patent issues, H.264 encoding, which is required for stream publishing, is unavailable for Chrome versions earlier than v88 on Huawei devices. To run the TRTC SDK for web on Chrome or Chrome WebView-based browsers on Huawei devices, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to enable VP8 encoding/decoding.

## Firewall Configuration
Firewall restrictions may cause audio/video calls to fail. To avoid this, add the ports and domains specified in [Firewall Restrictions]( https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/647/35164) to the allowlist of your firewall.

## Integrating the TRTC SDK for Web
