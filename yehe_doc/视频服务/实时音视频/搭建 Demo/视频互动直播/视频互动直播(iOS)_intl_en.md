## Demo UI
You can [download](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35076) and install the demo app we provide to try out TRTC’s interactive live streaming features, including co-anchoring, anchor competition, low-latency watch, and on-screen comments.


To quickly enable the interactive live video streaming feature, you can modify the demo app we provide and adapt it to your needs. You can also use the `TUILiveRoom` component and customize your own UI.

## Using the App’s UI

[](id:ui.step1)
### Step 1. Create an application
1. Log in to the TRTC console and select **Development Assistance** > **[Demo Quick Run](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/quickstart)**.
2. Enter an application name such as `TestLiveRoom` and click **Create**.
3. Click **Next** to skip this step.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9f4c878c0a150d496786574cae2e89f9.png)

>!This feature uses two basic PaaS services of Tencent Cloud, namely [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047). When you activate TRTC, IM will be activated automatically. IM is a value-added service. See [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) for its billing details.


[](id:ui.step2)
### Step 2. Download the application source code
Clone or download the [TUILiveRoom](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUILiveRoom) source code.

[](id:ui.step3)
### Step 3. Configure application project files
1. In the **Modify Configuration** step, select your platform.
2. Find and open the `TUILiveRoom/Debug/GenerateTestUserSig.swift` file.
3. Set the following parameters in `GenerateTestUserSig.swift`:
<ul style="margin:0"><li/>SDKAPPID: `0` by default. Set it to the actual `SDKAppID`.
<li/>SECRETKEY: left empty by default. Set it to the actual key.</ul>
<img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/87dc814a675692e76145d76aab91b414.png">

4. Click **Next** to complete the creation.
5. After compilation, click **Return to Overview Page**.

>!
>- The method for generating `UserSig` described in this document involves configuring `SECRETKEY` in client code. In this method, `SECRETKEY` may be easily decompiled and reversed, and if your key is disclosed, attackers can steal your Tencent Cloud traffic. Therefore, **this method is suitable only for the local execution and debugging of the app**.
>- The correct `UserSig` distribution method is to integrate the calculation code of `UserSig` into your server and provide an application-oriented API. When `UserSig` is needed, your application can send a request to the business server for a dynamic `UserSig`. For more information, see [How do I calculate UserSig on the server?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166).

[](id:ui.step4)
### Step 4. Run the application
Open the source code project `TUILiveRoom/TUILiveRoomApp.xcworkspace` with Xcode (version 11.0 or above) and click **Run**.

[](id:ui.step5)
### Step 5. Modify the app’s source code
The `Source` folder in the source code contains two subfolders: `ui` and `model`. The `ui` folder contains the UI code. The table below lists the Swift files (folders) and UI views they represent. You can refer to it when making UI changes.

| File or Folder | Description |
|:-------:|:--------|
| Anchor | Implementation code for anchor-end views |
| Audience | Implementation code for viewer-end views |
| ChatRoom | Implementation code for the text chat room and on-screen comment views |
| Common | Implementation code for some reusable UI components |
| StatusView | Floating status view, which floats over video images and displays log information and video loading animations |
| LiveRoomMainViewController.swift | The main view for interactive live video streaming |


[](id:model)
## Tryout
>! You need at least two devices to try out the application.

### User A
1. Enter a username (**which must be unique**) and log in.
2. Click **Create Room**.
3. Enter a room name and tap **Start**.

### User B
1. Enter a username (**which must be unique**) and log in.
2. Enter the ID of the room created by user A, and tap **Join**.

>! The room ID can be obtained from the system pop-up window after user A's room is created.


## Listening for Room Status and Getting Room List for Co-Anchoring
You can use `TRTCLiveRoom` to listen for room status.

 //
 //                  Room management
 //
 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

 /// Create a room (called by anchor.) If the room does not exist, the system will create the room automatically.
 /// The process of creating a room and starting live streaming as an anchor is as follows:
 /// 1. A user calls `startCameraPreview()` to enable camera preview and set beauty filters.
 /// 2. The user calls `createRoom()` to create a room, the result of which is returned via a callback.
 /// 3. The user calls `starPublish()` to push streams.
 /// - Parameters:
 ///   - roomID: room ID. You need to assign and manage the IDs in a centralized manner. Multiple `roomID` values can be aggregated into a live room list. Currently, Tencent Cloud does not provide list management services. Please manage the list on your own.
 ///   - roomParam: room information, such as room name and cover information. If both the room list and room information are managed by yourself, you can ignore this parameter.
 ///   - callback: callback for room entry. The code is `0` if room entry is successful.
 /// - Note:
 ///   - This API is called by an anchor to start live streaming. An anchor can create a room he or she created before.
 - (void)createRoomWithRoomID:(UInt32)roomID
                    roomParam:(TRTCCreateRoomParam *)roomParam
                     callback:(Callback _Nullable)callback

## Customizing UI

The `Source` folder in the [source code](https://github.com/tencentyun/TUILiveRoom) contains two subfolders: `ui` and `model`. The `model` subfolder contains the reusable open-source component `TRTCLiveRoom`. You can find the component's APIs in `TRTCLiveRoom.h` and use them to customize your own UI.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/710358e4e170d44304cdb9bc991ad209.jpg)


[](id:model.step1)
### Step 1. Integrate the SDKs
The `TRTCLiveRoom` component depends on the TRTC SDK and IM SDK. Follow the steps below to integrate them into your project.

- **Method 1: adding dependencies via CocoaPods**
<dx-codeblock>
::: swift
pod 'TXIMSDK_iOS'
pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC'
:::
</dx-codeblock>


- **Method 2: adding dependencies through local files**
If your access to the CocoaPods repository is slow, you can download the ZIP files of the SDKs and manually integrate them into your project as instructed in the documents below.
<table>
<tr><th>SDK</th><th>Download Page</th><th>Integration Guide</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>TRTC SDK</td>
<td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615">Download</a></td>
<td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35093">Integration document</a></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>IM SDK</td>
<td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996">Download</a></td>
<td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34306">Integration document</a></td>
</tr></table>

[](id:model.step2)
### Step 2. Configure permission requests
Configure camera and mic permission requests by adding `Privacy > Camera Usage Description` and `Privacy > Microphone Usage Description` in `info.plist`.

[](id:model.step3)
### Step 3. Import the `TUILiveRoom` component
**To import the component through CocoaPods**, follow the steps below:
1. Copy the `Source`, `Resources`, `TCBeautyKit`, and `TXAppBasic` folders and the `TUILiveRoom.podspec` files in the demo directory to your project directory.
2. Add the following dependencies to your `Podfile` and run `pod install` to complete the import.

<dx-codeblock>
::: swift
 pod 'TXAppBasic', :path => "TXAppBasic/"
 pod 'TCBeautyKit', :path => "TCBeautyKit/"
 pod 'TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC'
 pod 'TUILiveRoom', :path => "./", :subspecs => ["TRTC"] 
:::
</dx-codeblock>

[](id:model.step4)
### Step 4. Create an instance and log in
1. Call the `init` API of `TRTCLiveRoom` to create an instance of the `TRTCLiveRoom` component.
2. Create a `TRTCLiveRoomConfig` object, and set its `useCDNFirst` and `CDNPlayDomain` attributes.
 - `useCDNFirst`: specifies the way audience watch live streams. `true` means that audience watch live streams over CDNs, which is cost-efficient but has high latency. `false` means that audience watch live streams in the low latency mode, the cost of which is between that of CDN live streaming and co-anchoring, but the latency is within 1 second.
 - `CDNPlayDomain`: specifies the domain name for CDN live streaming, which takes effect only if `useCDNFirst` is set to `true`. You can set it in CSS console > **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**.
3. Call the `login` API to log in to the component, and set the key parameters as described below.
<table> 
<tr>
<th>Parameter</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>SDKAppID</td>
<td>You can view `SDKAppID` in the <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app">TRTC console</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>userId</td>
<td>ID of the current user, which is a string that can contain letters (a-z and A-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), and underscores (_). We recommend you set it based on your business account system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>userSig</td>
<td>Tencent Cloud's proprietary security signature. To obtain one, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35166">UserSig</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>config</td>
<td>Global configuration information. Please initialize it during login as it cannot be modified after login.<ul style="margin:0;">
<li>`useCDNFirst`: specifies the way audience watch live streams. `true` means that audience watch live streams over CDNs, which is cost-efficient but has high latency. `false` means that audience watch live streams in the low latency mode, the cost of which is between that of CDN live streaming and co-anchoring, but the latency is within 1 second.</li>
<li>`CDNPlayDomain`: specifies the domain name for CDN live streaming, which takes effect only if `useCDNFirst` is set to `true`. You can set it in CSS console > **<a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage">Domain Management</a>**.</li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>callback</td>
<td>Login callback. The code is `0` if login is successful.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<dx-codeblock>
::: objc
 class LiveRoomController: UIViewController {
   let mLiveRoom = TRTCLiveRoom()
 }
 // useCDNFirst: `true` means that audience watch live streams over CDNs, and `false` means that audience watch live streams in the low latency mode.
 //CDNPlayDomain: the playback domain name for CDN live streaming

   if code == 0 {
     // Logged in
   }
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>


[](id:model.step5)
### Step 5. Create a room and push streams
1. After performing [step 4](#model.step4) to log in, call `setSelfProfile` to set your nickname and profile photo.
2. Before streaming, you can call `startCameraPreview` to enable camera preview, add beauty filter buttons to the UI, and set beauty filters through `getBeautyManager`.
 >?Only the Enterprise Edition SDK supports advanced beauty filter features such as face changing and stickers.
3. After setting beauty filters, call `createRoom` to create a live streaming room.
4. Call `startPublish` to start streaming. To enable CDN live streaming, specify `useCDNFirst` and `CDNPlayDomain` in the `TRTCLiveRoomConfig` parameter, which is passed in during login, and specify `streamID` for playback when calling `startPublish`.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/eab281d702879ae87728d0064a090dca.jpg)

<dx-codeblock>
::: swift
 // 1. Set your username and profile photo as an anchor
 mLiveRoom.setSelfProfile(name: "A", avatarURL: "faceUrl", callback: nil)

 // 2. Enable camera preview and set beauty filters before streaming
 let view = UIView()
 parentView.add(view)
 mLiveRoom.startCameraPreview(frontCamera: true, view: view, callback: nil)
 mLiveRoom.getBeautyManager().setBeautyStyle(.nature)
 mLiveRoom.getBeautyManager().setBeautyLevel(6)

 // 3. Create a room
 let param = TRTCCreateRoomParam(roomName: "Test room", coverUrl: "")
 mLiveRoom.createRoom(roomID: 123456789, roomParam: param) { [weak self] (code, error) in
  if code == 0 {
    // 4. Start streaming and publish the streams to CDNs
    self?.mLiveRoom.startPublish(streamID: mSelfUserId + "_stream", callback: nil)
  }
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>

[](id:model.step6)
### Step 6. Play back streams
1. After performing [step 4](#model.step4) to log in, you can call `setSelfProfile` to set your nickname and profile photo.
2. Get the latest room list from the backend.
 >?The room list in the demo app is for demonstration only. The business logic of live streaming room lists varies significantly. Tencent Cloud does not provide list management services for the time being. Please manage the list by yourself.
 >
3. Call `getRoomInfos` to get short descriptions of the rooms, which are provided by anchors when they call `createRoom` to create the rooms.
 >!If your room list already displays enough information, you can skip the step of calling `getRoomInfos`.
 >
4. Select a room, call `enterRoom`, with the room ID passed in to enter the room.
5. Call `startPlay`, with the anchor's `userId` passed in to start playback.
 - If the room list displays the `userId` of the anchor, you can call `startPlay`, passing in the anchor’s `userId` to start playback.
 - If you do not know the anchor's `userId`, you can find it in the `onAnchorEnter` event callback, which you will receive after entering the room. You can then call `startPlay` to start playback.

::: swift
 // 1. Get the room list from the backend. Suppose it is `roomList`
 var roomList: [UInt32] = GetRoomList()

 // 2. Call `getRoomInfos` to get the details of the room

    if code == 0 {
      // After getting the room information, you can display on the anchor list page the anchor's nickname, profile photo, and other information
    }

 // 4. After receiving the notification about the anchor’s entry, start playback
 public func trtcLiveRoom(_ trtcLiveRoom: TRTCLiveRoom, onAnchorEnter userID: String) {
   // 5. Play the anchor's video
   mliveRoom.startPlay(userID: userID, view: renderView, callback: nil) 
 }
:::
</dx-codeblock>



[](id:model.step7)
### Step 7. Co-anchor
1. Audience calls `requestJoinAnchor` to send a co-anchoring request to the anchor.
2. The anchor receives a notification (`TRTCLiveRoomDelegate#onRequestJoinAnchor`) that a viewer requested to co-anchor.
3. The anchor calls `responseJoinAnchor` to accept or decline the co-anchoring request.
4. The audience receives the `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate#responseCallback` event notification, which carries the anchor’s response.
5. If the anchor accepts the co-anchoring request, the audience can call `startCameraPreview` to turn the local camera on and then `startPublish` to push streams.
6. The anchor receives a notification (`TRTCLiveRoomDelegate#onAnchorEnter`) that a new stream is available, which carries the audience’s `userId`.
7. The anchor calls `startPlay` to play the audience’s video.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/05a8c6af8bdc8b441f90b297e83106fc.jpg)

      // 4. The request is accepted by the anchor
       if agreed {
        // 5. The audience turns on the camera and starts pushing streams
        self?.mliveRoom.startCameraPreview(frontCamera: true, view: localView, callback: nil)
        self?.mliveRoom.startPublish(streamID: streamID, callback: nil)
       }        
  }, callback: callback)

  // Anchor:
  // 2. The anchor receives the co-anchoring request
  public func trtcLiveRoom(_ trtcLiveRoom: TRTCLiveRoom, onRequestJoinAnchor user: TRTCLiveUserInfo, reason: String?, timeout: Double) {
    // 3. The anchor accepts the co-anchoring request
    mliveRoom.responseJoinAnchor(userID: userID, agree: true, reason: "agreed to co-anchor")
  }

  // 6. The anchor receives a notification that the co-anchoring audience has turned on the mic
  public func trtcLiveRoom(_ trtcLiveRoom: TRTCLiveRoom, onAnchorEnter userID: String) {
    // 7. The anchor plays the audience’s video
    mliveRoom.startPlay(userID: userID, view: view, callback: nil)
  }
:::
</dx-codeblock>

[](id:model.step8)
### Step 8. Compete across rooms
1. Anchor A calls `requestRoomPK` to send a competition request to anchor B.
2. Anchor B receives the `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate onRequestRoomPK` notification.
3. Anchor B calls `responseRoomPK` to accept or decline the competition request.
4. Anchor B accepts the request, waits for the `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate onAnchorEnter` notification, and calls `startPlay` to play anchor A's video image.
5. Anchor A receives the `responseCallback` notification, which specifies whether the competition request is accepted. 
6. The request is accepted, and after receiving the `TRTCLiveRoomDelegate onAnchorEnter` notification, anchor A calls `startPlay` to play anchor B's video.

  mLiveRoom.startPlay(userID: userID, view: view, callback: callback)
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>


[](id:model.step9)
### Step 9. Enable text chat and on-screen comments
- Call `sendRoomTextMsg` to send common text messages. All users in the room will receive the `onRecvRoomTextMsg` callback.
IM has its default content moderation rules. Text messages that contain restricted terms will not be forwarded by the cloud.
<dx-codeblock>
::: swift
// Sender: send text messages
mLiveRoom.sendRoomTextMsg(message: "Hello Word!", callback: callback)
// Recipient: listen for text messages
mLiveRoom.delegate = self
public func trtcLiveRoom(_ trtcLiveRoom: TRTCLiveRoom, onRecvRoomTextMsg message: String, fromUser user: TRTCLiveUserInfo) {
  debugPrint("Received a text message from \(user.userName): \(message)")
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>

- Call `sendRoomCustomMsg` to send custom (signaling) messages. All users in the room will receive an `onRecvRoomCustomMsg` callback.
 Custom messages are often used to transfer custom signals, e.g., to give and broadcast likes.
<dx-codeblock>
::: swift
// Sender: customize CMD to distinguish on-screen comments and likes
// For example, use "CMD_DANMU" to indicate on-screen comments and "CMD_LIKE" to indicate likes.
mLiveRoom.sendRoomCustomMsg(command: "CMD_DANMU", message: "Hello world", callback: nil)
mLiveRoom.sendRoomCustomMsg(command: "CMD_LIKE", message: "", callback: nil)
// Recipient: listen for custom messages
mLiveRoom.delegate = self
public func trtcLiveRoom(_ trtcLiveRoom: TRTCLiveRoom, onRecvRoomCustomMsg command: String, message: String, fromUser user: TRTCLiveUserInfo) {
  if "CMD_DANMU" == command {
    // An on-screen comment is received.
    debugPrint("Received an on-screen comment from \(user.userName): \(message)")
  } else if "CMD_LIKE" == command {
    // Receive a like
    debugPrint("\(user.userName) liked you.")
  }
}
:::
</dx-codeblock>
