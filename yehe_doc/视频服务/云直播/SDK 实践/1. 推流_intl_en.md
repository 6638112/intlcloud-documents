This document describes how to integrate the SDK or plugin into your program to implement the CSS stream push feature.

## Prerequisites

- You have activated the CSS service.
- Select **Domain Management**, click **Add Domain**, and add a push domain name as instructed in [Adding Your Own Domain](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/267/35970).
- In the CSS console, generate a push address in **CSS Toolkit** > **Address Generator** as instructed in [Address Generator](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/267/31084). Then, implement live push in your own business based on your business scenarios as follows:

## Integration into the native application
Download and integrate the MLVB SDK as instructed in the [iOS](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1071/38157) and [Android](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1071/38158) integration guides.

>! To enable RTMP stream push, you need to create the `TXLivePusher` object and set `V2TXLiveMode` to `_RTMP` when initializing the `V2TXLivePusher` component. Below is the configuration for iOS and Android:
>
>- iOS
>```swift
V2TXLivePusher *pusher = [[V2TXLivePusher alloc] initWithLiveMode:V2TXLiveMode_RTMP];
>```
>- Android
>```java
V2TXLivePusher mLivePusher = new V2TXLivePusherImpl(this, V2TXLiveDef.V2TXLiveMode.TXLiveMode_RTMP);
>```

## Integration on the web
Integration on the web currently supports only the WebRTC protocol for stream push. You can integrate the SDK as instructed in [Web](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1071/41881).

## Integration on PC
For PC (Windows/macOS), you can directly use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/download) for stream push. It is a free open-source video shooting and streaming program that supports operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.

If the stream push protocol is WebRTC, you need to configure the OBS plugin provided by Tencent Cloud as instructed in [SDK Integration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/267/42131#.E9.85.8D.E7.BD.AE-obs-.E6.8F.92.E4.BB.B6).
