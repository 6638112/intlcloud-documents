## WebRTC Push

The [TXLivePusher SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/41620) is used for stream pushing for LEB (ultra-low latency streaming). It can push audio and video captured by the browser from the camera, screen, or a local media file to live streaming servers via WebRTC.

>? WebRTC push uses the Opus audio codec. If you use an LVB protocol (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, or HLS) for playback, the system will automatically convert audio to AAC, which will incur transcoding fees. For details, see [Live Transcoding > Audio Transcoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39604).
