## Push from Web

- You can push streams from the web in the CSS console via **CSS Toolkit** > **[Web Push](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/tools/webpush)**. For details, see [Web push](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31558#web).
- You can also use the TXLivePusher SDK to push streams. For details, see [WebRTC Push](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/41620).

>? WebRTC push uses the Opus audio codec. If you use an LVB protocol (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, or HLS) for playback, the system will automatically convert audio to AAC, which will incur transcoding fees. For details, see [Live Transcoding > Audio Transcoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39604#a_trans).
