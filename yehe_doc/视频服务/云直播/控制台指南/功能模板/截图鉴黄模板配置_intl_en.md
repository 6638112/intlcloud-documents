LVB supports screencapture and porn detection. After you configure a screencapture and porn detection template in the console and associate it with a push domain name, LVB takes screenshots of the live stream and stores them or porn detection data into Cloud Object Storage (COS). If the push domain name has been associated with a callback template, Tencent Cloud will send a request to customers’ servers when a callback event is triggered during live streaming, and the customers’ servers are responsible for answering the request. After verification, a JSON package containing porn detection callbacks can be obtained.
This document describes how to create, modify and delete a screencapture and porn detection template in the console.

You can create a screencapture and porn detection template in the following ways:

- Create a template in the LVB Console. For more information, please see [Creating a Screencapture and Porn Detection Template](#Screenshot).
- Create a template through APIs.



## Notes

- The screencapture feature can be enabled alone, but the porn detection feature can be enabled only when the screencapture feature is enabled.
- Fees will be charged for screencapture and porn detection features. The former charges 0.0176 USD per thousand screenshots; the latter charges 0.2294 USD per thousand screenshots.
- The generated screenshots are stored in your COS bucket and will incur COS storage fee. For more information, please see [COS Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239).
- To enable the screencapture feature, you must first grant LVB the permission to write to your COS bucket. For more information, please see [How to Authorize LVB to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
- After a template has been created, you can associate it with a push domain name. For more information, please see [Screencapture and Porn Detection Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31063). The association will take effect in about 5–10 minutes. 
- The screencapture and porn detection templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled for the time being. If you associated a template with a specified stream through the screencapture and porn detection APIs and want to unassociate it, you need to call the [DeleteLiveSnapshotTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30832) API.



## Prerequisites

- You have activated LVB and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have created a COS bucket and authorized LVB to store screenshots in the COS bucket. For more information, please see [How to Authorize LVB to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
