 LVB transcoding (including both video transcoding and audio transcoding) refers to the process where the original stream pushed out of the live streaming site is transcoded to streams of different codecs, resolutions, and bitrates in the cloud before being pushed to viewers. This helps meet the playback needs in different network environments on different devices. This document describes how to create, modify, and delete a transcoding template in the console.

**You can create a transcoding template in the following two methods:**

- Create a transcoding template in the LVB Console. For detailed directions, please see [Creating General Transcoding Template](#C_trans) and [Creating Top Speed Codec Template](#C_topspeed).
- Call an API to create a transcoding template for a live channel.


## Notes

- LVB supports general transcoding and top speed codec transcoding. Please read the relevant billing description before using them:
  - General transcoding: it is provided in standard transcoding resource packages and is pay-as-you-go.
  - Top speed codec transcoding: it is provided in top speed codec transcoding resource packages and is pay-as-you-go.
> Compared with general transcoding, top speed codec transcoding has higher image quality at lower bitrate. Based on the technologies such as intelligent scenario recognition, dynamic encoding, and three-level (CTU/line/frame) precise bitrate control model, it enables your live streaming business to provide higher-definition streaming services at lower bitrates (reduced by over 30% on average), which effectively reduces your bandwidth costs.
- After a template is successfully created, it can be associated with a playback domain name. For more information, please see [Transcoding Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31062). The association will take effect in about 5–10 minutes.
- After a transcoding template is specified, the backend will generate different playback addresses with different bitrates for easier use. The original resolution of the stream should be as close as possible to the original aspect ratio of the video in order to avoid stretched and distorted display.
- The transcoding templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled there for the time being. If you associated the transcoding configuration with a specified stream through the transcoding management API and want to unassociate them, you need to call the [DeleteLiveTranscodeRule API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30789).

## Creating General Transcoding Template

1. Log in to the LVB Console and select **Feature Template** > **[Transcoding Configuration](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/transcode)**.
2. Click **+**, select **General Transcoding** as the transcoding type, set the configuration items, and click **Save**.
