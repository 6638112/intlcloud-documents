## Overview
If your playback domain name is to be used for content delivery, acceleration, and playback in different regions, you need to switch its acceleration region by selecting a region in the region configuration.

## Prerequisites
- You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live).
- You have added a **playback domain name**.
>?When adding a domain name or selecting a playback domain name, select the acceleration region for live content delivery (such as "Chinese Mainland") and click **OK**.

## Directions
1. Go to **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** and click the **playback domain name** to be configured or **Manage** on the right to enter the domain details page.
2. Select the **Region Configuration** tab in **Advanced Configuration**.
3. Click **Edit** to switch among "Chinese Mainland", "Global Acceleration", and "Hong Kong/Macao/Taiwan (China Region) and other regions".
4. Click **Save**.

>!
>- The playback address cannot be used properly in a non-acceleration region.
>- If the acceleration region covers the Chinese Mainland, you have to apply for an ICP filing for the playback domain name first.
>- Switching the region will invalidate the bandwidth cap configuration, so you will need to configure it again.
