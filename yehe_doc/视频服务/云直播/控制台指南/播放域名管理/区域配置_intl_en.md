## Operation Scenarios
If your playback domain name is to be used for content delivery, acceleration, and playback in different regions, you need to switch its acceleration region by selecting it in the region configuration.

## Prerequisites
- You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live).
- You have added a **playback domain name**.

>When adding a domain name or selecting a playback domain name, select the acceleration region for live content delivery (such as "Mainland China") and click **OK**.

## Directions
1. Go to **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**, click the **playback domain** to be configured or **Manage** to enter the Domain Management page.
2. In **Advanced Configuration**, view the **Region Configuration** tab.
3. Click **Edit** to switch among "Mainland China", "Global Acceleration", and "Hong Kong/Macao/Taiwan (China Region) and other regions".
4. Click **Save**.

>
>- The playback address cannot be used properly in a non-accelerated region.
>- If the accelerated region covers Mainland China, you have to apply for an ICP filing for the playback domain name first.
