## Overview
After the push via a domain name is successful, you can go to the CSS console, copy the `StreamName` in the push URL and then enter it in the playback address generator to generate a playback URL for the stream.

## Prerequisites
 - You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live).
 - You have added a **playback domain name**. For more information, please see [Adding Domain Name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).

## Directions
1. Select **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**, and click the **playback domain name** to be configured or **Manage** to enter the domain name management page.
2. Select **Playback Configuration** > **Playback Address Generator** and configure as follows:
	1. Select **Source stream** or **Transcoded stream** as the **StreamName**. If you select **Transcoded stream**, select a preset transcoding template to get the playback URL of the stream.
	2. Enter a custom `StreamName`, such as `liveteststream`. To play back the stream corresponding to the push URL, you need to enter the `StreamName` in the push URL.
	3. Select an expiration time, such as `2021-06-30 19:00:44`.
	4. Click **Generate Address**.

3. If playback authentication is not enabled for your playback domain name, you can view four types (RTMP, FLV, HLS, and UDP) of playback URLs under the domain name in **Playback Configuration** > **Playback Address**. Splice the `StreamName` in the push URL to the desired playback URL, and then you can use the playback URL to play back the stream corresponding to the push URL.

## Playback URL
### 1. Playback URL formats
```
RTMP format: `rtmp://domain/AppName/StreamName?txSecret=Md5(key+StreamName+hex(time))&txTime=hex(time)`
FLV format: `http://domain/AppName/StreamName.flv?txSecret=Md5(key+StreamName+hex(time))&txTime=hex(time)`
M3U8 format: `http://domain/AppName/StreamName.m3u8?txSecret=Md5(key+StreamName+hex(time))&txTime=hex(time)`
```
- `domain`: userâ€™s playback domain name
- `AppName`: live streaming application name, which is `live` by default and customizable
- `StreamName`: custom stream name used to identify a live stream
- `txSecret`: authentication string generated after playback authentication is enabled
- `txTime`: timestamp in the playback URL added in the console. It indicates the expiration time of the URL.

>!
>- If you have enabled domain name authentication, the actual expiration time will be `txTime` plus authentication validity period.
>- For easier use, the time set in the console is the actual expiration time. If you have enabled domain name authentication, `txTime` will be calculated according to the above formula when the playback URL is generated.

### 2. Playback URL of the transcoded stream
If a transcoding template is configured for the playback domain name, `_transcoding template name` will be added after the `StreamName` in the original playback URL for the transcoded stream.

For example, if the original playback URL is `http://domain/AppName/StreamName.flv?txSecret=Md5(key+StreamName+hex(time))&txTime=hex(time)` and the name of the transcoding template bound with the domain name is `hd`, the playback URL of the transcoded stream should be `http://domain/AppName/StreamName_hd.flv?txSecret=Md5(key+StreamName+hex(time))&txTime=hex(time)`.

### 3. Playback URL of an H.265 stream
CSS supports pushing and playing back H.265 streams. If the original stream is an H.264 stream, you can use a transcoding template to transcode it into an H.265 stream. For details about transcoding via the console and through APIs, please see [Transcoding via the CSS console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31561) and [Transcoding through APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31561).
