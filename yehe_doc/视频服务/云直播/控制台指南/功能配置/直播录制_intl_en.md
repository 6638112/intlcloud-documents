CSS supports recording live streams and storing recording files in VOD for download and preview. This document describes how to create, bind, unbind, modify, and delete recording templates.
You can create a recording template in either of the following two methods:

- In the CSS console: For detailed directions, please see [Creating Recording Template](#C_record).
- Through an API: For the API parameters and examples, please see [CreateLiveRecordTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30845).

## Notes
- The recorded video files are stored in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. We recommend you activate the VOD service in advance. For more information, please see [Getting Started with VOD](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/8757).
- After enabling the recording feature, please make sure that your VOD service is in normal status. If it is not activated or is suspended due to overdue payment, live recording will not be available, no recording files will be generated, and no recording fees will be incurred.
- A recording file is available in about 5 minutes after recording ends. For example, if you start recording a live stream at 12:00 and stop at 12:30, you can get the recorded video at around 12:35.
- As only .flv, .mp4, and .hls video formats are supported, the video codec can only be H.264 and audio codec can only be AAC.
- After creating a recording template, you can bind it with push domain names. For more information, please see [Recording Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/34224). The binding will take effect in about 5-10 minutes.
- For the naming rules of generated recording files, please see [VodFileName](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30767#RecordParam).
- Binding, unbinding, or modifying a template affects only new live streams after the update but not ongoing ones. To make the new rule take effect for ongoing live streams, you need to interrupt them and push them again.
- Mixed stream recording does not support mixing streams in and outside Chinese mainland, as recording file errors will occur and affect normal playback.



## Prerequisites
- You have activated the CSS service and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have activated the [VOD service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/8757#.E6.AD.A5.E9.AA.A41.EF.BC.9A.E5.BC.80.E9.80.9A.E4.BA.91.E7.82.B9.E6.92.AD).

## Creating Recording Template
1. Log in to the CSS console and select **Feature Configuration** > **[Live Recording](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/record)**.
2. Click **Create Recording Template** and set template information as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ccf133a64c38ce579a9fd91e37514193.png)

<table>
   <thead><tr><th width="20%" colspan=2>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
   <tbody><tr>
   <tr>
   <td colspan=2>Template Name</td>
   <td>Custom live recording template name, which can contain letters, digits, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).</td>

   <td>Custom live recording template description, which can contain letters, digits, underscores (_), and hyphens (-).</td>
   </tr><tr>   
   <td rowspan=2 width="10%">Recording Content</td>
   <td width="20%">Original stream</td> 
   <td><ul style=margin:0>Records streams in their original bitrate (default)</ul></td>
   </tr><tr>
   <td>Transcoded stream</td>
   <td> Records transcoded streams. You can select an existing transcoding template or click the name of a template to modify its configuration. If you select this, streams will be transcoded as specified in the selected template before recording. If the template is deleted, original streams will be recorded.</td>
   </tr><tr>
   <td colspan=2>Recording Format</td>
   <td>Videos can be outputted in formats of .hls, .mp4, .flv, and .aac (for audio-only recording).</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody></table>
>!
>- If an audio-only transcoding template is selected, the recording format must be an audio format as well.
>- To record transcoded streams, the system will initiate transcoding tasks, for which you will be charged transcoding fees. If you use the same transcoding template for playback, the transcoding will be charged only once.

3. Select the recording content and formats and, in the sections that expand, complete the following configuration:

      <td><ul style="margin-bottom:0px">
          <li>There is no upper limit on the recording time of a file in .hls format. If a live stream is interrupted and the timeout period for resumption elapses, a new recording file will be generated to continue recording.</li>

          </ul></td>
      </tr><tr>
      <td colspan=2>Resumption Timeout</td>
      <td>Only the .hls format supports recording resumption after push interruption, and the timeout period for resumption can be set between 1 and 1800 seconds.</td>
      </tr><tr>
      <td colspan=2>Storage Period (days)</td>
      <td>You can select <b>Permanent</b> to save a recording file permanently or <b>Custom</b> to specify a storage period (up to 1,500 days). Setting the period to `0` means to save recording files permanently.</td>
      </tr><tr>
      <td colspan=2>VOD Subapplication/Category</td>
      <td>By default, streams are recorded to the primary application in VOD, but you can also record them to a specified category of a specified writable <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/app-manage">subapplication</a>.</td>
      </tr><tr>
      <td rowspan=2 width="12%">Advanced Configuration</td>
      <td>Storage Policy</td> 
      <td><ul style=margin:0><li>Select STANDARD (default) if the recording files need to be played back for business purposes. </li><li>Select STANDARD_IA (cold storage) if the recording files will not be accessed frequently or will be stored for a long period of time.</li></ul></td>
      </tr><tr>
      <td>VOD Task Flow</td>
      <td>Click <b>Select</b> to bind a task flow created under the VOD subapplication. You can also click a task flow to go to the VOD console, where you can modify the task flow or create new ones. The bound task flow will be executed on recording files upon generation, for which you will be charged <a href="https://tcloud-doc.isd.com/document/product/266/2838">VOD fees</a>.</td>
      </tr>
      </tbody></table>

>! For **Storage Policy**:
>- If you select **STANDARD** and cold storage is enabled for the selected application/category, streams will be recorded to STANDARD storage first before the configured cold storage policy is executed on the recording files. You can go to [Cold Storage](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/inactivation) to view your cold storage policies.
>- If you select **STANDARD_IA** and cold storage is enabled for the selected application/category, streams will be recorded to STANDARD_IA storage first, and the system will then determine whether to execute the cold storage policy.

4. Click **Save**.

#### How are videos generated by live recording named?
Recording files generated by the callback of a recording template created in the console are named in the following format by default:
`{StreamID}*{StartYear}-{StartMonth}-{StartDay}-{StartHour}-{StartMinute}-{StartSecond}*{EndYear}-{EndMonth}-{EndDay}-{EndHour}-{EndMinute}-{EndSecond} `

**Description:**

| Placeholder             | Description          |
| ------------------ | ------------- |
| {StreamID}         | Stream ID          |
| {StartYear}        | Start time - year   |
| {StartMonth}       | Start time - month   |
| {StartDay}         | Start time - day   |
| {StartHour}        | Start time - hour |
| {StartMinute}      | Start time - minute |
