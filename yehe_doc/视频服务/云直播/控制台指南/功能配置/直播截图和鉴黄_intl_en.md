CSS supports porn detection (based on screenshots). You can configure a screencapture and porn detection template in the console and bind it to a push domain, and CSS will take screenshots of the domainâ€™s streams and perform porn detection on them. The results are saved to Cloud Object Storage (COS). If the push domain is also bound with a callback template, after porn detection is performed, Tencent Cloud will send a request to your server. If your sever passes the authentication, it will receive a JSON packet containing the porn detection callback.
This document describes how to create, bind, unbind, modify, and delete a screencapture and porn detection template in the console.

You can create a screencapture and porn detection template in the following ways:

- Create a template in the CSS console. For details, see [Creating a Screencapture and Porn Detection Template](#Screenshot).
- Call the `CreateLiveSnapshotTemplate` API to create a template. For information on the parameters and request sample, see [CreateLiveSnapshotTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30834).

## Must-Knows

- Porn detection is based on screencapturing. You need to enable screencapturing before you can use the porn detection feature.
- The screencapture and porn detection features are priced at 0.0176 USD and 0.2294 USD per 1,000 screenshots respectively. For details, see [Intelligent Porn Detection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39607).  
- The screenshots and porn detection results are stored in your COS bucket, which will incur COS storage fees. For more information, see [COS Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/cos).
- Screencapturing will fail for audio-only streams, in which case no screencapturing costs will be incurred.
- If you want to store the data in a COS bucket of **another account**, you need to first grant CSS the permission to write to that COS bucket. For more information, see [Authorizing CSS to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
- If your COS bucket allows public read access and has politically sensitive, pornographic, or other inappropriate content, to avoid the bucket being blocked, please delete the content first.
- After creating a template, you need to bind it to a push domain. For more information, see [Screencapture and Porn Detection Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31063). The configuration takes effect in about 5-10 minutes. 
- In the console, templates are managed at the domain level. To unbind a screencapture rule that was bound to a specific stream by an API, call [DeleteLiveSnapshotRule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30833).
- Binding, unbinding, or modifying a template affects only new live streams and not ongoing ones. To make the change apply to ongoing live streams, you need to stop them and push them again.

## Prerequisites
- You have activated CSS and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have created a COS bucket. For detailed directions, see [Creating Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13309).
