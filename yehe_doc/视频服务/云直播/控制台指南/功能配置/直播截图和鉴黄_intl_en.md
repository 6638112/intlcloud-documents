CSS provides screencapture and porn detection. After you configure a screencapture and porn detection template in the console and bind it with a push domain name, CSS takes screenshots of the live stream and stores them or porn detection data into Cloud Object Storage (COS). After the push domain name has been bound with a callback template, if a callback event is triggered during live streaming, Tencent Cloud will send a request to the client server which is responsible for the response. After passing the verification, the server will obtain a JSON packet containing the porn detection callback.
This document describes how to create, bind, unbind, modify, and delete a screencapture and porn detection template in the console.

You can create a screencapture and porn detection template in the following ways:

- Create a template in the CSS console. For details, see [Creating a Screencapture and Porn Detection Template](#Screenshot).
- Create a template with APIs. For specific parameters and samples, see [CreateLiveSnapshotTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30834).



## Notes

- You can enable screencapture directly. To enable porn detection, you must enable screencapture first.
- Using screencapture and porn detection will incur fees. The unit prices for screencapture and porn detection are 0.0176 USD per thousand screenshots and 0.2294 USD per thousand screenshots respectively. For details, see [Intelligent Porn Detection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39607).  
- The generated screenshots will be stored in your COS bucket and will incur COS storage fees. For more information, see [COS Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/pricing/cos).
- To enable the screencapture feature, you must first grant CSS the permission to write to your COS bucket. For more information, see [Authorizing CSS to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
- After creating a template, you can bind it with a push domain name. For more information, see [Screencapture and Porn Detection Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31063). The binding takes effect in about 5-10 minutes. 
- In the console, you can manage screencapture and porn detection templates by domain name, but cannot cancel rules created by APIs. If you have bound a template with a specified stream through screencapture and porn detection APIs and want to unbind them, you need to call the [DeleteLiveSnapshotRule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30833) API.
- Binding, unbinding, or modifying a template affects only new live streams after the update but not ongoing ones. To make the new rule take effect for ongoing live streams, you need to interrupt them and push them again.



## Prerequisites

- You have activated CSS and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have created a COS bucket and authorized CSS to store screenshots in the COS bucket. For more information, see [How to Authorize CSS to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
