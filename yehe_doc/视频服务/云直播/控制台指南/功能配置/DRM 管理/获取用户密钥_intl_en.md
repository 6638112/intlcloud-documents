8. Go to **Configuration** > **Ingest Settings**. Add a key seed to generate the key (key seed ID) and IV (IV seed ID).
>? A key generated by a key seed can be viewed multiple times. You can provide it to your DRM encryption provider. For simple encryption with HMAC SHA512, you can use the key seed and key ID to generate an HMAC SHA512 string and use the first 16 characters of the string as the key or IV.
