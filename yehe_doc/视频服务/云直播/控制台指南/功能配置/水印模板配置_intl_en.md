LVB supports the watermark feature. It adds watermarks to the live streaming screen to protect video content from theft. This document describes how to create, modify, and delete a watermark template in the console.
**You can create a watermark template in the following ways:**
- Create a template in the LVB Console. For more information, please see [Creating a Watermark Template](#Watermark).
- Create a watermark template through APIs. For more information, please see [AddLiveWatermark](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30826) API overview.



## Notes
- After a template has been created, you can associate it with a push domain name. The association will take effect in about 5â€“10 minutes.
- The watermark templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled for the time being. If you associated a template with a specified stream through the watermark management APIs and want to unassociate it, you need to call the [DeleteLiveWatermark](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30824) API.

## Prerequisites

You have activated the LVB service and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
