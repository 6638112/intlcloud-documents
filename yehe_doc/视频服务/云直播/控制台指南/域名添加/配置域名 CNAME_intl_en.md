Once you add a domain name in the CSS console, the system will automatically assign it a CNAME domain name (suffixed with `.liveplay.myqcloud.com`), which can be viewed in **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**. It cannot be accessed before you complete the CNAME configuration at your DNS service provider. After the configuration takes effect, you can use CSS service.



Notes

- CNAME resolution is required for both playback domain name and push domain name.
- Please configure a CNAME record at your DNS service provider. For detailed directions, please consult your service provider.
- The CNAME configuration will take effect in about 15 minutes. If you set multiple layers of CNAME, CSS cannot effectively monitor the resolution result. The CNAME configuration is successful if the CNAME domain name is accessible.
- If the CNAME configuration fails to take effect after a prolonged time, please see [Domain Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32478).

## Prerequisites
- You have prepared a domain name.
- You have successfully [added a domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970) on the **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** page in the CSS console, and the CNAME address status of the domain name is ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ed1ac2f8541f629814a3f2420b1eb79c.png) (CNAME not configured).



## Directions
This document describes how to configure a CNAME record at Tencent Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Baidu AI Cloud, DNSPod, Wanwang, and Xinnet, respectively. The directions below are for your reference only. Please follow the directions of your DNS service provider. After configuring the domain name CNAME, you can verify whether the CNAME configuration has taken effect as instructed in [Verifying Whether CNAME Takes Effect](#check).

    </tr>
</table>
5. Click **Save** to complete the CNAME configuration.

>- For more information about domain name resolution records, please see Host Record and Record Value.
>- DNS records of different types vary in priority. A CNAME record cannot coexist with a different type of record with the same **Host Record** in the same split zone. Therefore, you need to delete other records before adding a CNAME record. For more information, please see Why do I get a "record conflict" prompt when adding a resolution record?

### Alibaba Cloud
If your DNS service provider is Alibaba Cloud, use the following steps to add a CNAME record:

3. Click **Add Record** and set as follows:
  - Type: select `CNAME`.
  - Host: enter the prefix of the subdomain name; for example, if the playback domain name is `play.myqcloud.com`, enter `play`; if you want to directly resolve the primary domain name `myqloud.com`, enter `@`; and if you want to resolve a wildcard domain name, enter `\*`.
  - ISP Line: you’re advised to select `Default`.
  - Value: enter the CNAME of the domain name on the domain name management page in the Tencent Cloud console, in the format of `domain.livecdn.liveplay.myqcloud.com`.
  - TTL: you’re advised to select 10 minutes.
4. Click **OK**.

### Baidu AI Cloud
If your DNS service provider is Baidu AI Cloud, use the following steps to add a CNAME record:
1. Log in to the Baidu AI Cloud console and go to the [Domain Name System](https://console.bce.baidu.com/bcd/?_=1550137564099#/bcd/manage/list).
2. Select the domain name added to CSS and click **Resolve** in the **Operation** column to enter the DNS page as shown below:
3. Add a DNS record and set as follows:
 - CVM server record: enter a second-level domain name, i.e., the domain name prefix; for example, if the playback domain name is `play.myqcloud.com`, enter `play`; if you want to directly resolve the primary domain name `myqloud.com`, enter `@`; and if you want to resolve a wildcard domain name, enter `\*`.
 - Record type: select `CNAME record`.
 - Resolution line: you’re advised to select `Default`.
 - Record value: enter the CNAME value obtained on the domain name management page in the CSS console, in the format of `domain.livecdn.liveplay.myqcloud.com`.
 - TTL: you’re advised to select 10 minutes.

### DNSPod
If your DNS service provider is DNSPod, use the following steps to add a CNAME record:
1. Log in to the [DNSPod console](https://console.dnspod.cn/dns/list).
2. Click the target domain name in the list to enter the "Add Record" page.
3. Add a CNAME record as follows:
  1. Enter the subdomain name for the host record. For example, if you want to resolve `www.123.com`, you only need to enter `www` as the host record; if you want to resolve `123.com`, you can leave the host record empty and the system will automatically enter an `@`. A CNAME record with `@` will affect the resolution of the MX record.
  2. Select **CNAME** as the record type.
  3. Set the split zone type (required by default; if it is left empty, requests of some users may not be resolved. In the figure below, the default value means that all users except those of China Unicom will be pointed to `1.com`).
  4. Set the record value to the domain name pointed to by CNAME resolution. Only a domain name can be entered. After the record is generated, a "." will be automatically added after the domain name, which is normal.
  5. MX priority is not required.
  9. TTL (Time to Live) is the cache period for the record. The smaller the value is, the faster the modified record takes effect globally. If you leave it empty, it defaults to 600s.

### Wanwang
If your DNS service provider is Wanwang, use the following steps to add a CNAME record:

1. Log in to the Wanwang Member Center.
2. On the left sidebar, click **Product Management** > **My Cloud Resolution** to enter the cloud resolution list page.
3. Click the domain name to be resolved to enter the resolution record page.
4. On the resolution record page, click "Add Resolution" to set a resolution record.
5. To set a CNAME record, select CNAME as the record type. Enter the host record (such as `www`) as needed, which is the domain name prefix. Enter the domain name pointed to by the current domain name as the record value. Retain the default settings of the resolution line and TTL.
6. After completing the settings, click **Save**.


[](id:xinnet)
### Xinnet
If your DNS service provider is Xinnet, add a CNAME record by **setting an alias (CNAME record)**.
An alias record allows you to map multiple names to the same computer and is generally used for computers providing both www and mail services. For example, a computer named `host.mydomain.com` (A record) provides both www and mail services. To facilitate user access, you can set two aliases (CNAME records) starting with `www` and `mail` for this computer.

## Verifying Whether CNAME Takes Effect
The time for a CNAME record to take effect varies by DNS service provider. It is generally within half an hour. You can also check whether the CNAME record is in effect in the following ways:
- **Method 1:** Go to **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** in the CSS console, and check whether the status of the CNAME suffixed with `.myqcloud.com` changed to ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0fc346399ae095d69113d4944e511a20.png), which means the CNAME configuration is successful.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7930331f6eb7f4271014083cab27fb26.png)
- **Method 2**: on Linux/macOS, run the `dig` command in the format of `dig your own domain name`. If the first row displays that the destination domain name provided by CSS is resolved, CNAME configuration is successful. 
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/49aa30e1edc3884c2ae93ec5fdeeb1fb.png)
- **Method 3**: on Windows, click **Start** > **Run**, enter `cmd`, press Enter, and then enter `nslookup your own domain name` on the command line. If the destination domain name provided by CSS is resolved, CNAME configuration is successful.
