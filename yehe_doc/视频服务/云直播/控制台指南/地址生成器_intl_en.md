The CSS console provides an address generator which you can use to quickly generate push/playback URLs. The main parts of a live streaming URL include a domain name (`domain`), an application name (`AppName`), a stream name (`StreamName`) and an authentication key (`Key`).
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/55879651fe2ca61a3699ab4ed9de41d4.jpg)
After URLs are generated, you can **select and copy** the one you need or copy it by **clicking the copy icon**. You can also get the URL by **scanning the QR code**.


## Support and Limits
- CSS does not record the URLs generated. Please copy and save your URL after itâ€™s generated.
- If you need to generate multiple live streaming URLs, we recommend that you splice them as instructed in [Splicing Live Streaming URLs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38393).
- CSS provides a test domain name `xxxx.livepush.myqcloud.com`. You can use it to test push, but we do not recommend using it for business purposes.
- You can get a URL generated by scanning the QR code with [TCToolkit ](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38147).
- Make sure the suffix of the stream name is different from the name of the transcoding template used. An error will occur if they are the same.



## Prerequisites
You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.tencentcloud.com/live/livestat), and have added a [push/playback domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).

### Push URL format
CSS supports RTMP, WebRTC, and SRT for push. As a result, the push URLs generated will start with `rtmp://`, `webrtc://`, or `srt://`.

3. Enter an **AppName**. It is `live` by default.
4. Enter a **StreamName**, such as `liveteststream`.

[](id:playurl)
### Playback URL format
If you select a transcoding template, the address generator will generate playback URLs for the transcoded stream. CSS supports RTMP, HTTP-FLV, HLS, and WebRTC for playback, so the URLs generated will start with `rtmp://` `http://`, or `webrtc://`.
>! UDP playback URLs are for [LEB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/41030). To learn about the billing of LEB, see [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819).

### Adaptive bitrate URL format
If you select an adaptive bitrate template, CSS will generate adaptive bitrate URLs. Because HLS and WebRTC are supported, the URLs generated will start with `http://` and `webrtc://`.
