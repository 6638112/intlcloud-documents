The CSS console provides configurations for you to quickly utilize basic features such as domain name management, live stream management, transcoding, and recording. In addition, it enables you to perform various operations such as web push, acceleration configuration, resource monitoring, and log management. 

## Prerequisites

- You have activated the [CSS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/css) service. 
- You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/livestat).

## Overview

Click **Overview** on the left sidebar, and you can view various data, from yesterday’s traffic fees, real-time live streaming data, the current number of push channels, the number of concurrent connections, to recent trends in billable bandwidth and traffic, as well as the number of push channels. You can also switch the billing mode, or change the time granularity. You can click **Beginner’s Guide** in the top-right corner to view the directions for getting started with CSS.

### Today's Data

This section displays the downstream peak bandwidth, downstream traffic usage, the current number of push channels, and the number of concurrent connections of the day.

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Current Downstream Bandwidth</td>
<td>The current downstream peak bandwidth generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Today's Downstream Traffic</td>
<td>Today's total downstream traffic generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Current Push Channels</td>
<td>The number of current push channels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Concurrent Connections</td>
<td><li/>If the playback protocol is RTMP or FLV, the value of **Concurrent Connections** is the number of online viewers. <li/>If the playback protocol is HLS, the value of **Concurrent Connections** does not reflect the number of online viewers.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Usage Trends

This section displays the live streaming usage trends for today, yesterday, last 7 days, and last 30 days, including "Bandwidth Trend" and "Traffic Trend".

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Bandwidth Trend</td>
<td>The total downstream peak bandwidth consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the query period</td>
