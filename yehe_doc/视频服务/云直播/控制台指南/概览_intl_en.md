The LVB Console provides configurations for you to quickly implement basic features such as LVB domain name management, LVB stream management, transcoding, and recording. In addition, it enables you to perform various operations such as web push, acceleration configuration, resource monitoring, and log management. 

## Prerequisites

- You have activated the LVB service. 
- You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/livestat).

## Overview

Click **Overview** on the left sidebar, and you can view the relevant data such as yesterday's traffic fees, real-time data of live streaming, number of online viewers, and the trends in billable bandwidth and traffic in the last few days, switch the billing mode, or change the time granularity. You can click **User Access Guide** in the top-right corner to view the directions for getting started with LVB.

### Billing

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Yesterday's traffic usage</td>
<td>It displays the fees incurred by the downstream traffic/bandwidth generated in yesterday's LVB playback. You can select <strong>daily traffic billing</strong> or <strong>daily bandwidth billing</strong> as the billing mode.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data package</td>
<td>It displays the remaining traffic and used traffic in the traffic resource package under your current account (it will be unavailable if you select monthly traffic billing or bandwidth billing as the billing mode).</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

- **Switch the billing mode**
If the current billing mode is daily billing, you can click **Switch** in the **Yesterday's Traffic Usage** statistical item to view the billing mode switch reminder. Click **OK** to switch the billing mode. For more information on billing mode switch, please see [Billing Mode Change](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30411).

- **View traffic package consumption details**
To view the traffic resource package usage under the current account, click **Details** in the **Traffic Package** statistical item to enter the [**Resource Package/Plugin Management**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/resources/package?type=traffic) page where you can view the traffic/transcoding resource package usage, purchase time, expiration time, and status.

- **Purchase traffic resource package**
Click **Purchase** in the **Traffic Package** statistical item to enter the LVB traffic resource package purchase page where you can purchase desired resource packages.
> For more information on pricing, please see [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819).

### Today's data

It displays the downstream peak bandwidth, downstream traffic usage, and number of online viewers in LVB for today.

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Current downstream bandwidth</td>
<td>It displays the current downstream peak bandwidth generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Today's downstream traffic</td>
<td>It displays today's total downstream traffic generated by playback acceleration under all playback domain names.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Online users</td>
<td>It is the number of concurrent connections counted by the platform during live streaming.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

### Usage trend

It mainly displays the LVB usage trends for today, yesterday, last 7 days, and last 30 days, including the "bandwidth trend" and "traffic trend".

<table>
<thead><tr><th width="20%">Statistical Item</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Bandwidth trend</td>
<td>It displays the total downstream peak bandwidth consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the queried time period.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Traffic trend</td>
<td>It displays the total downstream traffic consumed by the acceleration service under all playback domain names in the queried time period.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

#### Changing time granularity
The LVB Console allows you to change the time granularity used when viewing the trends in billable bandwidth or traffic by clicking **Interval** and selecting the desired option on the right.
