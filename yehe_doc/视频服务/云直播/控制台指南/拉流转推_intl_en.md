If your live streaming source does not have the capability to push streams or if you want to stream on-demand videos, you can use the relay feature to quickly pull content from an existing live streaming source or video and then deliver it to the destination. You donâ€™t need to push streams yourself.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8f0b044ce2104efdc1ed835287b9b683.png)

## Prerequisites
- You have activated [CSS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/css) and logged in to the CSS console.
- You have added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970) in the console.

## Use Limits
- You can create up to **20** relay tasks.
- The relay feature is charged based on the **duration of relay tasks**. For details, see [Relay](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/41059).
- CSS is only responsible for pulling and relaying content. **Please make sure that your content is authorized and complies with relevant laws and regulations. In case of copyright infringement or violation of laws or regulations, CSS will suspend its services for you and reserves the right to seek legal remedies.**
- Starting from **00:00 on November 23, 2022**, using local relay mode will incur additional fees. For details, see the document about extended feature fees.

2. Enter the basic information:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/d10fb06aba921e27791441a112039586.png)

<table>
<tr><th width="15%">Configuration Item</th><th>Description</th>
<tr>
<td>Task Description</td>
<td>Provide a description of the task.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Execution Time</td>
<td>The default execution time is from the <code>current time</code> to <code>24 hours later</code>. You can select a time range up to seven days, and the start time cannot be later than one year from the current time. <br>Suppose the current time is 2021-3-24 11:50:01. <ul style="margin:0"><li/>You can select a time range between 2021-3-24 11:50:01 and 2022-3-30 11:50:01.<li/>The end time cannot be later than 2022-3-30 11:50:01.</ul></td
</tr><tr>
<td>Event Callback Notification</td>
<td>Enter a callback URL for receiving relay event notifications. </td>
</tr></table>

3. Provide the source information.
      - Region: Random (Chinese mainland), North China region (Beijing), East China (Shanghai), South China (Guangzhou), Southeast Asia (Singapore), Southeast Asia (Bangkok), Northeast Asia (Seoul), South Asia (Mumbai), Hong Kong
      - If you select **Random (Chinese mainland)**, the system will assign a region that is nearby.
      
4. For **Content Type**, you can select **Live streaming**, **Custom video path**, or **Image**.
   - **Live streaming**:
     - Enter a live streaming URL (**only one** is allowed).
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6795d964f41e63fa90f0c09e3ddcf060.png)
     - If you select **Enable backup**, when the system fails to pull content from the primary source, it will automatically switch to the backup source. After the primary recovers, you need to manually switch back. Backup sources support only loop of a single video.
     
  - **Custom video path**:
      - You can enter **multiple** (max 30) source URLs.
      
      - Select **Repeat** to repeat the playback indefinitely or **Specified** to specify the number of times (1-100) to play the content.
      
      - If you enable local mode, sources in MP4 format will be cached to the local node before they are relayed. This ensures smoother and more reliable playback.
      

  ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/cc30dc26f64d17f90f3e4fc76d2d9cd0.png)
      
   - **Image**:
      - Upload an image or enter an image URL. You can click **Preview** to preview the image.
      - Images in JPEG, JPG, PNG, or BMP format are supported. If you enter an image URL, there is no limit on image size. If you upload an image, it cannot exceed 2 MB.

>? 
>- The system will stop the relay task either when the playback count reaches the specified value or when the task reaches its end time.
>- After modifying a task:
     - If you change only the playback count, after the new value is applied, the count will start from 2.
     - If you change both the source URL and playback count, after the new configuration takes effect (whether immediately or after the current playback ends), the count will start from 1.
	  - If you change the destination URL, the playback count will be reset.
>- Relaying a locally cached MP4 file will incur additional fees, which are based on the duration of the file relayed.

5. Enter a destination URL for receiving the content.
   1. Click **Address Generator** to enter the URL generation page.
   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9724d77727e21ba1798485d03d6e3246.png)

   ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/b1b6f0b832bacb15b281d71fc653afb0.png)
>!Make sure the URL expiration time is later than the task end time. If you change the destination after the task starts, it will stop and restart.

   - If you select **Custom watermark URL**, enter a URL of the watermark image you want to use and click **Preview** to preview it.
   - If you select **Image Upload**, click **Select image** to upload a watermark image. For better visual experience, transparent images in PNG format are recommended. The image size cannot exceed 2 MB.
 - Position the watermark image in either of two ways:
   - Drag the watermark image.
   - Change the values of **X-AXIS** and **Y-AXIS**.
 - Click **Save**.

[](id:change)
### Modifying a task
1. In the [task list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/tools/relay), find the task you want to modify, and click **Edit**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/a0a83bf06f9b5ae9743b68b19e4c40cd.png)
2. Modify the task information, and then click **Save**.
 - You cannot change the region or content type.
 - When modifying the task end time, make sure that the destination URL is valid until the task ends. Modifying the destination URL will cause the task to stop and restart.
 - If you change watermark settings for a live streaming source, the modifications will take effect immediately. For an on-demand video source, modifications to watermark settings will take effect starting from the next video. Modifying watermark settings may cause playback to stutter. We recommend you use the watermark feature for relay only if you relay to third-party sites that do not have watermarking capabilities. If you relay to CSS, you can use the live watermarking feature of CSS.

3. In the pop-up window, check the information:

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/4cadcabeef99828ab4be144040cbfd19.png)
   - If the source URLs for **Custom video path** are changed, you need to select whether to apply the change **After the current video ends** (default) or **Now**. After the changes take effect, relay will restart from the first source URL.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9591b91b7e5e307860c9ea2244b4e14e.png)
    - If **Destination Address** is changed, the system will remind you that after you click **Confirm**, the current relay task will **stop and restart**.

## Auto-Deleting Expired Tasks

A task expires after its end time. If you have too many relay tasks, you may fail to create new ones. To avoid this, you can enable auto-delete for the system to delete expired tasks automatically at the specified time. Deleted tasks cannot be recovered.

1. Go to **CSS Toolkit** > [Relay](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/tools/relay), and click **Set** in the **Expired** area.
2. Click ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/7ed257d05a4283dc233ef406520187b4.png) to enable auto-delete.
