## Use Limits
- The recorded video files are stored in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. You are recommended to activate the VOD service in advance and purchase appropriate resource packages so as to avoid service suspension due to overdue payment. For more information, please see [Getting Started with VOD](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/8757).
- After enabling the recording feature, please make sure that your VOD service is in normal status. If it is not activated or is suspended due to overdue payment, CSS recording will not be available, no recording files will be generated, and no recording fees will be incurred.
-  The template configuration will take effect in about 5â€“10 minutes. 
-  After the template is bound successfully, the recording feature will be enabled for push addresses under the specified push domain name.
- One domain name can be bound to only one recording template. After they are bound, all streams under the domain name will be recorded according to this template.
- Mixed stream recording does not support mixing streams in and outside Chinese mainland, as recording file errors will occur and affect normal playback.

## Prerequisites
- You have logged in to the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live) and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have [created a recording template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/34223).

### Recording event notification
The recording callback URL can be set in the console or through API calls. A notification will be sent to the callback address after the recording files are generated. After that, you can refer to the [callback protocol content](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31566) for recording to take your next step.
>?The event notification mechanism is efficient, reliable, and real-time. Therefore, we recommend you use the callback method to get recording files.

### VOD API query
