This document describes how to store CSS screenshots or porn detection data in a COS bucket. You need to create a COS bucket, authorize CSS to store data in it, and then configure CSS screencapturing and porn detection settings in the CSS Console. After doing so, CSS screenshots and porn detection data can be stored in the bucket. (This feature is available in the new version of console.)
### Creating a COS bucket
1. Log in to the COS Console and select [Bucket List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5/bucket).
2. Click **Create Bucket**, enter the corresponding information on the pop-up page, and click **OK**.
