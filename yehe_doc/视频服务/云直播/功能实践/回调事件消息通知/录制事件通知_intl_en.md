After live recording is enabled, you can configure the registered callback domain name in the live recording callback template to have the CSS backend call back the recording result.

# Notes

- You need to understand how to configure the callback feature and receive callback messages on Tencent Cloud CSS before reading this document. For more information, please see [How to Receive Event Notification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/267/38080).
- The recorded video files are stored in the [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. We recommend you activate the VOD service in advance and purchase appropriate resource packages so as to avoid service suspension due to account arrears.


## Recording Event Parameter Description

### Event type parameters

| Event Type | Field Value Description           |
| :------- | :------------- |
| CSS recording | event_type = 100 |

### Common callback parameters
<table>
<tr><th>Field Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>t</td>
<td>int64</td>
<td>Expiration time, which is the Unix timestamp when the event notification signature expires. <ul style="margin:0"><li>The default expiration time of a message notification from Tencent Cloud is 10 minutes. If the time specified by the `t` value in a message notification has elapsed, it can be determined that this notification is invalid, thereby preventing network replay attacks. <li>The format of `t` is a decimal Unix timestamp, i.e., the number of seconds that has elapsed since January 01, 1970 00:00 (UTC/GMT time).</ul></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>sign</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Security signature of event notification (sign = MD5(key + t)). <br>Note: Tencent Cloud splices the encryption `<a href="#key">key</a>` and `t`, calculates the `sign` value through MD5, and places it in the notification message. After your backend server receives the notification message, it can confirm whether the `sign` is correct based on the same algorithm and then determine whether the message is indeed from the Tencent Cloud backend.</td>
</tr></table>

>? `<span id="key"></span>key` is the callback key in **Event Center** > **[Live Stream Callback](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/callback)**, which is mainly used for authentication. In order to protect the security of your data, we recommend you enter it.
