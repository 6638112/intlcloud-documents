The live recording feature records live streams in real time according to the recording template bound to the push domain name, and then stores the recording files in VOD. A recording callback notifies you of the information of a recording file, including the start and end time of recording, the recording file ID, the file size, and the download URL. To receive recording callbacks, you need to configure a callback template, specify a server address for the callback, and bind the template to your push domain name. When a recording event occurs, the CSS backend will send the recording file information to the specified server.

This document describes the fields in a callback notification sent by CSS after a recording event occurs.

## Notes

- This document assumes you already know how to configure and [receive](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38080) callbacks.
- Recording files are stored in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. Therefore, you need to activate VOD first and make sure it does not have overdue payments.
- If a recording task is created by the [CreateRecordTask](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/267/37309) API, the recording callback returned will not include the [stream_param](#message) parameters of the push URL. They will be included if a task is created using another method.
- If HLS recording resumption is enabled, a callback will be triggered only for the final recording file. No callbacks will be sent when push is interrupted.

### Common callback parameters
<table>
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>t</td>
<td>int64</td>
<td>The time (Unix timestamp) when the notification signature expires. <ul style="margin:0"><li>The default validity period of a callback notification from Tencent Cloud is 10 minutes. After the time specified by the `t` value elapses, a notification will be considered invalid. This can prevent network replay attacks. <li>The value of `t` is a decimal Unix timestamp, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 (UTC/GMT time), January 1, 1970.</ul></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>sign</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>The Security signature. `sign` = MD5(`key` + `t`). <br>Tencent Cloud splices the encryption <a href="#key">key</a> and `t`, generates an MD5 hash of the spliced string, and embeds it in callback notifications. Your backend server performs the same calculation when it receives a callback, and if the signature matches, it indicates that the notification is from Tencent Cloud.</td>
</tr></table>

>? [](id:key)You can set the callback key in **Event Center** > [Live Stream Callback](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/callback), which is used for authentication. We recommend you set this field to ensure data security.

### Recording callback parameters

| Parameter | Type   | Description   |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| appid        | int    | The user [APPID](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer).                                           |
| app           | string | The push domain. |
| appname       | string | The push path. |
| stream_id    | string | The stream ID.                  |
| channel_id   | string | Same as the stream ID.                |
| file_id      | string | The VOD file ID, which uniquely identifies a file in [VOD](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33895). |
| record_file_id | string | The recording file ID. |
| file_format  | string | The file format. Valid values: `flv`, `hls`, `mp4`, `aac`. |
| task_id| string| The ID of a recording task, which is returned by the [CreateRecordTask](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/37309) API and is valid only if the task is created by the API. |
| start_time   | int64  | The recording start time. This is different from the start time of the recording file. The start time of the recording file = `end_time` âˆ’ `duration`. |
| end_time     | int64  | The recording end time.                                |
| start_time_usec | int | The recording start time (microseconds). |
| end_time_usec | int | The recording end time (microseconds). |
| duration     | int64  | The duration of the recording file, in seconds.                                 |
| file_size    | uint64 | The recording file size, in bytes.                               |
| stream_param  | string | The push URL parameters (custom).                                       |
| video_url    | string | The download URL of the recording file.                                 |
| media_start_time | int | The PTS when the stream is first pulled for recording. This is not necessarily the PTS of the first frame of the recording file.           |
| record_bps | int | The bitrate, in kbps, of the transcoding output recorded. |
| callback_ext | The JSON object string. | The JSON object includes multiple fields:<br/>`video_codec` indicates the video codec.<br/>`resolution` indicates the resolution of the pushed stream.<br/>These are all additional fields of a recording callback. We recommend you do not rely your business logic too much on them. |
