Push error callbacks notify you of the details of push errors. You need to configure a callback address in the CSS console, and CSS will send push error callbacks to the server you configured.
This document describes the fields in a callback notification sent by CSS after a push error occurs.

## Must-Knows

This guide assumes that you understand how to configure callbacks and receive callback notifications from CSS. For details, see [How to Receive Event Notification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38080).

>! 
- Currently, you cannot configure callbacks for a specific type of push error. A push error callback includes the information of all push errors that occurred during the reporting interval. If no push errors occur, no callbacks will be sent.
- A push error callback only collects data for push errors in the current reporting cycle. The system will not handle the errors.


### Sample callback

```JSON

    "abnormal_event":[
        {
            "count":2,
            "detail":[

                    "desc":"video frame arrive interval too long, interval=3046(msec)",
