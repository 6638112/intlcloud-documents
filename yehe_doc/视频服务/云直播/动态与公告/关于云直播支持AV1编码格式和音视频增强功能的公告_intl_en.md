CSS started offering the AV1 encoding and audio/video enhancement features for a fee at **00:00 on June 1, 2022**.

Using the features may incur standard transcoding, top speed codec transcoding, and audio/video enhancement fees.

## New Features

### AV1 codec

AV1 is an open, royalty-free video codec designed for video transmissions over the internet by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia).
- It can transfer 1080p (1920 x 1080) video at 1-2 Mbps.
- It has 40% improved compression efficiency over H.264, which means you can save your CDN costs by 40% without compromising the playback experience.
- It is royalty-free and is supported by more browsers than H.265 (AV1 is supported by 75% of browsers on the market, including Chrome).
- Because both the AV1 and WebRTC technologies originated from Google, the two technologies work well together. You can use Tencent Cloud’s [LEB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/42141) product together with the AV1 encoding feature to deliver low-latency and high-quality streaming experience at lower CDN costs.

### Audio/Video enhancement
Based on our image restoration and enhancement modules and AI algorithms, we offer video quality enhancement capabilities including super-resolution reconstruction, smart frame interpolation, HDR enhancement, image noise removal, outline restoration, and other audio/video enhancement features.

## How to Use the Features

### AV1 codec

To use the AV1 codec, just set the codec for your transcoding template to AV1. For details, see [Live Transcoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31071).

### Audio/Video enhancement
Please contact your sales rep or contact Customer Service to enable the audio/video enhancement feature.
