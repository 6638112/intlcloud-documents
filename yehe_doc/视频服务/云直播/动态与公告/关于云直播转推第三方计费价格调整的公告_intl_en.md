## Billing of Relaying to Third Parties

You can use the relaying service of CSS to relay live streams to third-party addresses. Third-party relay fees are charged based on the highest bandwidth (Mbps) used for relaying in each billing period. The price varies depending on the region to which your streams are relayed.

- Application scope: Fees are charged only if you relay to an address that is not a CSS push URL of the current account (the account that created the relay task).
- Billing mode: Monthly pay-as-you-go
- Billing cycle: Monthly billing. Your bill for each month is generated between the 1st and 3rd day of the following month.
- Billing rules: By default, third-party relay fees are charged in the pay-as-you-go mode based on your average daily peak bandwidth usage (for all third-party relay tasks) in each month. If a different billing mode is used for the LVB service under your account, that mode will apply to third-party relay.
