## Notes
- The time shifting feature is billed according to the **total time-shift period**. Using the time shifting feature will also incur [playback fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2818), which are charged based on the traffic/bandwidth consumed, [live recording fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39605), and [VOD storage fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2838).
- **Total time-shift period** = **Total time-shift video length** (minutes) x **Time-shift days**
