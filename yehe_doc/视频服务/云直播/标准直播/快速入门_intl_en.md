This document describes how to get started with CSS. Before trying out CSS, you're advised to read the [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819) of CSS to get familiar with its **billable items** and **prices**.

## Preparations

1. Sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.tencent.com%2Fproduct%2Flvb) and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629). Unverified users cannot purchase CSS instances in the Chinese mainland.
2. Go to the [CSS service activation page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live?from=product-banner-use-lvb), indicate your consent to the "Tencent Cloud Service Terms", and click **Apply for Activation** to activate the CSS service.

## Step 1. Add domain names
To use CSS, you should have at least one **push domain name** and one **playback domain name**. You cannot use one domain name for both push and playback.

<span id="step1_1"></span>
1. Prepare your own domain names. For domain names in Chinese mainland regions, ICP filing is required.
2. Log in to the CSS console, enter **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**, and click **Add Domain**.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/771bbce97962dcd1cffdd94324941280.png)
>?
>- CSS provides a test domain name `xxxx.livepush.myqcloud.com`. You can use it to test live push, but youâ€™re not advised to use it as the push domain name for business purposes.
>- After the domain name is added successfully, you can view its information in the domain name list in **Domain Management**. For how to manage it, see [Domain Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31056).
>- For more information on live streaming domain names, please see [Basic CSS Features](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/7968).

[](id:step1_1_1)
4. Once your domain name is added, the system will assign it a CNAME domain name (suffixed with `.tlivecdn.com` or `.tlivepush.com`), which cannot be accessed before you complete the CNAME configuration at your DNS service provider. After the CNAME configuration takes effect, you can use CSS. The following example shows you how to add a CNAME record by assuming Tencent Cloud is your DNS service provider:
  1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Domain Name Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/domain).
  2. Find the target domain name and click **Resolve**.
  3. On the domain name resolution page, click **Add Record**.
  4. In the new line, enter the domain name prefix as the host record, select CNAME as the record type, and enter the CNAME domain name as the record value.
  5. Click **Save**.
>!
>- After a CNAME record is successfully added, it takes some time for the CNAME configuration to take effect. If the configuration fails, you cannot use CSS.
>- After the CNAME configuration succeeds, you can see that the status symbol of the CNAME address in **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)** in the CSS console has changed to ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0fc346399ae095d69113d4944e511a20.png).
>- If the CNAME configuration failure persists, consult your DNS service provider.
>- For more information on how to configure with other DNS service providers, please see [Configuring CNAME for Domain Name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31057).


[](id:step2)
## Step 2. Get push URL
1. Select **CSS Toolkit** > **[Address Generator](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/addrgenerator/addrgenerator)**.
2. On the **Address Generator** page, configure as follows:
   1. Select **Push Domain** for **Domain Type**.
   2. Select a push domain name you added in **Domain Management**.
   3. Enter an **AppName**. It is `live` by default.
   4. Enter a custom `StreamName`, such as `liveteststream`.
   5. Select the URL expiration time, such as `2021-05-31 23:59:59`.
   6. Click **Generate Address** to generate a push address.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5a377614d5da22c5193bef68f4a3a6e7.png)

>? 
>- In the push URL, `live` is the default `AppName`, `txSecret` is the signature for playing back the stream, and `txTime` is the URL expiration time.
>- Here is another way to generate a push URL: In **[Domain Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/domainmanage)**, find the push domain name you want use to generate a push URL, click **Manage**, select **Push Configuration**, enter an expiration time for the URL and a custom `StreamName`, and click **Generate Push Address**.
>- You can create and configure a desired [feature template](intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/34223) before generating the push URL based on your business needs and bind it to the push domain name. For prices of CSS value-added features, see [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2819).

[](id:step3)
## Step 3. Push live stream

You can enter the generated push URL into the push software as appropriate for your use cases.
- For push on PCs, you're advised to use OBS. For detailed directions, see [Push via OBS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31569).
- For push on web, you're advised to use **[Web Push](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/tools/webpush)**: select a push domain name, enter a custom `StreamName`, select a URL expiration time, turn the camera on, and click **Start Push**.

- For push on mobile devices, download and install [Tencent Video Cloud Demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38147), open it, select **Mobile Live Video Broadcasting** > **Push (Camera)**, enter the push URL into the address box manually or by scanning the QR code, and then tap the start icon in the bottom-left corner to push the stream.

>? You can integrate Tencent Cloud [MLVB SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071) into customized apps for live push.

[](id:step4)
## Step 4. Get playback URL
1. After push succeeds, select **[Stream Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/streammanage)** > **Online Streams**, view the status of the push URL, and click **Test** to play back the stream online.
2. Select **CSS Toolbox** > **[Address Generator](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/addrgenerator/addrgenerator)** to get a playback address and configure as follows:
   1. Select **Playback Domain** for **Domain Type**.
   2. Select a playback domain name you added in **Domain Management**.
   3. Enter an **AppName**. It is `live` by default.
   4. Enter the `StreamName` in the push URL to play back the corresponding stream.
   5. Select the URL expiration time, such as `2021-05-31 23:59:59`.
   6. To generate a playback URL for a transcoded stream, please select a transcoding template which must be bound to the domain name in the playback URL. For directions on how to bind a transcoding template, please see [Live Transcoding > Binding Domain Name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31071).
   7. Click **Generate Address** to generate a playback address.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/5025e22cd8c4c555d7de3e0360e13d11.png)
[](id:step4_1)
3. You can use the following methods to test whether a live stream can be played back normally in different use cases:
   1. For playback test on PCs, you're advised to use tools such as [VLC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32483). For more information, please see [Live Playback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31559).

   2. For playback test on mobile devices, you're advised to download and install [Tencent Video Cloud Toolkit App](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38147), select **Mobile Live Video Broadcasting** > **LVB Playback**, enter the playback URL into the address box manually or by scanning the QR code, and tap the play icon in the bottom-left corner.

>? To push/play back a stream on an app, you can integrate the [MLVB SDK](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/mlvb) into the app to supplement the CSS service. If you encounter any problem during the trial period, please see [FAQs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/7968).
