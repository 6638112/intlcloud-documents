As a lower-latency version of LVB, LEB provides superb **live streaming** experience with millisecond playback latency, far lower than that of live stream playback using traditional protocols.
Before you use LEB, please read [LEB Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39969) to learn about its billable items and pricing.

> ! LEB uses the WebRTC protocol to ensure low latency. It adopts the Opus codec and does not support B-frames. If the original stream contains B-frames or the codec is not Opus, the CSS backend will remove the B-frames and transcode the stream to Opus format, which will incur [standard transcoding fees](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39604).

## App Access
### Access instructions
You can integrate the MLVB SDK into your iOS or Android app to implement the live push and playback features.

- **Live push on apps**: supports capturing camera or mobile phone screens and then pushing the content to the CSS platform using the RTMP protocol. For details, please see [Publishing (Camera)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38157) and [Publishing (Screen Recording)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/41878).
- **Live playback on apps**: supports the WebRTC playback protocol. You can integrate the MLVB SDK with LEB to quickly achieve live streaming with low latency. For details, see [Playback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/41875).

>? The MLVB SDK uses CSS, IM, TRTC, and other services for low-latency audiovisual communication for multiple parties. Participants can interact with each other through mic-connect while others watch. For details, please see [Mic Connect](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/42210).

### Free demo
Video Cloud Toolkit is an open-source and comprehensive audio/video solution developed by Tencent Cloud. You can use it to try out LEBâ€™s capability to play live streams with millisecond latency.

## Web Access
### Access instructions
You can use the following ways to achieve live push and playback on your websites:

- **Live push on web**: the push component is designed and packaged according to the WebRTC standard, which is supported by most browsers. You can enable the live push feature simply by importing the code we provide. For details, see [WebRTC Push](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/41620).
> ! 
> - WebRTC push uses the Opus audio codec. If you use a standard live streaming protocol (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, or HLS) for playback, the CSS backend will automatically convert the audio streams to AAC format to ensure normal playback, which will incur audio transcoding fees. For details, please see [Live Transcoding > Audio Transcoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/39604). Audio transcoding will not be initiated when only the LEB service is used.
> - With WebRTC, each push domain name can be used for up to **concurrent 100 streams** by default. If you want to push more streams, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
- **Live playback on web**: we recommend you use TCPlayerLite, which supports playing back **LEB streams using the WebRTC protocol** on mobile and desktop browsers. It delivers a superb streaming experience with millisecond latency, far lower than that of playback using traditional live streaming protocols.
> ! On a browser which does not support WebRTC, a WebRTC URL passed into the player will be converted to ensure normal playback. By default, WebRTC URLs are converted to HLS URLs on mobile browsers and HTTP-FLV URLs on desktop browsers.

### Free demo

- **Live push on web**: you can test the web push feature in **CSS console** > [Web Push Tool](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/tools/webpush).
- **Live playback on web**: you can use [WebRTC Live Demo](https://tcplayer.vcube.tencent.com/webrtc-demo/index.html) to test playback.
>?
>- Both live push and live playback on web use the standard WebRTC protocol. Push on web does not include B-frames, and the audio is encoded in Opus format, so there will be no costs of audio transcoding and B-frame removal transcoding.
>- WebRTC Live Demo supports multi-definition playback. You can configure a transcoding template for HD and SD output in **Feature Configuration** > [**Live Transcoding**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/config/transcode) in the CSS console, enter in the demo a WebRTC stream URL containing the transcoding template, and test its playback. If you don't need to test this feature, enter the original URL of a WebRTC stream.
>- For more information on live transcoding and its billing, see [CSS Transcoding](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31071).

## OBS WebRTC Push Access
Push over the WebRTC protocol is mainly used for LEB (ultra low-latency live streaming). It is responsible for pushing the collected audio/video or video file to the CSS server through the WebRTC protocol. The following describes how to use the OBS tool to implement push over WebRTC.

### Notes
- Currently, OBS must be on v26 or above.
- We only offer an OBS plugin for Windows currently. If you want to use OBS to implement the WebRTC push feature on macOS, see [Web Access](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/42131).

[](id:set)
### Configuring OBS plugin
1. **Configure the plugin data**.
Download the [OBS plugin](https://mediacloud-76607.gzc.vod.tencent-cloud.com/TOBSWebRTC/Release/tencent_webrtc_plugin_20210628.zip), copy the `services.json` and `package.json` files in the `data` directory to the corresponding **obs-studio** > **rtmp-service** > **data** folder in an overwriting manner. (`obs-studio` is installed on the C drive by default, and the directory is `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\data\obs-plugins\rtmp-services`, subject to the actual situation.)
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/967335d17284d931e3a01505d45b884a.png)  
2. **Configure the plugin's dynamic library**.
Move the dll and pdb files in `obs-plugins\64bit` to the corresponding **obs-studio** > **obs-plugins** > **64bit** directory. (`obs-studio` is installed on the C drive by default, and the corresponding directory is `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit`, subject to the actual situation.)

### Configuring push link
[](id:push)
1. **Generate a WebRTC push address**.
	1. Log in to the CSS console and go to **CSS Toolkit** > **[Address Generator](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/addrgenerator/addrgenerator)** to generate a push URL. For detailed directions, see [Address Generator](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31084).
	2. Change the generated `rtmp` prefix to `webrtc` as instructed in [Splicing Live Streaming URLs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38393).
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/e4e8118922b8f4be309e33f740152006.png)    
2. **Configure the OBS push service**.[](id:set_obs)
	1. Open OBS and click **Controls** > **Settings** at the bottom to enter the settings page.
	2. Click **Push** to enter the stream settings tab, select the service type as `Tencent webrtc` and the server as `Default`, enter the previously generated [WebRTC push address](#push) as the stream key, and add `&stopstream_api=https://webrtcpush.myqcloud.com/webrtc/v1/stopstream` at the end.
	**Sample stream key:**
```
webrtc://domain/AppName/StreamName?txSecret=xxx&txTime=xxx &stopstream_api=https://webrtcpush.myqcloud.com/webrtc/v1/stopstream 
```
