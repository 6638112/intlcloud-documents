The LVB Console provides an address generator. You can use the generator to quickly generate push/playback addresses by entering address splicing information in the Console. The live streaming address is mainly composed of a domain name (`domain`), an application name (`AppName`), a stream name (`StreamName`) and an authentication key (`Key`).

After an address is generated, you can **select the address and copy it**, **click the button at the end of the address to copy it**, or **scan the QR code at the end of the address to get it**.


## Notes
- LVB does not provide the address generation history, so please copy an address once it is generated.
- If you need to generate multiple live streaming addresses, we recommend that you splice addresses as instructed in [How to Splice a Push URL](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32480).
- LVB provides a test domain name `xxxx.livepush.myqcloud.com` by default. You can use it for push testing, but we do not recommend using it as the push domain name for your real business.



##  Prerequisites
You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/livestat), and have added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
