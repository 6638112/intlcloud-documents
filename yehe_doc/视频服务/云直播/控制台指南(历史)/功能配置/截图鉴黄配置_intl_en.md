CSS supports screencapture and porn detection. After you configure a screencapture and porn detection template in the console and bind it to a push domain name, CSS takes screenshots of the live stream and stores them or porn detection data into Cloud Object Storage (COS). If the push domain name has been bound to a callback template, Tencent Cloud will send a request to your server when a callback event is triggered during live streaming, and your server is responsible for the response. After authentication, a JSON packet containing the porn detection callback information can be obtained.
This document describes how to create, modify, bind, unbind, and delete a screencapture and porn detection template in the console.

You can create a screencapture and porn detection template in the following ways:

- Create a template in the CSS console. For more information, please see [Creating Screencapture and Porn Detection Template](#Screenshot).
- Create a template with APIs. For specific parameters and samples, please see [CreateLiveSnapshotTemplate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30834).



## Notes

- The screencapture feature can be enabled alone, but the porn detection feature can be enabled only after the screencapture feature is enabled.
- Fees will be charged for screencapture and porn detection features. The former charges 0.0176 USD per thousand screenshots; the latter charges 0.2294 USD per thousand screenshots.
- The generated screenshots are stored in your COS bucket and will incur COS storage fee. For more information, please see [COS Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239).
- To enable the screencapture feature, you must first grant CSS the permission to write to your COS bucket. For more information, please see [How to Authorize CSS to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
- After a template is created, you can bind it to a push domain name. For more information, please see [Screencapture and Porn Detection Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31063). The binding will take effect in about 5â€“10 minutes. 
- The screencapture and porn detection templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled for the time being. If you bound a template to a specified stream through the screencapture and porn detection APIs and want to unbind it, you need to call the [DeleteLiveSnapshotRule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30833) API.
- Binding, unbinding, and modifying a template affect only new live streams after the update but not ongoing ones. To make the new rule take effect for ongoing live streams, you need to interrupt them and push them again.



## Prerequisites

- You have activated the CSS service and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
- You have created a COS bucket and authorized CSS to store screenshots in the COS bucket. For more information, please see [How to Authorize CSS to Store Screenshots in a COS Bucket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/33384).
