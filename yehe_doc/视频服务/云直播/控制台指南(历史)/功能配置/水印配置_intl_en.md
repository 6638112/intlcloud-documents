CSS supports the watermark feature. It adds watermarks to the live streaming screen to protect video content from theft. This document describes how to create, modify, bind, unbind, and delete a watermark template in the console.
**You can create a watermark template in the following ways:**
- Create a watermark template in the CSS console. For more information, please see [Creating Watermark Template](#Watermark).
- Create a watermark template by calling an API. For more information, please see [AddLiveWatermark](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30826).


## Notes
- After creating a template, you can bind it to a push domain name. The binding will take effect in 5â€“10 minutes.
- The watermark templates are managed at the domain name level in the console, and rules created by APIs cannot be canceled there for the time being. If you bound the watermark configuration to a specified stream through the watermark management API and want to unbind them, you need to call the [DeleteLiveWatermark](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/30824) API.
- Binding, unbinding, and modifying a template affect only new live streams after the update but not ongoing ones. To make the new rule take effect for ongoing live streams, you need to interrupt them and push them again.


## Prerequisites

You have activated the CSS service and added a [push domain name](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35970).
