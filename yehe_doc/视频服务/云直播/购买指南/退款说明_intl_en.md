### Traffic package self-service refund
You can refund a traffic package within five days of purchase if it hasn’t been used. A package that does not meet the requirements of [our five-day unconditional refund policy](#back1) is not refundable.

#### Performing a self-service refund
You can apply for a refund of an unused traffic package within five days of purchase in the console: Go to the **Package/Plugin Management** page of the CSS console, find the package you want to refund under the [Traffic package](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/resources/package?type=traffic) tab, and click **Refund**.

>? Because traffic consumed each day is billed the following day (the actual billing time may vary), on the day of purchase, a package cannot be used to deduct usage for the previous day. You cannot request a refund at the same time billing is being processed by the system. Given this, we have extended the refund deadline to 23:59:59 on the sixth day of purchase. If your package hasn’t been used, you can request a refund before the deadline.

#### Examples
Suppose user A bought a traffic package at 08:00:00 on December 1, 2022. The refund deadline for this package would have been 07:59:59 on December 6, 2022.

- However, given that one cannot request a refund at the same time billing is being processed by the system (the exact billing time may vary each day), the deadline is extended to 23:59:59 on December 6, 2022.
- If the package was not used, it would be refundable before that deadline.

### Transcoding package self-service refund
You can refund a standard or TSC transcoding package within five days of purchase if it hasn’t been used. A package that does not meet the requirements of our [five-day unconditional refund policy](#back1) is not refundable.

#### Performing a self-service refund
You can apply for a refund of an unused standard or TSC transcoding package within five days of purchase in the console: Go to the **Package/Plugin Management** page of the CSS console, find the package you want to refund under the [Transcoding package](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/resources/package?type=traffic) tab, and click **Refund**.

#### Examples
Suppose user A bought a standard transcoding package at 08:00:00 on December 1, 2022. The refund deadline for this package would have been 07:59:59 on December 6, 2022.
- However, given that one cannot request a refund at the same time billing is being processed by the system (the exact billing time may vary each day), the deadline is extended to 23:59:59 on December 6, 2022.
- If the package was not used, it would be refundable before that deadline.
