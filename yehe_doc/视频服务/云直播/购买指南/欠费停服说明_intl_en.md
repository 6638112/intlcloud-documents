> ! The CSS overdue policies described in this document took effect on February 1, 2021.

## Overdue
- The current day's CSS pay-as-you-go daily billing items will be generated next day morning. Bills for pay-as-you-go monthly billing items will be generated on the first day of the next month. For billing details, see [Viewing Bills](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/36278).
- Tencent Cloud will send you a notification if your account becomes overdue. If you top up your account within 24 hours after receiving the notification, the CSS service will not be suspended. Otherwise, the service will be suspended.
- When your account becomes overdue, CSS will not terminate ongoing live streaming immediately; such services will continue to operate and incur costs.



## Service Suspension
- If an account is overdue and has not been topped up within the required period or contains contents that violate Tencent Cloud’s rules or Terms of Service, CSS has the right to automatically repossess the CSS resources under the account **60 days** after the date of service suspension.
- After your account becomes overdue, VOD files generated by the CSS recording will be inaccessible, and the CSS screenshots (including screenshots for porn detection) stored in COS will also be processed according to the [overdue policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044) of COS.
- If a Tencent Cloud account is suspended for containing contents that violate Tencent Cloud’s rules or Terms of Service, the account cannot be recovered.



## Repossession
- If any account is overdue for over **60 days**, Tencent Cloud will automatically repossess the CSS resources and regularly clear the CSS data and records (of configurations, service logs, and client authorization, etc.) under this account.
- If you want to deactivate the CSS service and clear the CSS data under your account, please contact your Tencent Cloud rep or submit a [ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
