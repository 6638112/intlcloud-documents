When the Tencent Cloud billing platform detects that your Tencent Cloud account balance is insufficient, it will send you reminders for top-up. You have 24 hours to top up after your account falls into arrears. If you fail to do so, the LVB service will be suspended. If you top up your account within 24 hours of arrears, your LVB service will not be affected.
Please kindly note that after your account falls into arrears, VOD files generated by LVB recording will become inaccessible, and the LVB screenshots stored in COS will also be processed according to COS [arrears policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044).
If you no longer intend to use the LVB service and need to deactivate it, please contact your Tencent Cloud rep or submit a [ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
