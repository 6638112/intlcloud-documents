## Bill-by-Traffic/Bandwidth

The LVB service is billed by downstream traffic/bandwidth generated during live streaming.

LVB provides two billing modes: **bill-by-traffic** and **bill-by-bandwidth**, both of which are daily pay-as-you-go. You can choose the billing mode that best suits your needs. The default mode for new users is bill-by-traffic.

<span id="flow"></span> 
### Bill-by-traffic

LVB bill-by-traffic utilizes tiered pricing with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Traffic Tier | Price (USD/GB/Day) |
|---------|--------------|
|0-500 GB|0.0459        |
|500 GB (inclusive) - 2 TB|0.0441|
|2 TB (inclusive) - 50 TB|0.0406|
|50 TB (inclusive) - 100 TB|0.0335|
|≥ 100 TB	|0.0282|
>! The conversion scale for traffic/bandwidth is 1000. For example, 1 TB = 1,000 GB.

**Billing overview:**

- Billable item: downstream traffic generated by LVB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing mode: pay-as-you-go.
- Billing cycle: daily billing cycle. Traffic fees for the day will be deducted at 10 AM the next day. Please see your billing statement for details.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the accumulated traffic on a calendar day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.
- Calculation formula:
	- Consumed traffic = Bitrate/8 × Total watch duration.
		
		>?Total watch duration = Average number of online viewers × Average watch duration per viewer. For example, the total watch duration is the same for 1 viewer watching 60 minutes and 60 viewers watching 1 minute each.
	- Traffic fees = Consumed traffic × Unit price per GB in the tier corresponding to the accumulated downstream traffic in the day.


**Billing example:**
- Suppose a LVB session lasts for two hours at a bitrate of 1 Mbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If 100 viewers watched 1 hour each, and 50 viewers watched 2 hours each, the consumed traffic will be approximately:
1 (Mbps)/8 × 7200 (s) × 50 (Viewers) + 1 (Mbps)/8 × 3600 (s) × 100 (Viewers) = 90,000 (MB) = 90 GB.
- If the LVB session was held on January 1, 2019 and generated 90 GB of downstream traffic, the LVB traffic fees you need to pay on January 2 are as follows:
	Daily traffic fees = 0.0459 (USD/GB) × 90 (GB) = 4.131 USD.


### Bill-by-bandwidth

LVB bill-by-bandwidth utilizes tiered pricing by the daily peak bandwidth with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Bandwidth Tier | Price (USD/Mbps/Day) |
|---------|---------|
|0-500 Mbps|0.1129|
|500 Mbps (inclusive) - 5 Gbps|0.1094|
|5 Gbps (inclusive) - 20 Gbps|0.1041|
|≥ 20 Gbps	|0.1024|
>! The conversion scale for traffic/bandwidth is 1000. For example, 1 TB = 1,000 GB.

**Billing overview:**

- Billable item: downstream bandwidth generated by LVB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing mode: pay-as-you-go.
- Billing cycle: daily billing cycle. Bandwidth fees for the day will be deducted at 10 AM the next day. Please see your billing statement for details.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the peak bandwidth on a calendar day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.

**Billing example:**
- Suppose a LVB session lasts for 1 hour at a bitrate of 500 Kbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If there are 100 viewers, the consumed bandwidth will be approximately:
	500 (Kbps) × 100 = 50,000 (Kbps) = 50 Mbps.
- If you held an LVB session that generated 50 Mbps of downstream bandwidth on January 1, 2019, then the LVB bandwidth fees you need to pay on January 2 are as follows:
	Daily LVB bandwidth fees = 0.1129 (USD/Mbps/Day) × 50 (Mbps) = 5.645 USD.

>? If you have a large-scale live streaming business and the consumption of Tencent Cloud resources has exceeded or is expected to exceed 10,000 USD, then the daily billing mode may not meet your needs. Please contact the Tencent Cloud sales team or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to determine the best billing mode for you.

## Global Acceleration

>- Transcoding fees = Unit price × Transcoding duration. No fees will be incurred if the transcoding service is not used.

**Billing overview:**
- Billable item: duration of LVB transcoding (or the duration of stream mix or the watermarked live stream if the stream mixing or watermarking feature is enabled).
- Billing mode: pay-as-you-go.
- Billing cycle: daily billing cycle. The fees for the day will be deducted at 10 AM the next day. For users on a monthly billing cycle, this month's transcoding bill will be generated between the 1st and 5th day of the next month.
- Billing rules:
	- The fees are calculated by multiplying the transcoding duration by codec and resolution on a calendar day and the corresponding unit price.
	- LVB transcoding is triggered by stream pulling, and playback will incur standard transcoding fees. LVB watermarking is triggered by pushing and LVB mix stream is triggered by signaling. Using LVB watermarking and mix stream will generate standard transcoding fees, even if the stream is not played back.
	- The transcoding duration will be rounded up to the nearest 1 minute for billing.

**Billing example:**
If you used the LVB transcoding and watermarking service on January 1, 2019, where live stream A was transcoded to `H.264_720P` for 1 hour and live stream B was watermarked at 480p for 30 minutes, then the LVB transcoding fees you need to pay on January 2, 2019 are as follows:
Daily LVB transcoding fees = 0.0057 (USD/min) × 60 (min) + 0.0028 (USD/min) × 30 (min) = 0.426 USD.

- Billing cycle: same as the LVB transcoding billing cycle, which is daily and pay-as-you-go by default.
- Billing rules: billed by LVB audio transcoding duration, which will be rounded up to the nearest 1 minute.

**Billing example:**

If you used the audio transcoding service for 5 hours on February 2, 2021, then the LVB audio transcoding fees you need to pay on February 2, 2020 are as follows:
Daily audio transcoding fees = 0.00099 (USD/min) x 300 (min) = 0.297 USD.

> !
> - **New billing rules for the audio transcoding feature will take effect on February 1, 2021, and bills will be generated according to the new rules starting on February 2, 2021.**
> - [Web push](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/35968) uses the Web RTC protocol and the OPUS audio codec. If LVB is used for playing back web push in RTMP, FLV, or HLS format, transcoding will be initiated automatically to transcode audios into AAC format, which will incur audio transcoding fees.

<span id="record"></span> 	
## LVB Recording
LVB can record live streams and store them in VOD, which will incur VOD storage fees. For details, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/2838). Recording is disabled by default and can be enabled via the LVB console or the TencentCloud API. LVB recording is billed by **the peak number of concurrent recording channels of the month**. Detailed pricing is as follows:

| Billing Item | Price (USD/Channel/Month) |
|---------|---------|
| Peak number of recording channels |5.2941 |

**Billing overview:**

- Billable item: the number of LVB recording channels.
- Billing mode: pay-as-you-go.
- Billing cycle: monthly billing cycle. The current month's bill will be generated between the 1st and 5th day of the next month. See your billing statement for details.
- Calculation formula:
	- Percentage of valid recording days = Number of days when the recording feature is used in a calendar month / Total number of days in the month.
	- Recording fees = Peak number of concurrent recording channels in a calendar month × Percentage of valid recording days × Recording channel unit price.
>? Monthly peak number of concurrent recording channels: the greatest value among all 5-minute numbers of LVB recording channels in the month. One recording format is counted as one channel of recording stream. For example, if MP4 and HLS files are recorded for the same stream ID, they will be counted as two channels of recording streams.



**Billing example:**
A recording template is configured by user A for domain names A and B in the LVB console with **1** recording file format for the former and **2** formats for the latter. Domain name A has 11 LVB pushes on April 2, 2020 and has 10 pushes on other 5 days. Domain name B has 1 LVB push on April 29, 2020. The following table provides the number of days when domain names A and B use the recording feature: 
<style>#ye{background:#ffe699;}#gr{background:#c6e0b4;}#br{background:#bdd7ee}</style>
<table id="rroad">
<tr><th rowspan=2 width="10%" style="text-align:center;">Stream ID</th>
<th colspan=7 width="50%" style="text-align:center;">April 2020 (1st - 30th)</th>

<td style="text-align:center;">6</td>
</tr>
</tr>
</table>

- The number of peak recording channels on April 2, 2020 is **11**. Calculation formula: 11 Channels for domain name A × 1 Format + 0 Channels for domain name B × 2 Formats = 11 Channels.
- The number of peak recording channels on April 29, 2020 is **12**. Calculation formula: 10 Channels for domain name A × 1 Format + 1 Channel for domain name B × 2 Formats = 12 Channels.
- In April 2020, the number of recording days is 6 for domain name A and 1 for domain name B, so the total number of days when user A uses the recording feature in April is 6, and the percentage of valid recording days is 6 days / 30 days = 0.2.

Therefore, the maximum number of concurrent LVB push channels for April 2020 is 12, the percentage of valid recording days is 0.2, and the LVB recording fees you need to pay for this month are as follows:
LVB recording fees for April = 5.2941 (USD/Channel/Month) × 0.2 × 12 Channels = 12.70584 USD.

>!
>- The billing rule for the percentage of valid days will take effect on **November 1, 2020**, and bills will be generated according to this rule starting on **December 1, 2020**.
>- The recorded video files are stored in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) by default. After enabling the recording feature, please make sure that your VOD service is in a normal status. If it has not been activated or has been suspended due to your account being overdue, then the LVB recording will not be available, no recording files will be generated, and no recording fees will be incurred.
>- For more information on how to calculate the peak number of recording channels, please see [LVB Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/32479).
