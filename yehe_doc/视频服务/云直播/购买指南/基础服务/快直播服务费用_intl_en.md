## Notes

- Billing mode: **Daily pay-as-you-go mode**
- Billing cycle: daily billing cycle. Traffic fees generated in one day will be deducted at 10 AM the next day. Please see your actual billing statement for details.
- The conversion scale for traffic/bandwidth is 1,000. For example, 1 TB = 1,000 GB.
- A CSS service day is 00:00-23:59 (UTC+8).
- As LEB uses channels with ultra-low latency, its traffic/bandwidth fees are a bit higher than those of LVB.
- LEB does not support playing back live streams with B-frames. If the pushed stream contains B-frames, the system will remove them by transcoding, which will incur transcoding fees.
- Pull by web client browser only supports the standard WebRTC protocol and does not support the AAC audio codec. To push streams with audios in AAC format, the audios will first need to be transcoded into Opus format, which will incur audio transcoding fees.

LEB bill-by-traffic/bandwidth will take effect on April 20, 2021, and bills will be generated accordingly starting on April 21, 2021.

## Bill-by-Traffic/Bandwidth

The LEB service is billed by downstream traffic/bandwidth generated during live streaming.
LEB provides two daily pay-as-you-go billing modes: [bill-by-traffic](#flow) and [bill-by-bandwidth](#bandwidth). You can choose the billing mode that best suits your needs. **The default billing mode for new users of LEB is bill-by-traffic.**

### Bill-by-traffic

**Pricing**

LEB bill-by-traffic utilizes tiered pricing with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Traffic Tier | Price (USD/GB/Day) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-500 GB         | 0.0835           |
| 500 GB (inclusive) - 2 TB  | 0.0797           |
| 2 TB (inclusive) - 50 TB   | 0.0733           |
| 50 TB (inclusive) - 100 TB | 0.0620           |
| ≥ 100 TB           | 0.0516           |

**Billing overview**

- Billable item: the downstream traffic generated by LEB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the accumulated traffic on a day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.

**Billing example**

- Suppose an LEB session lasts for 1 hour at a bitrate of 500 Kbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If there are 100 viewers, the consumed bandwidth will be approximately: 500/8 x 3600 x 100 = 22,500,000 KB = 22.5 GB.
- Suppose this LEB session was held on October 20, 2020. The traffic fees you would need to pay on October21, 2020 are as follows:
  Daily LEB traffic fees = 0.0891 (USD/GB) × 22.5 (GB) = 2.0048 USD.

### Bill-by-Bandwidth

**Pricing**

LEB bill-by-bandwidth utilizes tiered pricing by the daily peak bandwidth with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Bandwidth Tier | Price (USD/Mbps/Day) |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0-500 Mbps          | 0.2065             |
| 500 Mbps (inclusive) - 5 Gbps | 0.2000             |
| 5 Gbps (inclusive) - 20 Gbps  | 0.1903             |
| ≥ 20 Gbps             | 0.1871             |

**Billing overview**

- Billable item: the downstream bandwidth generated by LEB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the peak bandwidth on a day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.

**Billing example**

- Suppose a LEB session lasts for 1 hour at a bitrate of 500 Kbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If there are 100 viewers, the consumed bandwidth will be approximately:
   500 Kbps x 100 = 50,000 Kbps = 50 Mbps.
-  If you held an LEB session that generated 50 Mbps of downstream bandwidth on October 20, 2020, then the bandwidth fees you would need to pay on October 21, 2020 would be as follows:
   Daily LEB bandwidth fees = 0.2065 (USD/Mbps/Day) × 50 (Mbps) = 10.325 USD.

>? If you have a large-scale live streaming business, then a daily billing mode may not meet your needs. Please contact Tencent Cloud sales or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to determine the best billing mode for you.



## Global Acceleration

LEB displays the usage of downstream traffic and bandwidth generated when connecting users to global acceleration origin servers. LEB provides two daily pay-as-you-go billing modes: [bill-by-traffic]() and [bill-by-bandwidth](). The default billing mode for new users is bill-by-traffic.

### Global bill-by-traffic

**Pricing**

Global LEB bill-by-traffic utilizes tiered pricing with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Traffic Tier | Price (USD/GB/Day) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-500 GB         | 0.1445           |

**Billing example**

- Suppose an LEB session lasts for 1 hour at a bitrate of 500 Kbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If there are 200 viewers, the consumed traffic will be approximately: 500/8 x 3600 x 200 = 22,500,000 KB = 45 GB.
- If you held a global LEB session that generated 22.5 GB of downstream traffic on April 20, 2021, then the LEB traffic fees you would need to pay on April 21, 2021 would be as follows:
  Daily LEB traffic fees = 0.1445 (USD/GB) × 45 (GB) = 6.5025 USD.

### Global bill-by-bandwidth
