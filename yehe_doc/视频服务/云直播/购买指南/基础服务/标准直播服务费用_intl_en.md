## Notes

- Billing mode: daily pay-as-you-go.
- Billing cycle: daily billing cycle. Traffic fees for the day will be deducted at 10 AM the next day. Please see your billing statement for details.
- The conversion scale for traffic/bandwidth is 1,000. For example, 1 TB = 1,000 GB.
- **The default mode for new users of LVB is bill-by-traffic.**
- A LVB service day is 00:00-23:59 (UTC+8).

## Bill-by-Traffic/Bandwidth
The LVB service is billed by downstream traffic/bandwidth generated during live streaming. LVB provides two daily pay-as-you-go billing modes: [bill-by-traffic](#flow) and [bill-by-bandwidth](#bandwidth). You can choose the billing mode that best suits your needs.

### Bill-by-traffic
#### Pricing
LVB bill-by-traffic utilizes tiered pricing with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Traffic Tier | Price (USD/GB/Day) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 0-500 GB         | 0.0459           |
| 500 GB (inclusive) - 2 TB  | 0.0441           |
| 2 TB (inclusive) - 50 TB   | 0.0406           |
| 50 TB (inclusive) - 100 TB | 0.0335           |
| ≥ 100 TB           | 0.0282           |

#### Billing overview
- Billable item: the downstream traffic generated by LVB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the accumulated traffic on a day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.
- Calculation formula:
  - Consumed traffic = Bitrate/8 × Total watch duration. 
    
    >?Total watch duration = Average number of online viewers × Average watch duration per viewer. For example, the total watch duration is the same for 1 viewer watching 60 minutes and for 60 viewers watching 1 minute each.
  - Traffic fees = Consumed traffic × Unit price per GB in the tier corresponding to the accumulated downstream traffic in the day.

#### Billing example

- Suppose a LVB session lasts for two hours at a bitrate of 1 Mbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If 100 viewers watched 1 hour each and 50 viewers watched 2 hours each, then the consumed traffic will be approximately:
  1 (Mbps)/8 × 7,200 (s) × 50 (Viewers) + 1 (Mbps)/8 × 3,600 (s) × 100 (Viewers) = 90,000 (MB) = 90 GB.
- If the LVB session was held on January 1, 2021 and generated 90 GB of downstream traffic, then the LVB traffic fees you would need to pay on January 2, 2021 would be as follows:
  0.0459 (USD/GB) × 90 (GB) = 4.131 USD.

### Bill-by-bandwidth

#### Pricing

LVB bill-by-bandwidth utilizes tiered pricing by the daily peak bandwidth with a daily billing cycle, as detailed in the table below:

| Bandwidth Tier | Price (USD/Mbps/Day) |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| 0-500 Mbps          | 0.1129             |
| 500 Mbps (inclusive) - 5 Gbps | 0.1094             |
| 5 Gbps (inclusive) - 20 Gbps  | 0.1041             |
| ≥ 20 Gbps             | 0.1024             |

#### Billing overview

- Billable item: the downstream bandwidth generated by LVB video streams in the Chinese mainland.
- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the peak bandwidth on a day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.

#### Billing example

- Suppose a LVB session lasts for 1 hour at a bitrate of 500 Kbps, which is the sum of the audio bitrate and the video bitrate. If you enable transcoding and specify a video bitrate, the sum of the audio bitrate and the specified video bitrate will be used for billing. If there are 100 viewers, the consumed bandwidth will be approximately:
  500 (Kbps) × 100 = 50,000 (Kbps) = 50 Mbps.
- If you held an LVB session that generated 50 Mbps of downstream bandwidth on January 1, 2021, then the LVB bandwidth fees you would need to pay on January 2, 2021 would be as follows:
  Daily LVB bandwidth fees = 0.1129 (USD/Mbps/Day) × 50 (Mbps) = 5.645 USD.

If you have a large-scale live streaming business and its consumption of Tencent Cloud resources has exceeded or is expected to exceed 10,000 USD, then a daily billing mode may not meet your needs. Please contact the Tencent Cloud sales team or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to determine the best billing option for you.

## Global Acceleration

LVB displays the usage of downstream traffic and bandwidth generated when connecting users and global acceleration origin servers. LVB provides two daily pay-as-you-go billing modes: [bill-by-traffic](#overseas_flow) and [bill-by-bandwidth](#overseas_bandwidth). The default billing mode for new users is bill-by-traffic.

- Billing rules: the fees are calculated by multiplying the accumulated traffic on a day and the unit price in the corresponding tier.

#### Billing example

If you held a global LVB session that generated 1 TB of downstream traffic on January 1, 2021, then the LVB traffic fees you would need to pay on January 2, 2021 would be as follows:
Daily traffic fees = 0.0759 (USD/GB) x 1,000 (GB) = 75.9 USD.
