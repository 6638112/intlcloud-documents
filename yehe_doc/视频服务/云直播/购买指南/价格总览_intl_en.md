![img](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/40b382f7218804c557fdb9e3ce47294c.png)

- [Basic service fees](#base): incurred by live streaming resource consumption when LVB is used. You can switch between the traffic and peak bandwidth billing modes.
- [Value-added service fees](#appreciation): incurred when value-added features such as LVB transcoding, recording, screenshotting, and porn detection are used. Such features are disabled by default and only incur fees when used.
- [Extended service fees](#extensions): incurred by use of value-added features provided jointly by LVB and other Tencent Cloud services. Each Tencent Cloud service will be charged by its respective billing rule.
