>? You can use the [CSS price calculator](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/price/css/calculator) to estimate your LVB and LEB fees.

CSS billable items include basic services and value-added services. Extended service fees will be incurred when value-added features provided jointly by CSS and other Tencent Cloud services are used. Please see the following figure for reference.

- [Basic service fees](#base): incurred by live streaming resource consumption when LVB or LEB is used. You can switch between the traffic and peak bandwidth billing modes.
- [Value-added service fees](#appreciation): incurred when value-added features such as live transcoding, recording, screencapture, and porn detection are used. Such features are disabled by default and only incur fees when used.
- [Extended service fees](#extensions): incurred when value-added features provided jointly by CSS and other Tencent Cloud services are used. Each Tencent Cloud service will be charged according to its respective billing rules.
