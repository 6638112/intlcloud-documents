The relay feature pulls and pushes contents. You can use relay to quickly pull existing videos or live streaming contents and then push them to the destination URL, without initiating a live streaming session. This feature is billed by the [relay task duration](#time) and the [usage of push to third-party URLs](#third_part).



## Notes
- Billing rules for relay **take effect since 00:00, July 1, 2021**. Relay tasks executed after that will incur costs, no matter when such tasks are created.
- When you are using relay, pulling will generate playback traffic/bandwidth usage. Pulling from source URLs of CSS, VOD, COS, etc. will incur corresponding playback fees as well as download fees.
