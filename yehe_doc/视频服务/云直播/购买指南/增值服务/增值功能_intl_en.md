Local mode for relay is an extended feature of CSS. If you enable local mode, the MP4 files of a relay task will be cached to the local node before they are relayed. This ensures smoother and more reliable playback.



## Notes
In addition to extended feature fees for using local mode, there will also be [relay fees](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/267/41059).

- The relay fee: `0.00032 (USD/minute) x 100 (minutes) = 0.032 (USD)`
- The extended feature fee: `0.01515 (USD) x 0.02 (billing unit/minute) Ã— 60 (minutes) =0.01818 (USD)`
