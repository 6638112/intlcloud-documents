Before using CSS, you need to know the following use limits:

<table>
<tr><th>Item</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>CSS domain name</td>
<td><ul style="margin:0">
 <li>Multiple playback and push domain names can be created under an account by default. If the acceleration region of a domain name is the Chinese mainland or global, the domain name must get an ICP filing from the MIIT, and the current filing information must be normal and available.</li>
    <li>You can manage up to 100 domain names under one account by default. If your business scale is large, you can <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a> to apply for increasing the maximum number of domain names.</li>
    <li>We recommend you keep the length of a domain name no more than 45 characters. If you want a <strong>longer</strong> domain name, you need to <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a> for assistance.</li>
<li>A domain name managed by CSS can be used to push or play back live streams normally only after being resolved. For more information, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/31057">Configuring CNAME for Domain Name</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Live push</td>
<td>The CSS service does not limit the push bitrate and supports common resolutions and corresponding bitrates. To avoid push lag, we recommend you keep the bitrate below 4 Mbps.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Live playback</td>
<td><ul style="margin:0">
	<li>Only when the `StreamName` of the playback address is the same as that of the push address can the corresponding stream be played back.</li>
	<li>The number of live streaming viewers is not limited, and you can set a bandwidth limit.</li>
	<li/>If you have large-scale business surges, you need to <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a> or contact your Tencent Cloud rep 3 business days in advance for assistance. Such surges mainly include the following two types of scenarios:<ul style="margin:0">
		<li/>The sudden daily peak bandwidth exceeds 200 Gbps, and the surge is 200% of the daily peak.
		<li/>The sudden daily peak bandwidth exceeds 500 Gbps.
	</ul>
</ul></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Template configuration</td>
<td>After the association with a template is successfully configured, it will take effect in 5â€“10 minutes.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Daily billing mode switch</td>
<td>You can select bill-by-traffic or bill-by-bandwidth for daily billing, and you can switch the billing mode only once per day (the switch will take effect on the next day).</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Supported push protocols</td>
<td>CSS supports the RTMP and SRT protocols. For more information, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/7968">Live Streaming Basics</a>.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Supported playback protocols</td>
<td><ul style="margin:0">
	<li>CSS supports the RTMP, FLV, and HLS playback protocols. For more information, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/7968">Live Streaming Basics</a>.</li>
	<li>LEB supports the WebRTC playback protocol.</li>
</ul></td>
