The TXLivePusher SDK is used to push streams for LEB (ultra-low latency streaming). It can push audio and video the browser captures from the camera, screen, or a local media file to live streaming servers via WebRTC.
>! With WebRTC, each push domain name can be used for up to **100 concurrent streams** by default. If you want to push more streams, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

## Basics

Below are some basics you need to know before integrating the SDK.

### Splicing push URLs

To use Tencent Cloud live streaming services, you need to splice push URLs in the format required by Tencent Cloud, which consists of four parts.

An authentication key is not required. You can enable push authentication if you need hotlink protection. For details, see [Splicing Live Streaming URLs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38393).

### Browser support

Push for LEB relies on WebRTC and therefore can only be used on OS and browsers that support WebRTC.

The audio/video capturing feature is poorly supported on mobile browsers. For example, mobile browsers do not support screen recording, and only iOS 14.3 and later allow requesting camera access. Therefore, the push SDK is mainly used on desktop browsers. The latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all support push for LEB.

To push streams via mobile browsers, use the MLVB SDK.

## SDK Integration

### Step 1. Prepare the page

Add an initialization script to the (desktop) page from which streams are to be pushed.

```html
<script src="https://imgcache.qq.com/open/qcloud/live/webrtc/js/TXLivePusher-1.0.2.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```
>? The script needs to be imported into the `body` part of the HTML code. If it is imported into the `head` part, an error will be reported.

If your business is in a domain-limited region, you can import the following link:

```html
<script src="https://cloudcache.tencent-cloud.com/open/qcloud/live/webrtc/js/TXLivePusher-1.0.2.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

### Step 2. Add a container to the HTML page

Add a player container to the section of the page where local video is to be played. This is achieved by adding a div and giving it a name, for example, `id_local_video`. Local video will be rendered in the container. To adjust the size of the container, style the div using CSS.

```html
<div id="id_local_video" style="width:100%;height:500px;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;"></div>
```

### Step 3. Push streams
1. **Generate an instance of the push SDK:**
Generate an instance of the global object `TXLivePusher`. All subsequent operations will be performed via the instance.
```javascript
var livePusher = new TXLivePusher();
```
2. **Specify the local video player container:**
Specify the div for the local video player container, which is where audio and video captured by the browser will be rendered.
```javascript
livePusher.setRenderView('id_local_video');
```
>?The video element generated via `setRenderView` is unmuted by default. To mute video, obtain the video element using the code below.
>```javascript
document.getElementById('id_local_video').getElementsByTagName('video')[0].muted = true;
```
3. **Set audio/video quality:**
Audio/video quality should be set before capturing. You can specify quality parameters if the default settings do not meet your requirements.
```javascript
// Set video quality
livePusher.setVideoQuality('720p');
// Set audio quality
livePusher.setAudioQuality('standard');
// Set the frame rate
livePusher.setProperty('setVideoFPS', 25);
```
4. **Capture streams:**
You can capture streams from the camera, mic, screen and local media files. If capturing is successful, the player container will start playing the audio/video captured.
```javascript
// Turn the camera on
livePusher.startCamera();
// Turn the mic on
livePusher.startMicrophone();
```
5. **Push streams:**
Pass in the LEB push URL to start pushing streams. For the format of push URLs, see [Splicing Live Streaming URLs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/38393). You need to replace the prefix `rtmp://` with `webrtc://`.
```javascript
livePusher.startPush('webrtc://domain/AppName/StreamName?txSecret=xxx&txTime=xxx');
```
>?Before push, make sure that audio/video streams are captured successfully, or you will fail to call the push API. You can use the code below to push streams automatically after audio/video is captured, that is, after the callback for capturing the first audio or video frame is received. If both audio and video are captured, push starts only after both the callback for capturing the first audio frame and that for the first video frame are received.
```javascript
var hasVideo = false;
var hasAudio = false;
var isPush = false;
livePusher.setObserver({
    onCaptureFirstAudioFrame: function() {
      hasAudio = true;
      if (hasVideo && !isPush) {
        isPush = true;
        livePusher.startPush('webrtc://domain/AppName/StreamName?txSecret=xxx&txTime=xxx');
      }
    },
    onCaptureFirstVideoFrame: function() {
      hasVideo = true;
      if (hasAudio && !isPush) {
        isPush = true;
        livePusher.startPush('webrtc://domain/AppName/StreamName?txSecret=xxx&txTime=xxx');
      }
    }
});
```
</dx-codeblock>
6. **Stop push:**
```javascript
livePusher.stopPush();
```
7. **Stop capturing audio and video:**
```javascript
// Turn the camera off
livePusher.stopCamera();
// Turn the mic off
livePusher.stopMicrophone();
```

## Advanced Features
### Compatibility
The SDK provides a static method to check whether a browser supports WebRTC.

<dx-codeblock>
::: javascript javascript
TXLivePusher.checkSupport().then(function(data) {  
  // Whether WebRTC is supported  
  if (data.isWebRTCSupported) {    
    console.log('WebRTC Support');  
  } else {    
    console.log('WebRTC Not Support');  
  }  
  // Whether H.264 is supported  
  if (data.isH264EncodeSupported) {    
    console.log('H264 Encode Support');  
  } else {    
    console.log('H264 Encode Not Support');  
  }
});
:::
</dx-codeblock>

### Event callbacks
The SDK supports callback event notifications. You can set an observer to receive callbacks of the SDKâ€™s status and WebRTC-related statistics.
<dx-codeblock>
::: javascript javascript
livePusher.setObserver({
  // Warnings for push
  onWarning: function(code, msg) {
    console.log(code, msg);
  },
  // Push status
  onPushStatusUpdate: function(status, msg) {
    console.log(status, msg);
  },
  // Push statistics
  onStatisticsUpdate: function(data) {
    console.log('video fps is ' + data.video.framesPerSecond);
  }
});
:::
</dx-codeblock>

### Device management

You can use a device management instance to get the device list, switch devices, and perform other device-related operations.
<dx-codeblock>
::: javascript javascript
var deviceManager = livePusher.getDeviceManager();
// Get the device list
deviceManager.getDevicesList().then(function(data) {
  data.forEach(function(device) {
      console.log(device.deviceId, device.deviceName);  
  });
});
// Switch cameras
deviceManager.switchCamera('camera_device_id');
:::
</dx-codeblock>
