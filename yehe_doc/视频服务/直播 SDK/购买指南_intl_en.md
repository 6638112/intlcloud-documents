### MLVB License Fee

You need an MLVB Professional license to access the MLVB Professional SDK on iOS and Android.

#### Notes

- Each account can **apply for 1 free trial license** to try out MLVB Professional. A trial license is valid for 14 days, after which you can renew the license in the console for another 14 days. In other words, you can use the trial license for up to 28 days. Sign up for an account in the [CSS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/license) now and follow the directions in [License User Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38546) to try out MLVB.
- **Each MLVB Professional license can be bound to 1 iOS bundle ID and 1 Android package name, whether you use it in the development or production environment.** If you have multiple projects that need to use the MLVB SDK, you have to purchase multiple licenses.
- An MLVB Professional license becomes valid from the day of purchase and can be bound to a new project (bundle ID/package name) or replace an existing MLVB Professional license. After replacement, the validity period of the new license will apply to the project in question. The replaced license will be unbound from the project and its validity period will remain unchanged.

### CSS

If you use the MLVB SDK together with CSS, you will also be charged CSS basic service fees, such as bandwidth fees based on the billing standards of CSS. You can choose to pay daily or monthly. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2818).

## Refunds

MLVB Professional does not allow refunds.

## Overdue Payments

There is no such thing as an overdue payment for MLVB licenses per se. However, if you have purchased other Tencent Cloud services and there isnâ€™t enough balance in your account, you will be prompted to pay the overdue payment. If you fail to make the payment after the 24-hour grace period, your account will no longer have access to the console, which can affect your use of MLVB.
