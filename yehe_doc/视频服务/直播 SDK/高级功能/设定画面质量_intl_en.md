## Features
LiveAVSDK uses the `setVideoQuality` API provided by `V2TXLivePusher` to set video quality.

### API definition
You can use `setVideoQuality` to set the resolution and resolution mode (landscape/portrait) of published video.
```
public abstract int setVideoQuality(V2TXLiveVideoEncoderParam param);
```
#### Parameters
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| param | [V2TXLiveVideoEncoderParam](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/api/zh-cn/group__V2TXLiveDef__android.html#classcom_1_1tencent_1_1live2_1_1V2TXLiveDef_1_1V2TXLiveVideoEncoderParam) | Video encoding parameters. |

## Note

For smoother mic connect experience, after mic connect starts, please call `setVideoQuality()` to set the host’s resolution to `V2TXLiveVideoResolution640x360` and the mic-connecting audience’s resolution to `V2TXLiveVideoResolution480x360`. After mic connect ends, you can call `setVideoQuality()` again to set the resolutions to previous values.

## FAQs

### 1. Why is the video delivered to audience not as clear as that watched by the host?
The video watched by the host is the raw data captured by the camera after pre-processing (beauty filter application, mirroring, clipping, etc.) and therefore is of high quality. However, the video watched by audience has been compressed and then decoded by the codec. Encoding compromises video quality (the lower the target resolution, the more the video is compressed), which is why the video delivered to audience is not as clear as that watched by the host.

### 2. Why does `V2TXLivePusher` sometimes publish video at a resolution of 368 × 640 or 544 × 960?
If you enable hardware acceleration, the video published may have atypical resolutions such as 368 × 640 or 544 × 960. This is because some hardware encoders do not allow resolutions that aren’t a multiple of 16. You can change the fill mode of the player to get rid of black bars.
