>? You can renew a trial license **only once**, which means a trial license is valid for up to 28 days. To continue using the MLVB SDK after 28 days, you need to [purchase an official license](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38546#.E6.AD.A3.E5.BC.8F.E7.89.88-license).

## Official License

### Purchasing official license

1. [Purchase an official license](https://buy.intl.cloud.tencent.com/mlvb) for one-year access to the MLVB Professional SDK. An official license expires at 00:00:00 the next day after the purchase date a year later. For pricing details, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38114).

>? For example, assume that you purchased an official license at 14:16:52 on December 1, 2021. The license would expire at 00:00:00 on December 2, 2022.

2. Go to **MLVB SDK** > **[License Management](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/live/license)**, click **Create**, enter an application name, package name, and bundle ID, and click **Confirm**.

   >? 
   >- Before clicking **Confirm**, double-check the bundle ID and package name. You can modify the information if it is inconsistent with what you submit to app stores. **License information cannot be modified after submission.**
   >- **You cannot modify the information of an official license.** However, you can, after purchasing a new license, click **Create** to create a new license (instead of using it to renew your existing license) and bind it to a new bundle ID/package name.

3. After an official license is successfully created, the page will display the information of the license. You need to pass in `Key` and `LicenseUrl` during the initialization of the SDK. Please store the information properly.
