## Overview
Publishing from screen means using hosts’ phones as the source for live streaming. It may be combined with local camera preview and is used in scenarios such as game streaming and mobile application demonstration. Tencent Cloud’s LiteAVSDK offers the screen sharing capability via `V2TXLivePusher`. 
>? By adding a floating window to display the image of the local camera, you can include camera preview into the streams published from the screen.



## Restrictions
- Screen recording is supported in Android 5.0 and above.
- Floating windows need to be enabled manually on some mobile phones and systems.

## Sample Code
Regarding frequently asked questions among developers, Tencent Cloud offers a straightforward API example project, which you can use to quickly learn how to use different APIs.

## Integration
[](id:step1)
### Step 1. Create a stream publishing object
Create a **V2TXLivePusher** object, which will be responsible for publishing operations.

```java
V2TXLivePusher mLivePusher = new V2TXLivePusherImpl(context, V2TXLiveDef.V2TXLiveMode.TXLiveMode_RTMP);
```

[](id:step2)
### Step 2. Start stream publishing
After completing [Step 1](#step1), you can use the code below to start publishing streams:
```java
String rtmpUrl = "rtmp://2157.livepush.myqcloud.com/live/xxxxxx";
mLivePusher.startMicrophone();
mLivePusher.startScreenCapture();
mLivePusher.startPush(rtmpUrl);
```
- **startScreenCapture** is used to start screen recording, which is a built-in feature of the Android system. For security reasons, before screen recording starts, Android will pop up a window asking users whether to start screen recording, and you should agree.
- **startPush** is used to inform LiteAVSDK of which URL to publish audio/video streams to.

[](id:step3)
### Step 3. Set watermarks
Call [setWatermark](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/api/zh-cn/group__V2TXLivePusher__android.html#a4f56a5a937d87e5b1ae6f77c5bab2335) in `V2TXLivePusher` to add a watermark to videos output by the SDK. The position of the watermark is determined by the `(x, y, scale)` parameter passed in.

- The watermark image must be in PNG rather than JPG format. The former carries opacity information, which allows the SDK to better address the image aliasing issue (changing the extension of a JPG image to PNG won’t work).
- The `(x, y, scale)` parameter specifies the normalized coordinates of the watermark relative to the resolution of the published video. For example, if the resolution of the published video is 540 x 960, and `(x, y, scale)` is set to `（0.1, 0.1, 0.1）`, the actual pixel coordinates of the watermark will be (540 x 0.1, 960 x 0.1). The width of the watermark will be the video width x 0.1, and the height will be scaled automatically.

```java 
// Set a video watermark 
mLivePusher.setWatermark(BitmapFactory.decodeResource(getResources(),R.drawable.watermark), 0.03f, 0.015f, 1f); 
```

[](id:step4)
### Step 4. Set video quality
Call `setVideoQuality` in `V2TXLivePusher` to set the quality of videos watched by audience. The encoding parameters set determine the quality of videos presented to audience. The local video watched by the host is the original HD version that has not been encoded or compressed, and is therefore not affected by the settings. For details, please see [Setting Video Quality](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/41861).

[](id:step5)
### Step 5. Inform hosts of poor network conditions
Connecting phones to Wi-Fi does not necessarily guarantee network conditions. In case of poor Wi-Fi signal or limited bandwidth, the network speed of a Wi-Fi connected phone may be slower than that of a phone using 4G. Hosts should be informed when their network conditions are bad and be prompted to switch to a different network.    
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/faaef46a80988270d3ddc96ec4e578b9.png)  

You can capture the **V2TXLIVE_WARNING_NETWORK_BUSY** event using [onWarning](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/api/zh-cn/group__V2TXLiveCode__android.html) in `V2TXLivePusherObserver`. The event indicates poor network conditions for hosts, which result in stuttering for audience. When this event occurs, you can send a UI message about poor network conditions to hosts, as shown above.
<dx-codeblock>
::: objectiveC objectiveC
@Override
public void onWarning(int code, String msg, Bundle extraInfo) {
    if (code == V2TXLiveCode.V2TXLIVE_WARNING_NETWORK_BUSY) {
        showNetBusyTips(); // Show a “network busy” message
    }
} 
:::
</dx-codeblock>

[](id:step6)
### Step 6. Set the orientation
In most cases, hosts stream while holding their phones vertically, and audience watch videos in portrait resolutions (e.g., 540 × 960). However, there are also cases where hosts hold phones horizontally, and ideally, audience should watch videos in landscape resolutions (960 × 540), as shown below: 
    

By default, `V2TXLivePusher` outputs videos in portrait resolutions. You can output landscape-mode videos to audience by modifying a parameter of the [setVideoQuality](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/api/zh-cn/group__V2TXLivePusher__android.html#a2695806cb6c74ccce4b378d306ef0a02) API.

```java 
mLivePusher.setVideoQuality(mVideoResolution, isLandscape ? V2TXLiveVideoResolutionModeLandscape : V2TXLiveVideoResolutionModePortrait);   
```

[](id:step7)
### Step 7. Stop publishing streams
As there can be only one `V2TXLivePusher` object running at a time, make sure that you release all the resources when stopping publishing.
```java
// Stop screen sharing and release the resources
public void stopPublish() {
    mLivePusher.stopScreenCapture();
    mLivePusher.setObserver(null);
    mLivePusher.stopPush();
}
```

## Event Handling

### Listening for events
The SDK listens for publishing events and errors via the [V2TXLivePusherObserver](http://doc.qcloudtrtc.com/group__V2TXLivePusherObserver__android.html) delegate. See [V2TXLiveCode](https://liteav.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/api/zh-cn/group__V2TXLiveCode__android.html) for a detailed list of events and error codes.

### Errors
An error indicates that the SDK encountered a serious problem that made it impossible for stream publishing to continue.

| Event ID | Code | Description |
| :------------------------------------ | :---- | :------------------------------- |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_FAILED                  | -1 | A common error not yet classified |
| V2TXLIVE_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER       | -2 | An invalid parameter was passed in during API calling. |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_REFUSED                 | -3 | The API call was rejected.  |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED           | -4 | The API cannot be called.  |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_INVALID_LICENSE         | -5 | Failed to call the API due to invalid license.  |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_REQUEST_TIMEOUT         | -6 | The server request timed out.  |
|V2TXLIVE_ERROR_SERVER_PROCESS_FAILED   | -7 | The server could not handle your request.  |

### Warnings
A warning indicates that the SDK encountered a problem whose severity level is warning. Warning events trigger tentative protection or recovery logic and can often be resolved.
