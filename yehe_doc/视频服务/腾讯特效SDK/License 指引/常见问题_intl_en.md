This document answers questions you may encounter when using Tencent Effect licenses.

### What is the relation between a license, license key, and the Tencent Effect SDK?
To legally use the Tencent Effect SDK (**“Tencent Effect”** or **“SDK”**), you will need to obtain Tencent’s express permission. This permission is called a license and is usually contained in the terms and conditions that you will need to agree to before you may purchase and/or use the SDK. Without a license, your use of the SDK will be unauthorised and will constitute infringing use. There are 2 types of licenses that you can obtain, a trial license and a production license. 

Once you have obtained a license from Tencent to use the SDK, you will need a valid **license key** to access and use the SDK. This license key consists of a key and license URL (also known as a path) that enables you to access and use the features of the SDK. Without a license key, you will not be able to use the SDK.

Finally, the SDK is a collection of software development tools that facilitate your creation of applications for different software packages, software frameworks, and operating systems.

### What is the validity period of a license? How do I renew it after expiration?
- **Trial license**: A trial license is valid for 28 days after issuance. For example, if you applied for a trial license on January 1, 2022, and it was issued to your account on January 2, 2022, the license would expire at 00:00:00 on January 31, 2022.
- **Production license**: A production license is valid for a year (365 days) after issuance. For example, if you applied for a production license on January 1, 2022, and it was issued to your account on January 2, 2022, the license would expire at 00:00:00 on January 3, 2023.

### How do I upgrade or downgrade a Tencent Effect license?
The Tencent Effect SDK comes in [11 editions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45371). After your existing license expires, you can purchase a different package that better suits your needs. However, you cannot downgrade or upgrade a license within its validity period.

A trial license gives you access to S1-04, the most advanced and full-featured edition of the SDK. You can also switch to a production license that better suits your needs during the trial period.
