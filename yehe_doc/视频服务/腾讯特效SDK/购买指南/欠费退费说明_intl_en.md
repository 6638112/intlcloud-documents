## Refund Policy
**Tencent Effect SDK and effect materials are not refundable.** They come with a 28-day trial period, during which you can stop using them at any time if you are not satisfied. Once a purchased license is bound to an app, the SDK cannot be refunded. Effect materials cannot be refunded either, as they cannot be repossessed once downloaded.

## Overdue Payment Policy
Tencent Effect SDK licenses and effect materials are prepaid. You cannot place an order if there is no sufficient balance in your account.
