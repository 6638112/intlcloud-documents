You can purchase the Tencent Cloud Mobile Live Video Broadcasting (MLVB) SDK independently or together with other cloud services.

- If you wish to purchase just the MLVB SDK, you only need to pay the license fee.
- If you purchase the MLVB SDK together with LVB, you need to pay for the license fee and fees generated by using LVB.

- Currently, Tencent Cloud provides a **free one-time demo** for the basic edition SDK. You can register an account on the [LVB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/license) and apply for the free basic edition SDK license. The free license lasts for 28 days.

## LVB Fees


- If you use the MLVB SDK together with LVB, you need to pay the basic fees generated during live streaming, such as the bandwidth fees, in addition to the SDK license fee. The fees are billed based on the standard LVB billing mode. You can select daily or monthly pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Billing Details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2818).


## Refunds
- If your purchased license is not bound to any package and you do not use LVB, we offer a free 5-day refund for MLVB SDK license fees.

## Arrears

- Arrears do not apply to the license purchase. However, if you purchase other cloud services on the Tencent Cloud platform, you will receive a notification to top-up your Tencent Cloud account balance if it is insufficient. You can top-up your account within 24 hours when your account falls into arrears. If you do not top-up your account within the specified time, you will not be able to log in to the console, which may affect the use of your license.
