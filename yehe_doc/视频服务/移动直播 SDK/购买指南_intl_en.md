- Currently, Tencent Cloud provides a **free one-time demo** for the basic edition SDK. You can register an account on the [LVB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live/license) and apply for the free basic edition SDK license. Please refer to [License Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38546) and then apply for the trial license, which is free of charge for 28 days in total.

- You can purchase MLVB SDK independently or together with other cloud services. If you wish to purchase just the MLVB SDK, you only need to pay the license fee. If you purchase the MLVB SDK together with LVB, you need to pay for the license fee and fees generated by using LVB. If you use the MLVB SDK together with LVB, you need to pay the basic fees generated during live streaming, such as the bandwidth fees, in addition to the SDK license fee. The fees are billed based on the standard LVB billing mode. You can select daily or monthly pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Billing Details](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267/2818).

## Arrears

- Arrears do not apply to the license purchase. However, if you purchase other cloud services on the Tencent Cloud platform, you will receive a notification to top-up your Tencent Cloud account balance if it is insufficient. You can top-up your account within 24 hours when your account falls into arrears. If you do not top-up your account within the specified time, you will not be able to log in to the console, which may affect the use of your license.
