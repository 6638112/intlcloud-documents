### Open-source UI for quick integration

You can quickly implement mobile live streaming solutions by integrating the MLVB SDK into your project for iOS, Android, and web, etc. There are no restrictions on streaming devices.

### Quick publishing

You can use the MLVB SDK together with CSS and use RTMP over QUIC to quickly publish streams to Tencent Cloud at low latency and stuttering rate.

### LEB
Thanks to the use of UDP, the latency of LEB is kept within 1s, as opposed to 3-5s in traditional live streaming. This, along with excellent instant streaming performance and low stuttering rate, guarantees a superior streaming experience.

### Low-latency co-anchoring

Powered by Tencent Cloudâ€™s years of experience in developing audio/video technologies, the MLVB SDK supports real-time audio/video calls and allows co-anchoring between users on different platforms.

### AI technology

MLVB uses AI technologies to enable real-time application of beauty filters and animated stickers, enhancing interaction in different live streaming scenarios.
