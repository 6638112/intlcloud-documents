The MLVB SDK of Tencent Video Cloud Toolkit offers solutions for different use cases for you to get started quickly.

## One-time Events

The MLVB SDK offers stable publishing and playback for streaming scenarios that involve only one or a few channels of live streams, for example, studio filming, live events, and press conferences. It guarantees smooth and clear playback for even outdoor events.


## Live Show Streaming

The MLVB SDK supports streaming on a wide range of platforms, including iOS, Android, PC, browsers, and H5 pages. Hosts can stream anytime with their phones.


## Mic Connect

You can use the interactive live streaming solution provided by MLVB to implement the mic connect feature and enable host- audience interaction and host competition. Live streaming is no longer a one-way communication.


## Live Chat

By using the MLVB SDK together with IM, you can enable audience interaction including on-screen comments, text chat, and like giving.
