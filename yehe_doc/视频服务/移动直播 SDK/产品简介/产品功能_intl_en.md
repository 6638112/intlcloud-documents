### Stream publishing

Tencent Cloud offers UDP acceleration for RTMP streaming. If you use the MLVB SDK together with CSS to publish streams over RTMP, you can enable this feature, which will improve the ability of your service to handle network fluctuations, speed up publishing, enhance playback experience, and reduce overall stuttering. For details, please see [Publishing from Camera](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38157).

### Live game streaming

MLVB allows you to publish streams from the screen of a mobile phone (iOS 8.0/Android 5.0 or above) without using a PC. For details, please see [Publishing from Screen]().


### Playback

MLVB’s powerful player supports protocols including RTMP, FLV, HLS, and WebRTC, allowing you to deliver smooth and clear video to users. For details, please see [Playback (LVB)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/38159) and [Playback (LEB)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/1071/39888).

### Co-anchoring

MLVB supports real-time audio/video co-anchoring, which, unlike the feature used in video calls, is optimized for live streaming to allow one-to-many co-anchoring and interaction.

Co-anchoring is essentially audio/video calls between hosts or between hosts and audience. It improves user interaction during live streaming. You can implement the feature quickly using the MLVB SDK and IM’s room management capabilities. For details, please see [Co-anchoring](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/1071/39888).

### AI-powered beauty filters

MLVB refactored the basic beauty filter module (offered for free). It optimized and merged the skin smoothing feature and filters for improved effects and reduced GPU usage, fixing the heating issue.

In addition, the Enterprise Edition SDK integrates the AI and makeup application technologies of YouTu Lab and Pitu to enable special effects such as eye enlarging, face slimming, nose slimming, animated stickers, AI-based keying, green screen, etc.
