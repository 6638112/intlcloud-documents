### Publishing

This refers to the process in which the host publishes local video and audio to Tencent Video Cloud servers. It is also known as "RTMP publishing" in some cases.

### Playback

This refers to the process of playing audio/video streams via a specified URL after the streams are published to Tencent Video Cloud servers. Since video sources are generated in real time, playback is possible only if streams are being published. Once the host stops streaming, the playback URL becomes invalid. Also, because the streaming takes place in real time, there isnâ€™t a progress bar during playback.

### Publishing domain name

It refers to the domain name used to publish live streams, which is a required setting. You must register a domain name before using it for live streaming. After a publishing domain name is configured, CSS will generate a corresponding publishing URL. For details, please see [How to automatically splice push URLs?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/39359).

### Playback domain name

It refers to the domain name used to play live streams, which is a required setting. You must register a domain name before using it for live streaming. After a playback domain name is configured, CSS will generate a corresponding playback URL. For details, please see [How to automatically splice playback URLs?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/39359).

### UserSig

`UserSig` (user signature) is a security signature designed by Tencent Cloud to authenticate user logins, check whether a user is real, and thus prevent attackers from accessing your Tencent Cloud account. For more information, please see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1071/39471).
