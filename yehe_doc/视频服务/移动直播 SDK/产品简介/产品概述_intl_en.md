## Architecture and Solutions

### Quick integration of MLVB features
You can use the MLVB SDK’s publishing feature together with LVB and LEB to quickly equip your application with the capability to publish live streams at higher quality and faster speed. The SDK supports playback over RTMP, FLV, HLS, and WebRTC, with reduced stuttering and improved watching experience. It’s suitable for a wide range of live streaming scenarios on different platforms.

After activating CSS, you can generate your own publishing and playback URLs in the format required by Tencent Cloud. With publishing and playback URLs, plus the RTMP SDK provided by MLVB that allows **quick integration**, you can quickly equip your application with live streaming capabilities.
