## Architecture and Solutions

### Quick integration of MLVB features
You can use the MLVB SDKâ€™s publishing feature together with LVB and LEB to quickly equip your existing application with the ability to publish live streams with higher quality and at faster speed. You can also use the MLVB SDK to play live streams over RTMP, FLV, HLS, or WebRTC, which can reduce stuttering and is suitable for a wide range of live streaming scenarios on different platforms.

After activating CSS, you can generate your own publishing and playback URLs in the format required by Tencent Cloud. With publishing and playback URLs, plus the RTMP SDK provided by MLVB that allows **quick integration**, you can quickly equip your application with live streaming capabilities.
