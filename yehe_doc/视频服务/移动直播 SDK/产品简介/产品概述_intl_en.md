Co-anchoring
MLVB supports real-time audio/video co-anchoring, which, unlike the feature used in video calls, is optimized for live streaming to allow one-to-many co-anchoring and interaction.
Co-anchoring is essentially audio/video calls between hosts or between hosts and audience. It improves user interaction during live streaming. You can implement the feature quickly using the MLVB SDK and IMâ€™s room management capabilities.
