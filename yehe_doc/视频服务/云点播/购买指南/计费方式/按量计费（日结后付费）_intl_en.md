## Video Storage

#### Pricing
Fees for VOD video storage are charged differently in **Chinese Mainland** and **outside Chinese Mainland**.

Storage price in Chinese mainland: 0.0006 (USD/GB/day)

Storage price outside Chinese mainland: 0.0009 (USD/GB/day)

#### Billing overview

- Rules: Pay-as-you-go. The peak daily storage capacity is used for billing.
- Billing formula: daily storage fee = peak storage capacity (GB) x unit price of corresponding service region
- Billing example: suppose you used VOD storage service outside Chinese mainland on January 1 with a peak storage capacity of 100 GB. You will be required to pay the following fee on January 2:
  VOD storage fee on January 1 = 100 (GB) x 0.0009 (USD/GB) = 0.09 (USD)

>! You can delete stored files via the console to avoid incurring storage fees. Otherwise, storage fees will be incurred every day.

## Video Transcoding
VOD offers three types of video transcoding: basic transcoding, TESHD and [transcoding to adaptive bitrate streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33942).

### Basic transcoding

#### Pricing

Service is priced according to the duration of output files and the resolution range of video height. 

| Codec    | Resolution                            |  Unit Price (USD/min) |
| ---------  |:--------------------------------:|:---------------:|
| H.264      | 4K (Height ≤ 2160 px）          | 0.0521           |
| H.264      | 2K (Height ≤ 1440 px）           | 0.0242          |
| H.264      | FHD (Height ≤ 1080 px）     | 0.0121          |
| H.264      | HD (Height ≤ 720 px)        | 0.0061          |
| H.264      | SD (Height ≤ 480 px)    | 0.003         |
| H.265      | 4K (Height ≤ 2160 px）             |0.2521           |
| H.265      | 2K (Height ≤ 1440 px）           | 0.126           |
| H.265      | FHD (Height ≤ 1080 px）       | 0.063         |
| H.265      | HD (Height ≤ 720 px)       |0.0315         |
| H.265      | SD (Height ≤ 480 px)  | 0.0158          |
|Remuxing| -|0.0028|
|Audio transcoding|-|0.002|


#### Billing overview

- Rules: Fees are billed according to the codec, the length of video height and the duration of output file. Each transcoding task is billed only once according to the specification.
- Billing formula: video transcoding fee = output video duration (min) × transcoding unit price as per codec and resolution (USD/min)

#### Billing example
Suppose you used the VOD to transcode a video whose codec is H.264 on January 1. You transcoded it into two outputs of 2560 × 1440 and 1280 × 640 respectively for 100 minutes, and also transcoded it into an audio file for 100 minutes. You will be required to pay the following fee on January 2:

Transcoding fees on January 1 = 0.0242 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.0061 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.002 (USD/min) x 100 (min) = 3.23 (USD)

>? For the output video with 2560 × 1440 resolution, the height is in the range of 2K (≤ 1440 px) and the unit price is 0.0242 (USD/min ); for the output video with 1280 × 640 resolution, the height is 640 px which is less than 720 px (HD) and greater than 480 px (SD), so the unit price is 0.0061 (USD/min); and unit price for audio transcoding is 0.002 (USD/Minute). The overall fee is the sum of charges for the three tasks.

### Tencent Extreme Speed High Definition (TESHD)
For more information, see [Video Transcoding Service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/7898#teshd).

#### Pricing

Service is priced according to the output file duration and the resolution range of the video height.

|Codec|Resolution|Unit Price (USD/min)|
|----------|-----------|-----------|
|H.264|4K (Height ≤ 2160 px)  |0.1721|
|H.264|2K (Height ≤ 1440 px)|0.08|
|H.264|FHD(Height ≤ 1080 px)|0.04|
|H.264|HD(Height ≤ 720 px)|0.02|
|H.264|HD(Height ≤ 480 px)  |0.01 |
|H.265|4K (Height ≤ 2160 px)|0.8319 |
|H.265|2K (Height ≤ 1440 px)|0.416|
|H.265|FHD(Height ≤ 1080 px)   |0.208|
|H.265|HD(Height ≤ 720 px)  |0.104|
|H.265|SD(Height ≤ 480 px)|0.052|

### Transcoding to adaptive bitrate streaming

#### Pricing

Service is priced according to the output file duration and the resolution range of the video height.
#### Billing overview

**Billing rules are the same as those of the basic transcoding**. Output videos of adaptive bitrate streaming have three specifications and the charges differ as per specification.
#### Billing example

Suppose you used VOD to transcode a video into outputs of adaptive bitrate streaming on January 1. The template contains three output specifications, namely, FHD (1920 × 1080), HD (1280 × 720) and SD (640 × 480), and the transcoded video duration of each output is 100 minutes. You will be required to pay the following transcoding fee on January 2:
Transcoding fee on January 2 = 0.0121 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.0061 (USD/min) x 100 (min) + 0.003 (USD/min) x 100 (min) = 2.21 (USD)

>?  As the original video is transcoded into videos of three specifications, the overall transcoding fee is the sum of charges for the three tasks.


## Video Editing
#### Pricing
- Service is priced according to the codec, duration and resolution of the output file.
- The unit prices as per resolution is the same as those of the [transcoding](#p2).

#### Billing overview
- Rules: Charges are based on the resolution and duration of the output file. **Each video editing task is billed once according to the specification**.
- Billing formula: video editing fee = output file duration (min) × unit price (USD/min) as per resolution and codec

#### Billing example
Suppose you used VOD editing feature to splice video A (10 min, 640 × 480) and video B (15 min, 1280 × 720) on January 1, and the output video is C (25 min, 1280 × 720). You will be required to pay the following video editing fee on January 2:
Video editing fee on January 1= 0.0061 (USD/min) x 25 (min) = 0.1525 (USD)
>? Codec of all videos in above example is H.264. For more information, see [Video Composition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34127) and [[Video Editing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34126).

#### Billing overview
- Rules: daily billing cycle based on the downstream traffic generated when CDN acceleration is used during video playback.
- Billing formula: daily video traffic fee = video playback downstream traffic (GB) × tier traffic unit price (USD/GB)
- Billing example: suppose you used VOD acceleration service on January 1 and the downstream traffic is 550 GB. You will be required to pay the following acceleration fee on January 2:
-   VOD traffic fee on January 1 = 0.038 (USD/GB) * 550 (GB)=14.85 (USD)

## Remarks
If you have a large business volume with storage capacity greater than 1 PB or daily traffic consumption over 10 TB, and the daily billing cycle cannot meet your needs, you can contact sales more flexible and cost-effective billing options.
