## Resource pack（Prepaid）

>?  You can use the [billing example](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/266/38163) to estimate the cost.。

Video-on-Demand provides prepaid packages which refer to the method of pre-purchasing on-demand resources and using the resources later. **Each prepaid resource package only supports the deduction of resources for this billable item.**

## Precautions:

- A package becomes valid immediately after purchase. The validity period is one year. Please pay attention to using it within the resource pack's validity period. After the expiration, the resources in the package will become invalid.
- The packages are only supported for daily-billing account users to purchase and use. If there are packages in the account when the user switches to a monthly-billing account, the packages will be frozen, and their validity will not be extended.
- After the package expires or is exhausted, you are charged for subsequent resource usage on a  [pay-as-you-go (pay after daily settlement)](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/266/14666). To avoid service unavailability due to arrears, please pay attention to the consumption of corresponding packages, purchase new packages in time or ensure that the account balance is sufficient.
- You can purchase multiple packages, but the validity periods of the packages will not be added up. The multiple packages are deducted according to the purchase time.
- The validity period of each resource pack is calculated independently, and the validity periods of multiple resource packs do not overlap.
- The resource package provided by Video-on-Demand can only be deducted from the usage of the corresponding paid service of Cloud On Demand products.
- The resource package supports overseas deduction, and the traffic resource package and storage resource package can be deducted from overseas resources in proportion.
- Resource packs support 5-day no-reason refunds (under specified conditions), see Refund Instructions for details.
- The Video-on-Demand service settles the expenses incurred on the previous day from 12:00 to 18:00 every day, and the resource packs take effect from the day of purchase, so the resource packs purchased on the same day cannot be deducted from the settlement of the day (generated on the previous day usage) cost.
- For resource pack activation and remaining query, please go to the resource pack management of the console under the identity of administrator to check.
