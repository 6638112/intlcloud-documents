For example, suppose a user uses the template with codec set to H.264 and resolution set to HD (1280 × 720) and below, and the component’s published unit price is 0.0061 USD/min.
- Component’s original cost = 0.00610000 × USD/Transcoding type 2/min × 2.00000000 min × 5.00000000 min = 0.03050000 (USD)
