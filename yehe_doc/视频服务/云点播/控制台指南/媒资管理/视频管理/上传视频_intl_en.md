|---------|---------|---------|
| Video Resource URL | Video Name | Video Cover URL|

- TXT file: columns should be separated by commas.
- CSV file: columns should be separated by commas (you can directly fill in the table columns in the CSV file).

>?
>- The columns are video resource URL, video name, and video cover URL, respectively. **Please fill in the columns in sequence.**
>- After the list is parsed, please check whether there are any errors and upload after confirmation.
