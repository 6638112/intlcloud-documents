>- If a domain receives no requests in a day, no logs will be generated, and no data will be displayed.
>- By default, CDN access is logged on an hourly basis. That means 24 log files will be generated at most for a day. No log file will be generated for an hour during which there are no requests.
>- CDN logs may have a delay of about 30 minutes.
