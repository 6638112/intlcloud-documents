## Overview
After you activate VOD, the system will assign you a default domain name (`xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com`). This domain will be used for all your VOD resources by default. You can also add your own domain name in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) (you need to resolve it before use).
## Prerequisites
- You have activated the VOD service. For details, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/39506).
- Your domain must have an ICP filing number if you intend to offer services in the Chinese mainland.

## Adding a Domain Name
1. Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod) and select **Application Management** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the target application.
3. By default, you will enter the **Media Assets > Video Management > Uploaded** page.
2. Select **Distribution and Playback > Domain Name** on the left sidebar, click **Add Domain**, enter the name of your domain, and click **Confirm**.
