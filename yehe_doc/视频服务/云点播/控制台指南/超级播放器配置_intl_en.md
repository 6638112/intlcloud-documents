## Custom Configuration

Log in to the console, select **Distribution and Playback** > **[Superplayer Configuration](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/distribute-play/super-player)**, and click **Create**:
1. Enter the playback configuration name (only **digits** and **letters** are supported).
2. Enter the playback configuration description (up to 15 characters).
3. Select a preset or previously created custom template in **Adaptive bitrate streaming template for playback**.
>?Your player can play back only the videos transcoded through the selected adaptive bitrate streaming template. For example, if the adaptive bitrate streaming template `10` is selected in the playback configuration, then your player can play back only videos transcoded through this template.
4. Select a preset or previously created custom image sprite template in **Image sprite template for thumbnail preview**.
>?Only the image sprites captured through the selected template can be used for thumbnail preview in your player. For example, if the `SpriteScreenShot10` template is selected in the playback configuration, only image sprites captured through the `SpriteScreenShot10` template can be used for preview in your player.
5. Name the substreams for different resolutions for the player in **Definition used for the player to play substreams**. If this configuration item is left empty, the default value will be used. You can customize the video short side length and definition.
6. Click **OK** to complete the creation.

After the configuration is successfully created, it will be displayed in the superplayer configuration list. You can also preview the corresponding configuration as instructed in [Superplayer Preview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33896).
