## Overview
After you activate VOD, the system will assign you a default domain name `xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com`, which will be used by default for all VOD resources. You can also add and resolve a custom domain name in the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview).
## Prerequisites
- You have activated the VOD service. For details, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/39506).
- ICP filing is required for domain names used for business in Chinese mainland.

1. Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod) and click **Distribution and Playback** > **Domain Name** on the left sidebar.
