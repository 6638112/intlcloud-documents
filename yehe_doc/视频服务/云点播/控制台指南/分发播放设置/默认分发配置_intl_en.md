## Overview
After a domain name is added and resolved, you can access your video resources through it; however, the `Host` in a video URL obtained through the API or console remains that in the original domain name. Therefore, you need to log in to the console and update the `Host` information of URL in the default distribution configuration.
## Directions
1. Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) and click **Distribution and Playback** > **Default Distribution Domain** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Edit** in the top-right corner and set the corresponding parameters:
 - Default Distribution Protocol: HTTP and HTTPS are supported.
 - Default Distribution Domain: by default, the system-assigned `xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com` is used. You can also [add](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/35572) and [resolve](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/35572) a custom domain as the default distribution domain.
