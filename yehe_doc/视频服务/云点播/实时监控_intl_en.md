## Access Monitoring
Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod) and click **Data Center** > **Real-time Monitoring** on the left sidebar to enter the management page, which displays the real-time monitoring information. The statistics of all domain names in the last 6 hours are displayed as a line graph at a granularity of 1 minute by default. The statistics include the following metrics:
- Bandwidth: total traffic in one minute divided by 60 seconds.
- Percentage of request status code: percentage chart of status codes (2xx/3xx/4xx/5xx) returned within the selected time period.
- 2xx request status codes: Status codes generated by 2xx status code monitoring will be counted.
- 3xx request status codes: Status codes generated by 3xx status code monitoring will be counted.
- 4xx request status codes: Status codes generated by 4xx status code monitoring will be counted.
- 5xx request status codes: Status codes generated by 5xx status code monitoring will be counted.

### Data on the details page

On the details page, you can view the following data:

- Bandwidth: total peak bandwidth, real-time bandwidth curve, and domain name bandwidth rankings (from large to small)
- Traffic: total traffic, real-time traffic curve, domain name traffic rankings (from high to low), and URL traffic rankings (from high to low)
- Requests: total number of requests, curve of real-time request counts, request count rankings of domain names (from high to low), and request count rankings of URLs (from high to low)
- Status code percentage: pie charts of 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, and 5xx status codes, their counts and percentages
- 2xx status codes: real-time monitoring curve of 2xx status codes and their sub-status codes, as well as 2xx status code rankings of domain names (from high to low)
- 3xx status codes: real-time monitoring curve of 3xx status codes and their sub-status codes, as well as 3xx status code rankings of domain names (from high to low)
- 4xx status codes: real-time monitoring curve of 4xx status codes and their sub-status codes, as well as 4xx status code rankings of domain names (from high to low)
- 5xx status codes: real-time monitoring curve of 5xx status codes and their sub-status codes, as well as 5xx status code rankings of domain names (from high to low)

### Granularity Description

#### Granularity on the overview page

The monitoring page provides options to display data curves at a 1-minute, 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity. The minimum time granularity that can be displayed varies by the selected time period.

- Time period ≤ 6 hours: The minimum time granularity is 1 minute. The latency for the monitoring curve with a 1-minute granularity is about 3 minutes.
- 6 hours < time period ≤ 24 hours: The minimum time granularity is 5 minutes. The latency for the monitoring curve with a 5-minute granularity is about 5–10 minutes.
- 24 hours < time period ≤ 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 hour.
- Time period > 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 day.

#### Granularity on the details page

The time granularity options on the metric details page are as follows:

- Time period ≤ 1 day: The minimum time granularity is 1 minute. The latency for the monitoring curve with a 1-minute granularity is about 5–10 minutes.
- 1 day < time period ≤ 31 days: The minimum time granularity can be 5 minutes, 1 hour, or 1 day.
- Time period > 31 days: The minimum time granularity is 1 day.

>!The 1-minute granularity will be used for query after the new version is released. Currently, the minimum granularity for querying historical data is 5 minutes, and the maximum time period for query is 90 days.

#### Aggregation Description

The method for aggregating 1-minute data into 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day data varies by data metric.

+ Bandwidth: The smallest granularity provided by CDN for monitoring bandwidth data is 1 minute. Based on industry standard, fees are generally billed by 5-minute granularity, which is calculated by taking the average of 1-minute data values. Therefore, the bandwidth data at a 1-hour or 1-day granularity can be calculated based on the maximum 5-minute bandwidth value.
+ Traffic: Traffic data at a 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity is obtained by aggregating 1-minute traffic data.
+ Number of requests and status codes: data at a 5-minute, 1-hour, or 1-day granularity is obtained by aggregating 1-minute data.

### Filter Description
Currently, query by both **Statistical District** and **ISP** is not supported. You can only query all ISPs by district or query all districts by ISP.

## Panel Configuration

The new **Instance Monitoring** page allows you to adjust the metrics panel as needed to view the data curves of desired metrics.

1. Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod) and click **Statistical Analysis** > **Real-time Monitoring** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
2. Click the configuration icon on the right to enter the configuration page.

3. Select data metrics to be displayed on the overview page as needed: Selected metrics will be displayed directly. If you clear a metric, it will no longer be displayed.
   You can customize the panel via real-time monitoring of **Access Monitoring** and **Origin-Pull Monitoring** overview pages.

## Data Comparison

Tabs on the new **Real-time Monitoring** page all support data curve comparison.

1. Log in to the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod) and click **Statistical Analysis** > **Real-time Monitoring** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
2. Query the data curve of a specified time period, click **Data Comparison**, and specify another time period to start data comparison.

   To facilitate your use, the system will automatically fill the start or end time accordingly after you specify the end or start time, ensuring the two time periods for comparison are of the same length.
