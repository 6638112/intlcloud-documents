Tencent Cloud Media Processing Service (MPS) has been serving a wide range of users since its release. To provide better service, MPS simplifies the billing rule of transcoding service, making it easier for users to calculate the fees. The billing rule is adjusted as follows:

**From July 1, 2020, all MPS transcoding billable items (general transcoding, TESHD, video editing, adaptive bitrate streaming, and remux) will be charged according to the short side resolution range of the output video and the video length.**

For example, if on August 1, 2020, you use MPS general transcoding service in the Mumbai region and output a 100-minute video at 1280*640 px resolution using the H.264 codec, the transcoding fee you need to pay on August 2 is calculated as follows:
Transcoding fees = 0.0074 (USD/minute) * 100 (minutes) = 0.74 (USD)

>?You have chosen the general transcoding service and output a video at 1280*640 px resolution. The short side resolution (640 px) of the output video is between 480 px (short side resolution of SD video) and 720 px (short side resolution of HD video). Therefore, you will be charged according to the HD video pricing in Mumbai, i.e., at USD 0.0074 per minute.

The specific unit price can be found in the purchase guide. The unit price in this notice is used as an example only.
Please pay attention to the changes in the billing rule and your balance, and adjust the business in time.
