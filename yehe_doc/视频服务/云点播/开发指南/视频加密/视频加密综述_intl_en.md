**We do not recommend AES encryption due to its relatively low security level.**

* [Hotlink protection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33984) protects your content by blocking or allowing only specified sources of playback requests. However, because the videos are not encrypted, others can still distribute them after they are downloaded, so the security level is not very high.
* With video encryption, your content is encrypted with a key. Even if others have your videos, they cannot play them unless they are authenticated by your backend and issued the decryption key. We recommend [HLS private encryption](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/46780), which offers a higher security level.
