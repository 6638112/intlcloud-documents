### Naming a downloaded file
Normally, if you open the URL of a media file with a browser, instead of downloading the file, the browser will open the file. For example, if you open the URL of a video with a browser, the browser will start playing the video. To download the file, you can add the parameter `download_name` to the query string. This also allows you to name the downloaded file. Here is an example:
```
http://example.vod2.myqcloud.com/dir1/dir2/myVideo.mp4?download_name=[download_name]
```

>- If you enable hotlink protection, download may be subject to restrictions such as a referer allowlist/blocklist or URL expiration time. For details, see [Hotlink Protection Settings](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33984).
>- If a video is encrypted, the transcoding file you download will also be encrypted. You need to decrypt the file first in order to play the video. For details, see [Play back an encrypted video](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38294).
>- For HLS files, you need to download both the index file and segment files. To avoid this, you can transcode an HLS file into MP4.
