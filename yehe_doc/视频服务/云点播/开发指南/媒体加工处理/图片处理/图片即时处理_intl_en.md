Image scaling and cropping have many use cases. For example, images may be scaled to generate thumbnails for media files, and cropping is needed to make square or circular user profile photos. When images are stored in the cloud, traditional editing methods such as locally run software and online editing tools have many disadvantages, for example:
- The process of downloading, editing, and uploading is complicated.
- Manual editing is not efficient and prone to errors.

These pain points can be addressed by VODâ€™s real-time image processing feature.
