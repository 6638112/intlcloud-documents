Cloud video storage, video transcoding service, and video playback acceleration are the core components of Tencent Cloud video solutions.

- **Cloud media storage**
  You can upload or pull media using the VOD console or SDK, store and manage media files, retrieve video information, and create cold storage policies for your media assets.
- **Video transcoding**
  In the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview), you can perform recognition and auditing on the content of your videos. You can also transcode, screenshot, watermark, encrypt, and generate thumbnails for videos.
- **Playback acceleration**
  Leveraging Tencent Cloud's global network of CDN cache nodes, VOD can distribute your audio/video resources to deliver a smooth, multi-channel playback and viewing experience. You can integrate your own or Tencent Cloud's player SDKs with your existing services.
