## Use case
Online education platforms allow students and teachers to attend classes and communicate over the network. These platforms generally have a large number of audio/video teaching resources, most of which are recorded and uploaded by registered teachers. Online education generally involves the following core needs:

    </tr>

        <td>
            Playback on various platforms
        </td>
				<td>
				Students use different many different devices and platforms, including web and mobile clients, and need to be able to watch paid videos on their devices.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Smart subtitling
        </td>
				<td>
				As teachers have different accents and speech rates, and students have different comprehension levels, subtitles need to be added to teaching videos to facilitate the study of all students. However, teaching videos are long, and manual subtitling is inefficient.
        </td>
	</tr>
 <tr>
        <td>
           Copyright protection
        </td>
				<td>
Educational content usually requires dedicated places, professional equipment, and expert teachers, all of which make production costly. As such, teaching videos become important digital assets of the platform, and their copyrights needs to be effectively protected to prevent them from being leaked. The platform also needs to be able to trace pirating users so as to deter piracy and illegal behaviors.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Time shifting
        </td>
				<td>
				Students entering the live classroom may not be able to understand the context of the current teaching content and need to watch the content from an earlier time point to get the context.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Psuedo-live streaming
        </td>
				<td>
				The platform needs to be able to live stream pre-recorded courses at a specified time, so as to encourage students and parents to pay more attention to the courses while reducing the live streaming costs (costs of places, equipment, and teachers) and risks (the recorded video content can be moderated in advance).
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Smart moderation
        </td>
				<td>
				Improper words, behaviors, and images in teaching videos may cause a bad impact on students and bring legal risks and negative opinions to the platform. Therefore, the video content needs to be moderated. However, most teaching videos are long videos, for which traditional manual moderation tends to miss non-compliant content and involves a lengthy process with a low moderation quality and efficiency.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Media playback blocking
        </td>
				<td>
				As teaching videos are mainly oriented to minors, non-compliant video content can be very sensitive. However, such content might fail to be detected due to insufficient performance of the moderation service, and platforms may only find out afterwards that non-compliant was released and needs to be quickly blocked.
        </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
        <td>
            Reduced costs
        </td>
				<td>
				Students demand a high video playback smoothness and definition. However, large numbers of HD videos incur high storage costs.
