            High-resolution video
        </td>
				<td>
			As radio, TV, and OTT platform users generally play back the media on large-screen devices like smart TVs, subtle and vivid details of the video image are required first. Therefore, UHD video playback is the most basic need.

            Smart switch between multiple definitions
        </td>
				<td>
			 Radio, TV, and OTT platforms have a large user base with widely different network conditions. To adapt to different network environments, the platform generally needs to prepare multiple resolutions for a video resource, so that the device can automatically select and play back the media stream at the most appropriate bitrate based on the network conditions.

            Copyright Protection
        </td>
				<td>
			 Radio, TV, and OTT platforms have diverse media resource content, including movies, sports events, animations, and variety shows. As large-screen consumption continues increasing, such content also becomes more prone to piracy. Therefore, effective copyright protection measures are needed to minimize piracy.

            Smart media moderation
        </td>
				<td>
			As radio, TV, and OTT platforms have a wide audience. To prevent severe impact and huge losses due to the release of non-compliant content, efficient moderation capabilities are required. Generally, most of the videos on such platforms have a long duration, which makes the manual moderation process lengthy, inefficient, and error-prone. If machine-based smart moderation is used, a large number of compliant videos can be filtered out first, which greatly reduces the manual moderation costs.

            Media playback blocking 
        </td>

				Media platforms need to be able to quickly block the playback of certain videos if non-compliant content is missed during moderation.

        </td>
				<td>
				Pseudo-live streaming (broadcasting a pre-recorded video to achieve a similar effect to live streaming) widely exists on radio, TV, and OTT platforms. TV shows, variety shows, and interview programs are recorded and edited in advance, and their URLs are placed on the preview page, so that the target audience can favorite the page and URLs in advance and watch them at the scheduled playback time.

            Efficient content cataloging
        </td>
				<td>
				The radio and TV industry has high numbers of videos, most of which are long videos. All of the content needs to be cataloged, but traditional manual cataloging is inefficient.
