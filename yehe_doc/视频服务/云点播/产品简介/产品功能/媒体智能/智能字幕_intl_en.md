## Overview
Smart subtitling can help users automatically generate a subtitle set file for the audio in a media file. This feature is useful for online course recordings, audio/video meeting minutes, and speech quality assurance. Based on advanced speech recognition algorithms and massive amounts of training data, VODâ€™s smart subtitling feature utilizes industry-leading speech recognition capabilities to offer high recognition accuracy, even under various interferences such as ambient and background noise.

## Directions
You can implement smart subtitling through the **full speech-to-text recognition** feature as described in [Video Content Recognition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33946) as follows:
1. [Create an audio/video content recognition template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/37568), enable **full speech-to-text recognition** (`AsrFullTextConfigure`), and specify to generate a subtitle set:
```
{
	"AsrFullTextConfigure": {
		"Switch": "ON",
		"SubtitleFormat": "vtt"
	}
}
```
Get the template ID from the response.
2. With the template ID obtained in step 1, initiate a smart subtitling task as instructed in [Video Content Recognition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33946#.E4.BB.BB.E5.8A.A1.E5.8F.91.E8.B5.B7).
3. Get the task result as instructed in [Video Content Recognition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33946#.E7.BB.93.E6.9E.9C.E8.8E.B7.E5.8F.96).
