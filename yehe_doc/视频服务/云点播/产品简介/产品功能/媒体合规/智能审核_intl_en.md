## Overview
The smart moderation feature can help you effectively recognize non-compliant content such as pornographic and violent images, text in images, speech, as well as sounds. Based on advanced speech, text, and image recognition algorithms and models continuously trained on massive amounts of non-compliant data, VODâ€™s smart moderation feature delivers industry-leading recognition accuracy and recall rate, helping you ensure content compliance.

## Use Cases
As the multimedia industry grows, more diverse content is being produced and distributed at a faster rate. In the meantime, compliance guidelines are also being updated continuously. This has raised new challenges for content hosting platforms regarding moderation:
- **Comprehensive**: The moderation rules must be comprehensive to meet the regulatory compliance requirements without any omissions.
- **Accurate**: Unrelated content is not incorrectly flagged, and accurate details are provided for non-compliant content.
- **Quick**: As large amounts of media content are generated every day, the moderation must be quick so that compliant videos can be released quickly.

Smart content moderation has the following use cases:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Scenario               
        </th>
				<th>
           Description
        </th>
    </tr>
 <tr>
        <td>
            Social media platforms
        </td>
				<td>
            Social media platforms, including forums, short video platforms, and vlogs, are primarily comprised of user-generated content (UGC).<br/>
						<li>Characteristics: Fast update, large quantity, and diverse content.</li>
						<li>Challenges: Users want their content to be released immediately, but traditional manual moderation can hardly satisfy the requirements for quick moderation.</li>
        </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
        <td>
            Live recording
        </td>
				<td>
            Live streams can be delivered again after they are recorded and saved. The sources of live streaming content are diverse, including online education, shopping, and entertainment industries.<br/>
						<li>Characteristics: Long videos, typically several hours or even dozens of hours long. The media content involves trending events in various industries.</li>
						<li>Challenges: The media content is very large in size. Traditional manual moderation tends to miss non-compliant segments and involves a lengthy process with a low moderation quality and low efficiency.</li>
        </td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
        <td>
            Video platforms
        </td>
				<td>
            Professional content production platforms, such as online video portal websites.<br/>
						<li>Characteristics: Long videos with professional production quality.</li>
						<li>Challenges: In traditional manual moderation, non-compliant video segments are labeled by human reviewers, which results in a lengthy moderation process and makes it difficult to release trending videos in time.</br>In addition, misjudgments often occur with manual moderation of professional content, so non-compliant content can still be released and may cause complaints.</li>
