## Overview
Adaptive bitrate streaming allows the video player to automatically switch to the audio/video stream at the most appropriate bitrate based on the user's current network conditions. Under poor network conditions, the video stream at a low resolution will be played back to guarantee the playback smoothness. Under good network conditions, a video stream at a higher resolution will be switched to automatically to fully utilize the bandwidth and deliver an optimal image quality. To implement this feature, you need to output the source audio/video stream as audio/video streams with various specifications (including bitrate and video resolution) and package them to generate an adaptive bitstream file, so that the player can automatically select and play back the bitstream best suiting the current bandwidth.
The adaptive bitrate streaming feature of VOD is industry-leading in terms of feature comprehensiveness and ease of use.

				The communication quality is improved based on network conditions, and multiple definitions are provided for a recorded video, so that the most appropriate definition can be automatically switched to based on the user's network conditions during playback. For important content, users can manually switch the definition. If the bitrate is too high, playback can be paused to let the video buffer.
