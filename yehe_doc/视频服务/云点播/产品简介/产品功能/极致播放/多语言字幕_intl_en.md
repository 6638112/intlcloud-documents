## Overview
VODâ€™s multilingual subtitling feature allows you to associate/unassociate standard multilingual subtitle files with an output file of adaptive bitrate streaming. During playback, users can switch between subtitles in different languages. This feature helps increase cross-border viewer rates, and allows more viewers in target regions to understand and enjoy video content.
Multilingual subtitle sets support various languages, including English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, and Indonesian. For all the supported languages and their corresponding code, see [RFC 5646](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646).

## Directions
Multilingual subtitling support the HLS format for output adaptive bitstreams. Before using this feature, you need to add a subtitle set to the media file and call the [ModifyMediaInfo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/37570) API to add a subtitle set (enter the `AddSubtitles.N` parameter) or delete a subtitle set (enter the `DeleteSubtitleIds.N` parameter). The list of new subtitle sets (`AddedSubtitleSet`, which contains the ID of each subtitle set) will be returned by the API.

After a subtitle set is added to a media file, you can associate/unassociate the subtitle set with the output file of adaptive bitrate streaming by calling the [AttachMediaSubtitles](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/40004) API. You can also initiate an [adaptive bitrate streaming](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/33942) task again. Note that you need to specify the subtitle set ID list in the input parameter of the adaptive bitrate streaming task ([MediaProcessTask](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187#MediaProcessTaskInput) > [AdaptiveDynamicStreamingTaskSet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/34187#AdaptiveDynamicStreamingTaskInput) > `SubtitleSet`).
