## Overview
Upload from client acceleration uses the following methods to provide a higher-quality upload service:
<table ><thead ><tr>
<th style="width:200px">Method</th><th >Description</th></tr>
</thead><tbody ><tr>
<td>Data reception by the nearby edge node</td>
<td>Upload requests from terminals are received by nearby edge nodes deployed globally</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Smart acceleration network</td>
<td>Tencent Cloud's acceleration network is used to intelligently select the optimal linkage to transfer the data to the storage center.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Support for transfer over the QUIC protocol</td>
<td>The QUIC protocol features multiplexing and connection migration, so it has a higher data transfer efficiency and is more stable under poor network conditions.</td>
</tr>

## Use Cases
<table ><thead ><tr>
<th style="width:200px">Scenario</th><th >Description</th></tr>
</thead><tbody ><tr>
<td>Long-distance data upload</td>
<td>As some end users are far away from the VOD storage center, they have a poor upload quality, especially in cross-region and oversea upload scenarios. After upload from client acceleration is enabled, it will use the Tencent Cloud edge node nearest to the end user to receive the userâ€™s requests and will use the acceleration network for data transfer, greatly improving the upload quality.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Data upload under poor network conditions</td>
<td>As mobile client users often switch their network or are in places where the base station signal is weak, the network connection is often unstable and has a high packet loss rate. The upload acceleration feature supports the QUIC protocol to make data transfer more stable under poor network conditions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>General data upload</td>
<td>If a massive amount of data is transferred over HTTP/1.1 through a non-acceleration channel, it can lead to a performance bottleneck. Upload acceleration can upload data over the QUIC protocol and supports features such as multiplexing and 0-RTT to deliver a higher transfer efficiency</td>.
