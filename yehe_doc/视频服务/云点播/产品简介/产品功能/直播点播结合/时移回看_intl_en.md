## Overview
Combining the time shifting feature of CSS and the delivery acceleration capability of VOD, time shifting for live stream playback allows users to rewind and play back earlier parts of a live stream. This is commonly used to play back highlights during live streamed sports events. Users can drag the progress bar to view earlier parts of a live stream, and they can also switch back to continue viewing the currently ongoing live stream.
