## Overview

Tencent Cloud RT-Cube Superplayer for iOS is an open-source Tencent Cloud player component. It can provide powerful playback functionality similar to Tencent Video with just a few lines of code. It has basic features such as landscape/portrait mode switching, definition selection, gestures, and small window playback, as well as special features such as video buffering, software/hardware decoding switching, and adjustable-speed playback. It supports more formats and has better compatibility and functionality than system-default players. In addition, it features instant broadcasting of the first frame and low latency and offers advanced capabilities like video thumbnail.

This document describes Tencent Cloud's proprietary capabilities. Please make sure that you have activated the relevant [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/) services before reading it. If you haven't registered an account, please [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login) first.

## Integration[](id:guide)

This project supports installation through CocoaPods. You only need to add the following code to the `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'SuperPlayer'
```

Run `pod install` or `pod update`.

### Using player[](id:usePlayer)

The main class of the player is `SuperPlayerView`, and videos can be played back after it is created.
```objc
// Import the header file
#import <SuperPlayer/SuperPlayer.h>

// Create a player  
_playerView = [[SuperPlayerView alloc] init];
// Set the delegate to accept events
_playerView.delegate = self;
// Set the parent view. `_playerView` will be automatically added under `holderView`
_playerView.fatherView = self.holderView;
```

```objc
// Hotlink protection disabled
SuperPlayerModel *model = [[SuperPlayerModel alloc] init];
model.appId = 1400329073;// Configure `AppId`
model.videoId = [[SuperPlayerVideoId alloc] init];
model.videoId.fileId = "5285890799710670616"; // Configure `FileId`
[_playerView playWithModel:model];
```
```objc
// To enable hotlink protection, you need to enter the `psign`, which is a signature for superplayer. For more information on the signature and how to generate it, please see https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/42436
SuperPlayerModel *model = [[SuperPlayerModel alloc] init];
model.appId = 1400329071;// Configure `AppId`
model.videoId = [[SuperPlayerVideoId alloc] init];
model.videoId.fileId = "5285890799710173650"; // Configure `FileId`
model.videoId.pSign = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhcHBJZCI6MTQwMDMyOTA3MSwiZmlsZUlkIjoiNTI4NTg5MDc5OTcxMDE3MzY1MCIsImN1cnJlbnRUaW1lU3RhbXAiOjEsImV4cGlyZVRpbWVTdGFtcCI6MjE0NzQ4MzY0NywidXJsQWNjZXNzSW5mbyI6eyJ0IjoiN2ZmZmZmZmYifSwiZHJtTGljZW5zZUluZm8iOnsiZXhwaXJlVGltZVN0YW1wIjoyMTQ3NDgzNjQ3fX0.yJxpnQ2Evp5KZQFfuBBK05BoPpQAzYAWo6liXws-LzU"; 
[_playerView playWithModel:model];
```



Run the code and you can see that the video is played back on the phone and most of the features in the UI are available.


### Selecting FileId[](id:FileId)

A video `FileId` is usually returned by the server after the video is uploaded:

1. After the video is published on the client, the server will return a `FileId` to the client.
2. When the video is uploaded to the server, the corresponding `FileId` will be included in the notification of upload confirmation.

If the file already exists in Tencent Cloud, you can go to [Media Assets](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media), find it, and view its `FileId` as shown below, where ID is the `FileId`:

### Timestamping

When lengthy videos are played back, timestamps on the progress bar can help viewers find the points of interest easily. You can add timestamps by using the `AddKeyFrameDescs.N` parameter in the [ModifyMediaInfo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/37570) API.

After the call is made, new elements will be displayed in the player UI.



### Small window playback[](id:smallWindow)
A small window is a player that floats over the main window within the application. Small window playback is very simple to implement. You just need to call the following code in the appropriate position:

```objc
[SuperPlayerWindow sharedInstance].superPlayer = _playerView; // Set the player for small window playback
[SuperPlayerWindow sharedInstance].backController = self;  // Set the returned view controller
[[SuperPlayerWindow sharedInstance] show]; // Floating display
```

### Exiting playback[](id:exitPlayer)

When the player is no longer needed, call `resetPlayer` to clear the internal state of the player and free up the memory.

```objc
[_playerView resetPlayer];
```
