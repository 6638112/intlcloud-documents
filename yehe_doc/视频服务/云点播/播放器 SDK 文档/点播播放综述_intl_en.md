Tencent Cloud RT-Cube Player is an important component required for connecting you to Tencent Cloud services and building cloud-based integrated capabilities. It provides two types of player for VOD playback scenarios: Superplayer and Superplayer Adapter, which are supported for web, iOS, Android, and Flutter. It can help you quickly deliver a smooth watch experience and provide a high-performance solution that integrates a wide variety of features.
This document describes the differences between different types of player provided by RT-Cube Player and how to use them so as to help you select an appropriate player type.



## Basic Concepts[](id:concept)
### Superplayer
Superplayer supports playback through URL and `FileID`:

      <th width="178px" style="text-align:center">Playback Method</td>
      <th width="0px" style="text-align:center">Description</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td style="text-align:center">Superplayer - playback through URL</td>
      <td>The user plays back videos through URL. This playback method doesn't support FileID-based statistics collection and complex media asset features, and it is usually used in scenarios where no other auxiliary media asset information is required, such as <b>short videos</b> and <b>short-to-medium videos</b>.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>Superplayer - playback through `FileID`</td>
      <td>The user plays back videos through the `FileID` generated by VOD. This playback method provides the capabilities to deeply couple VOD resources with the player SDK, allows you to implement data reporting, monitoring, and complex media asset binding features based on `FileID`, and is usually used in scenarios where other auxiliary media asset information is required, such as <b>long videos</b>.</td>

### Superplayer Adapter
Superplayer Adapter is a player plugin provided by VOD for customers who want to use a third-party or proprietary player to connect to Tencent Cloud PaaS resources. It is generally used by customers who **strongly need to customize player features** and has a certain access threshold, with the same basic features as Superplayer.
