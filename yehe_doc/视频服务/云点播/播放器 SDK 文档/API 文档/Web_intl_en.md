>! Object methods cannot be called synchronously but can be called only after the corresponding events (such as `loadedmetadata`) are triggered, except `ready`, `on`, `one`, and `off`.

## Events
The player can perform event listening through the objects returned by the initialization, for example:
```
var player = TCPlayer('player-container-id', options);
// player.on(type, function);
player.on('error', function(error) {
   // Process
});
```
Here, type is the event type. Supported events include:

| Name | Description |
|------------|---------------------------------|
| play| Playback started. This is triggered when the `play()` method is called or `autoplay` is set to `true` and takes effect. At this time, the `paused` attribute is `false`. |
| playing | Triggered when the playback is paused due to buffering or resumed after pause. The `paused` attribute is `false`. Usually, this event is used to mark that the video playback has actually started, as the `play` event just starts the playback, but the image has not started rendering. |
| loadstart | Triggered when data loading starts. |
| durationchange | Triggered when the duration data of the video changes. |
| loadedmetadata | Metadata for the loaded video. |
| loadeddata | This event is triggered when the data of the current frame is loaded but there is not enough data to play the next frame of the video. |
| progress | Triggered when the media data is obtained. |
| canplay | Triggered when the player is able to start playing the video. |
| canplaythrough | Triggered when the player is expected to be able to continue playing the specified video without buffering. |
| error | Triggered when an error occurs in video playback. |
| pause | Triggered when the video is paused. |
| ratechange | Triggered when the playback speed changes. |
| seeked | Triggered when seeking for the specified playback position ends. |
| seeking | Triggered when seeking for the specified playback position starts. |
| timeupdate | The current playback position has changed, which can be understood as `currentTime` has changed. |
| volumechange | Triggered when the volume is set or the value of the `muted` attribute changes. |
| waiting | Triggered when the playback is paused and the next frame of content is unavailable. |
| ended | Triggered when the video playback ends. In this case, the `currentTime` value is equal to the maximum value of the media resource. |
| resolutionswitching | Definition switching is in progress. |
| resolutionswitched | Definition has been switched. |
| fullscreenchange | Triggered when full screen mode is switched. |
|  webrtcevent | The collection of events during WebRTC file playback. |
|  webrtcstats | The statistics during WebRTC file playback. |


### List of webrtcevent status codes

The player can use `webrtcevent` to get all the events occurring during WebRTC file playback. For example:
```
var player = TCPlayer('player-container-id', options);
player.on('webrtcevent', function(event) {
   // Get the event status code and relevant data from the callback parameter `event`
});
```
The status codes of `webrtcevent` are as listed below:

| Status Code | Callback Parameter | Description |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1001 | None | Stream pull started. |
| 1002 | None | The server was connected. |
| 1003 | None | Video playback started. |
| 1004 | None | Stream pull stopped, and video playback ended. |
| 1005 | None | Failed to connect to the server. Automatic reconnection is enabled. |
| 1006 | None | The obtained stream data is empty. |
| 1007 | localSdp | The signaling server started to be requested. |
| 1008 | remoteSdp | The signaling server is requested successfully. |
| 1009 | None | The stream pull lags and is waiting to be buffered. |
| 1010 | None | The stream pull lagged, and playback ended. |


## Error Codes
When the player triggers an error event, the listener will return an error code. Error codes containing more than 3 digits are for media data APIs. Below is the error code list:

| Name | Description |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| -1 | The player didn't detect an available video address. |
| -2 | Getting video data timed out. |
| 1 | The video data was interrupted during loading. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The network was interrupted. <br><li>The browser was interrupted. <br>Solutions: <br><li>Check the network request information in the network console to confirm whether the network request was normal. <br><li>Restart the playback process. |
| 2 | Failed to load the video due to network problems. <br>Possible causes: the network was interrupted. <br>Solutions: <br><li>Check the network request information in the network console to confirm whether the network request was normal. <br><li>Restart the playback process. |
| 3 | An error occurred while decoding the video. <br>Possible causes: the video data was exceptional and the decoder failed to decode it. <br>Solutions:<br><li>Try transcoding and playing back the video again to troubleshoot problems introduced by the transcoding process. <br><li>Check whether the original video is normal. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting. |
| 4 | The video couldn't be loaded due to unsupported format or server or network issues. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The video data couldn't be obtained, the CDN resource does not exist, or the video data was not returned. <br><li>The current playback environment does not support this video format. <br>Solutions:<br><li>Check the network request information in the network console to confirm whether the video data request was normal. <br><li>Check whether the corresponding playback script for this video format was loaded according to the user guide. <br><li>Check whether the current browser and webpage environment support this video format. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting. |
| 5 | An error occurred while decrypting the video. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The decryption key is incorrect. <br><li>The key requesting API returned exceptionally. <br><li>The current playback environment doesn't support the video decryption feature. <br>Solutions: <br><li>Check whether the key is correct and whether the key API returns normally. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting.<br> |
| 10 | Requesting the VOD media data API timed out. When trying to get the media data, if the player still has no response after 3 retries, this error will be thrown. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The current network couldn't connect to the media data API, or the media data API was hijacked. <br><li>The media data API was exceptional. <br>Solutions:<br><li>Try opening the demo page provided by us to see whether it can play back the video normally. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting. <br> |
| 11 | The VOD media data API didn't return any data. When trying to get the media data, if the player still doesn't receive data after 3 retries, this error will be thrown. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The current network couldn't connect to the media data API, or the media data API was hijacked. <br><li>The media data API was exceptional. <br>Solutions:<br><li>Try opening the demo page provided by us to see whether it can play back the video normally. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting. <br> |
| 12 | The VOD media data API returned exceptional data. When trying to get the media data, if the player still receives unparseable data after 3 retries, this error will be thrown. <br>Possible causes: <br><li>The current network couldn't connect to the media data API, or the media data API was hijacked. <br><li>The playback parameters were incorrect and thus couldn't be processed by the media data API. <br><li>The media data API was exceptional. <br>Solutions:<br><li>Try opening the demo page provided by us to see whether it can play back the video normally. <br><li>Contact technical support and provide playback parameters for troubleshooting. <br> |
