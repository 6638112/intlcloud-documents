## Overview

VOD supports hotlink protection configuration, which allows you to set the validity period, number of viewers, playback duration, etc. This document describes how to use the superplayer to play back a video with hotlink protection enabled.

Before reading this document, make sure that you have read [Stage 1. Play back a video with superplayer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38098) in the Superplayer Guide. This document uses the account activated and the video uploaded in [stage 1](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/266/38098).

## Step 1. Enable hotlink protection

The following takes enabling key hotlink protection for the default distribution domain name under your account as an example:
>!Do not directly enable hotlink protection for the domain name in your production environment; otherwise, playback of videos in the production environment may fail.

1. Log in to the VOD console, select **Distribution and Playback** > **[Domain Name](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/distribute-play/domain)**, and click **Set** in the entry of the default distribution domain to enter the settings page.

2. Toggle **Key Hotlink Protection** on and click **Generate** to generate a random key (2WExxx48eW). Copy the generated key and click **Confirm** to save the configuration and make it take effect.

## Step 2. Preview video playback

In the previous step, you have enabled hotlink protection for the default distribution domain name. Now, you can use the superplayer for web, iOS, and Android to quickly preview video playback.

1. Select **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)**, find the video uploaded and processed in **step 1**, click **Manage** in the **Operation** column, and select **Superplayer Preview**.
2. Select **default** for **Playback Configuration**.
>? **default** is a preset superplayer configuration, which is used to output the adaptive bitstream with template 10 and the image sprite with template 10.

3. As hotlink protection is enabled for the default distribution domain name, you can set the hotlink protection expiration time and the preview duration on the **Playback Control** tab. You can use the default parameter settings here (the default expiration time of playback hotlink protection is one day, and the preview duration and maximum number of IPs allowed for playback are left empty).

## Step 3. Use a demo for verification

After hotlink protection is enabled, the superplayer requires a signature within its validity period to play back the video. You can use the signature tool to quickly generate a signature.

1. Enter the [Superplayer - Signature Generation Tool](https://vods.cloud.tencent.com/signature/super-player-sign.html) page and enter the following parameters:

 * **User appId**: `appId` of video `1400xxx357`(if a subapplication is used, enter the subapplication's `appId`).
 * **Video fileId**: Video `fileId`, which is `528xxx3757278095`.
 * **Current Unix Timestamp**: Current Unix time automatically generated by the tool, which does not need to be entered manually and is `1591516390` here.
 * **Signature Expiration Unix Timestamp**: Signature expiration time, which can be left empty. The signature will expire in one day by default.
 * **Link Expiration Time**: Expiration time of key hotlink protection, which can be set to the hexadecimal Unix time after six hours: `5edcf146`.
 * **Hotlink Protection Key**: Hotlink protection key obtained in the previous step, which is `2WExxx48eW`.

2. Click **Generate Signature**, and the generated signature will be displayed in the "Signature Generation Result" text box.


After getting the superplayer signature, you can use the superplayer demos for [web](https://imgcache.qq.com/open/qcloud/video/tcplayer/examples/vod/tcplayer-vod-base.html), [Android](https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/Player_Android), and [iOS](https://github.com/LiteAVSDK/Player_iOS) for verification. For more information, see the demo source code.
>?In **Media Assets** > **[Video Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/media)** > **Superplayer Preview** in the console, you can get the corresponding web player source code for video preview for your reference.
