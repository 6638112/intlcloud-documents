### What are the relationships between a license, a license key, and the Tencent Effect SDK?

You need a license issued by Tencent Cloud to legitimately use the Tencent Effect SDK. Using Tencent Effect without a license constitutes infringement. There are two types of license available: trial licenses and official licenses.

An SDK is a collection of software development tools that facilitate your creation of applications for specific software packages, software frameworks, or operating systems. When you are issued a license by Tencent Cloud, you will get a license key and a license URL, which you need to pass to the Tencent Effect SDK in order to use its features.

### How do I upgrade or downgrade a Tencent Effect license?

The Tencent Effect SDK comes in 14 editions. To learn about their features, see [Pricing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45371). If you want to change to a different SDK edition, wait till your current license expires and purchase and bind a different package to your application. You cannot change the SDK edition when a license is still valid.

The package offered for trial is the full-featured S1 - 04. You can upgrade to an official license even before your trial license expires.
