- **Purchased materials are valid for one year**. To continue using the materials after they expire, you need to purchase them again.

## Billing Example
Suppose you purchased the basic A series package A1 - 02 and, after passing the review, were issued a license (license A) on January 1, 2022  You later purchased the advanced S series package S1 - 01 and were issued a license (license B) on June 1, 2022 . On the same day, you unbound license A and bound license B to your application.
- License A is valid until 00:00:00 on January 2, 2023. With it, you can use the features of package A1 - 02, including basic beauty filters, image settings, basic beautification, filters, and stickers.
- License B is valid until 00:00:00 on June 2, 2023. With it, you can use features of package S1 - 01, including basic beauty filters, image settings, advanced beautification, filters, stickers, advanced stickers, and makeup effects.

That means from January 1, 2022 to June 1, 2022, **before you unbound license A**, your application can use the features of package A1 - 02 (basic beauty filters, image settings, basic beautification, filters, and stickers). From June 1, 2022 to 00:00:00 on June 2, 2023, **after you bound license B**, your application can use the features of package S1 - 01 (basic beauty filters, image settings, advanced beautification, filters, stickers, advanced stickers, and makeup effects).

After unbinding license A, you can bind it to another application, which can use the features of package A1 - 02 until 00:00:00 on January 2, 2023.
