## Installation
The Tencent Effect web SDK is offered as an npm package.
```
npm install tencentcloud-webar
```

## Integrating the SDK

- We offer two initialization modes for the web SDK.
	- [Built-in camera and player](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/50101): The deviceâ€™s built-in camera and player are used. API calls are easy and fast, with rich interactive features.
	- [Custom streams](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/50102): You can use this mode if you want to apply effects to your own streams or want greater flexibility and control.

>? **The SDK 0.2.1 added support for checking hardware acceleration:**
The Tencent Effect web SDK relies on hardware acceleration to achieve smooth rendering. The SDK allows you to check whether a browser supports hardware acceleration. You can block the browser if it does not support hardware acceleration.
```javascript
import {ArSdk, isWebGLSupported} from 'tencentcloud-webar'

if(isWebGLSupported()) {
	const sdk = new ArSdk({
		...
	})
} else {
	// The browser blocking logic
}
```
