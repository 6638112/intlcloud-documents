## Trial Licenses for Mobile Applications

### Applying for a trial license[](id:create_test)

You can apply for a trial license to try out the Tencent Effect SDK. A trial license is valid for 14 days and can be renewed once (28 days in total).
The Tencent Effect package offered for trial is the full-featured [package S1 - 04](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45376). You can also choose specific features of the Tencent Effect SDK to try. Note that package S1 - 04 includes X1-01 keying, but does not offer other keying features.

>! **You need to pass our review before you are issued a Tencent Effect license**. A trial license becomes valid the moment you pass our review. If you renew the trial license after the first 14 days, the new expiration time of the license will be 14 days from the time of renewal.
>- After you submit your company information, the status of the Tencent Effect module will change to **Review in progress**. The review process usually takes 1-2 days. Suppose you submitted your company information on `2022-05-24 12:47:33`  and passed the review on `2022-05-24 15:23:46`. The trial license would expire 14 days later on `2022-06-09 00:00:00`.
>- You can renew the trial license once for free. If you renew it within the first 14 days, it will expire on `2022-06-23 00:00:00` ); if you renew it after the first 14 days, for example, on `2022-08-06 22:26:20`, it will expire on `2022-08-22 00:00:00` .

In the console, you can either **create a trial license for a new application** or **activate Tencent Effect for trial for an existing application**.
