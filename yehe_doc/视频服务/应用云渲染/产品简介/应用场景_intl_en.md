## All-real internet
For online events such as virtual meetings, exhibitions, and other virtual spaces,  you can integrate CAR to allow users to conveniently experience your metaverse events.

## Marketing
You can render products in a 3D application to create a dedicated virtual marketing space for online marketing events. CAR allows users to access your application content conveniently through a mobile or desktop webpage, so they can experience large-scale 3D applications through a video stream with no need to install it on their device.

## New media
CAR helps businesses upgrade their media content and present 3D images for trending news or other content. The content can then be delivered through mobile web pages or other platforms where users can easily view it on their own devices and share it with others.
