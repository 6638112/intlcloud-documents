## Real-Time Cloud Rendering
Real-Time Cloud Rendering runs your application client (application with an engine such as UE or Unity) on a cloud computing resource with GPU and enables users to access the cloud application through a video stream.

## CAR concurrency
In CAR, a concurrency represents the collection of virtual computing resources, including CPU, bandwidth, disk, and GPU, required for one user to render your application content. When you purchase a concurrency pack, you can select the resources and the number of concurrencies. Each concurrency supports one user to access your application. Currently, concurrency packs are prepaid in a monthly or daily subscribed manner.

## Application upload
In the CAR console, you can upload your application and perform operations such as update and version management.

## Project management
A project is a direct management object for Real-Time Cloud Rendering maintenance. A project needs to be associated with an application, and you can allocate a concurrency pack to a project based on your business needs.
