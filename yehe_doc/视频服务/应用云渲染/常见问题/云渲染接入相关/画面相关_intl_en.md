### What encoding formats are used?
CAR uses H.264 encoding by default. In scenarios supporting H.265, it will use both H.265 and H.264 encoding in an adaptive manner.

### Why is the displayed window image incomplete?
You can troubleshoot as follows:
Check whether only one application is started and whether the window size exceeds the desktop size.
Check whether a process with the same class name and window name as those of the specified application existed during startup. The temporary process might be captured.
