In CAR, users access your application by connecting to concurrencies. Each concurrency supports access by only one user at a time. If you want your business to sustain 100 concurrent online users, you need to purchase 100 concurrencies.
To purchase and manage concurrencies for your application, you need to purchase a concurrency pack. Concurrency packs are configured with resources and concurrencies, and can then allocated to your projects.

### Directions
1. Go to the [CAR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/car).
2. Click **Concurrency management** on the left sidebar and click **Buy concurrency pack** on the **Concurrency management** page.
