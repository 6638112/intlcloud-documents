CAR provides the self-service application upload feature. You can package your application as a ZIP/RAR file and upload it from the local system or through a URL to deploy it as a cloud application.

## Directions
1. Go to the [CAR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/car).
2. Click **Application management** on the left sidebar and click **Create application** on the **Application management** page.
3. In the **Create application** pop-up window, select an upload method. You can select a file, drag a file, or enter a URL to upload a file.
>? The download URL must be a URL that can be accessed and trigger download directly. Download URLs of cloud disks or other URLs requiring verification are not supported.


4. After you submit the application upload task, you can click **Startup parameters**.
5. You can view the application upload progress for a selected or dragged file in **Upload task** in the top-right corner.

An application uploaded through a URL will be downloaded on the backend. You can directly view the **application creation progress** in the upload task list on the **Application management** page.
