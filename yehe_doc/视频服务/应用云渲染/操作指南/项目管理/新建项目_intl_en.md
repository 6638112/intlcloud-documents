A project is the unique credential for scheduling in CAR. A project will be associated with an application, and you can allocate a concurrency pack to the project. Simply with an application (content) and a concurrency pack (computing power), you can enjoy the CAR service.

## Directions

1. Go to the [CAR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/car).
2. Click **Project management** on the left sidebar and click **Create project** on the **Project management** page.
3. On the **Create project** page, set the following configuration items:
<table>
