A project is the unique credential for scheduling in CAR. After you have uploaded an application, you need to associate it with a project, and then you can allocate a concurrency pack (computing power) to your project, after which you can enjoy the CAR service.

## Directions

1. Go to the [CAR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/car).
2. Click **Project management** on the left sidebar and click **Create project** on the **Project management** page.
