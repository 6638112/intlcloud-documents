Before reading this document, you need to understand the [basic concepts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1158/49600) of CAR.

## Prerequisites
Before purchasing a CAR concurrency pack, you need to perform the following steps:
1. Sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.tencent.com%2F).
2. Submit a [CAR integration application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/ombzi6237bn).

## Directions
1. After the application is approved, enter the [CAR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/car).
2. Go to the **Concurrency management** page, click **Create**, and set the configuration items as follows:

<table>
<tr><th style="width: 23%;">Configuration Item</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Application type</td>
<td>Cloud 3D by default.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Project</td>
<td>Allocate the concurrency pack to one of your projects, or select **To be allocated** to allocate it later. <b>After the concurrency pack is allocated to a project, you can still transfer it to another project later.</b></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Billing mode</td>
<td>Select the billing mode for the concurrency pack. Currently, CAR supports two prepayment modes: monthly and daily.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Region</td>
<td>Select the region of the concurrency pack based on the region of your business to ensure the optimal cloud rendering and operation experience.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Concurrency scale</td>
<td>Select the concurrency scale based on the concurrency scale you configured for your application. For more information on the supported concurrency scales, see Concurrency Scales.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Quantity</td>
<td>Select the number of concurrencies (i.e., the max number of users that can concurrently access your application). Each concurrency supports access by only one user at a time. You can select the number of concurrencies you want based on the peak and average numbers of concurrent users than you expect to access your application.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Duration</td>
<td>Select the amount of time that the CAR concurrency pack will be used.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Auto-renew (optional)</td>
<td>When <b>Auto-renew</b> is enabled, your concurrency pack will be automatically renewed monthly upon expiration if your Tencent Cloud account balance is sufficient. <b>Note: Concurrency packs billed on a daily basis don't support automatic renewal.</b></td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Pack name</td>
<td>Name the CAR concurrency pack.</td>
</tr></table>

3. After completing the above configuration, confirm that everything is correct and click **Buy Now**.

5. After making the payment, click **Go to the console** to manage your CAR concurrency pack.
