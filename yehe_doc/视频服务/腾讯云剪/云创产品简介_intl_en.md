You can create and manage a tree of independent categories for every user and team, which function similarly to file directories and allow multi-level management. Media materials can be imported and exported via different methods. For example, you can upload a local file, pull content via URL, or import materials from VOD or recorded live streams or via APIs. Breakpoint resumption and large file uploading are supported too to meet needs in different scenarios. The materials managed can be imported to Cloud Video Editor for quick editing without the need for uploading or transcoding.
The file formats supported are:

- Video: MP4, TS, FLV, WMV, ASF, RM, RMVB, MPG, MPEG, 3GP, MOV, WEBM, AVI
- Audio: MP3, M4A, FLAC, OGG, WAV
- Cover image: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, AI, CDR, and EPS
