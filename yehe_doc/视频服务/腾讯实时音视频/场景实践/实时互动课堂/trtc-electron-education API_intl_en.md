The `trtc-electron-education` component is a secondary encapsulation of TRTC and IM capabilities used in real-time interactive teaching scenarios. In addition to basic audio/video chat and screen sharing capabilities, it also offers various teaching features such as Q&A, raise hand, invite, and end answering for online education scenarios.
`trtc-electron-education` is an open-source npm component depending on two closed-source Tencent Cloud SDKs. For the specific implementation process, please see [Real-Time Interactive Teaching (Electron)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/37278).
* TRTC SDK: the [TRTC SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647) is used as the low-latency audio/video call component.
* IM SDK: the [IM SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047) is used to send and process signaling messages.
