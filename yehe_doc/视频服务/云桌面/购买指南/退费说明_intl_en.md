- Monthly subscription (prepaid): Each account is entitled to one unconditional full refund within five days of purchasing a CVD instance. Non-full refunds will be provided for other refund requests.
- Pay-as-you-go (postpaid): CVD resources are automatically returned when not in use. You don’t need to request a refund.
You can return instances in the desktop list in the [CVD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvd) in a self-service manner.

To help you use CVD more easily, if you are dissatisfied after purchasing a monthly subscribed CVD instance, you can return it within five days for an unconditional refund. The five-day unconditional refund is available **only once for one CVD instance**. The payment amount will be refunded to your Tencent Cloud account. In addition, you can also perform a standard return. In this case, fees for consumed resources will be deducted from the refund, and **the refund amount will be returned to your account according to the proportion of cash and free credit used to make the payment.**
>!
>- Discounts and vouchers will not be returned.
>- The refund amount will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account.

## Notes
- After a CVD instance is created, you cannot **terminate/return its management unit or disks separately**.
- Currently, CVD doesn't have a recovery mechanism. After an instance is terminated/returned, **all its cloud disk data will be cleared and cannot be recovered. Before you terminate/return an instance, ask your end users to back up their data**.

## Five-Day Free Returns
After purchasing a monthly subscription, if you are dissatisfied with our service, you can request a free refund within five days of purchase. Below are the details of our five-day unconditional refund policy:
- You can return one monthly subscribed CVD instance unconditionally within five (included) days after purchase.
- For an order that meets the five-day unconditional return policy, the refunded amount is the total amount paid at the time of purchase, including cash, commission, and free credit amounts.
- We may reject a refund request if we suspect refund abuse.

## Standard Returns
For orders that are not eligible for the five-day unconditional return policy, the refund policy is as follows:
* After you return a CVD instance and its status becomes **Terminating** or **Terminated**, it will no longer incur any compute or storage resource fees.
* When you return a monthly subscribed instance, fees are deducted from the refund amount based on how long you have used the desktop. For the portion of usage duration that spanned an entire month, the prices and discounts for monthly packages will apply; for additional usage, the pay-as-you-go rates will apply. Refund amount = Paid amount - (Number of whole months used x Monthly subscription price x Discount multiplier) - (Additional usage duration x Pay-as-you-go rate x Discount multiplier).
* If the refund amount of a monthly subscribed CVD instance is less than or equal to 0, the resources will be released without any money returned to your account.
* For a returned pay-as-you-go instance, fees will be charged based on the actual usage upon return (with the usage duration accurate down to the second).
* You can return up to 199 monthly subscribed CVD instances under each account in the console.

## Return Examples
>! The following prices are for demonstration purposes only and do not reflect the actual pricing shown on the official website. If you make a return, the actual unit prices at the time of purchase shall apply, which may vary by region, promotional campaign, or policy.

### Scenario
| Region | Compute Resources | Storage Resources | Billing Mode | Applicable Discount |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Hong Kong | CVD - Graphic G1_4-core 16 GB | 100 GB SSD system disk and 200 GB premium data disk | Monthly subscription | 15% off |

Order amount = CVD - Graphic G1_4-core 16 GB + 100 GB SSD system disk + 200 GB premium data disk = 296.88 USD + 15 USD + + 17 USD + 70 USD = 338.88 USD.
Paid amount = 338.88 USD x 1 month x 0.85 = 288.048 USD

#### Five-day free return
Suppose you are not satisfied with the CVD instance and want to return it within five days after purchase, and this is your first time returning an instance.
The refund amount will be the actual payment amount, i.e., 288.048 USD.

### Standard return
Suppose you have used the instance for 48 hours and want to return it due to business changes. Although it’s within five days of purchase, this is not your first time returning an instance. Your account has not reached the standard refund limit (199 instances).
Refund amount = 288.048 USD - 48 hours x 0.97 USD/hour x 0.85 = 248.472 USD.  

>? 0.97 USD/hour is the unit price for a pay-as-you-go instance of the same specification, including compute and storage resources.
