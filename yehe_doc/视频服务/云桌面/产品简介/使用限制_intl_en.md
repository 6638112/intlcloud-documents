## Available regions
Currently, CVD is only available in Hong Kong, China. We will offer services in more regions in the future. To request CVD services in your region, please contact your sales representative.

## Instance quota
You can purchase up to 100 CVD instances (including up to five graphic instances) with each account in each region. If you need more, please contact your sales representative.

## Policy quota
You can create up to 10 custom CVD policies with each account. If you want to create more, please contact your sales representative.

## Default port (80)
Because CVD communicates with backend management units over port 80, please avoid using this port for the applications in a virtual desktop; otherwise, end users may fail to connect to the desktop.

## VPN usage
Using VPN and firewall tools in CVD may cause connection errors. Ask end users to avoid using such tools if possible.

## Network configuration
Ask end users not to disable the ENI or change the route in CVD; otherwise, CVD cannot be connected.

## Data saving
Ask end users to save data regularly when using the cloud desktop to avoid losses caused by accidental data loss and corruption.
