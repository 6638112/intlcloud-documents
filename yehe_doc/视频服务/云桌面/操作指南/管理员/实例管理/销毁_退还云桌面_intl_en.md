## Overview
You can terminate a CVD instance in the following two ways:
- Manual termination: Monthly subscribed or pay-as-you-go CVD instances can be manually terminated/returned before expiration.
- Automatic termination upon expiration/overdue payment: Monthly subscribed CVD instances will be automatically terminated and released upon expiration.

>! Ask users to back up their data before you terminate/return a CVD instance.
