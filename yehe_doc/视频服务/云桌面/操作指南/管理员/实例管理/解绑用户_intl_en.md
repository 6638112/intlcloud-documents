## Overview
You can unbind a CVD instance from the user, after which the binding status of the CVD instance will become **None**. Then, you can bind the CVD instance to another user or the original user.
>!
- You can unbind only CVD instances in **Running** or **In use** status from users.
- If a CVD instance in **In use** status is unbound from the user, the current CVD connection session will be closed. Ask the user to back up their data first.
- After unbinding, the user can no longer log in to the instance. Ask the user to back up their data first.
