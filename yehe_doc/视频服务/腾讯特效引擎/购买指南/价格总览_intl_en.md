## Billing Description

- One license can be bound to one `Bundle ID` and one `Package Name`. The package name bound to a production license cannot be modified. If you need to connect multiple package names, you need to purchase the corresponding number of licenses for binding.
- A license is valid for one year. After it expires, you need to purchase a new package for renewal; otherwise, the corresponding features will become unavailable.
- **Shadow package description**: you can have two shadow packages if you purchase a package at the price of 65,000 USD or higher. To use a shadow package, contact sales to reach the product team for manual package issuance. During issuance and authorization, provide the names of both the shadow package and production package. If your business needs more shadow packages, one additional shadow package name will cost 5,000 USD.
- **Materials are valid for one year**. After you renew a license, you can continue to use the complimentary materials.
- **The purchased materials can only be used under the license used to purchase them.** Any form of material exchange is prohibited, including but not limited to gifting, resale, and renting. Tencent Cloud reserves all legal rights to hold violators accountable.



## Billing Example

You purchased the basic A series package A1 - 02 and obtained the approved license A on January 1, 2022. You will purchase the advanced S series package S1 - 01 and obtain the approved license B on June 1, 2022. Your package name will be unbound from license A and bound to license B on June 1, 2022. Then:

- License A will be valid until 00:00:00 on January 2, 2023 and include basic beauty filters, image adjustment, basic shaping, filters, and stickers of the basic A series package.
- License B will be valid until 00:00:00 on June 2, 2023 and include basic beauty filters, image adjustment, advanced shaping, filters, stickers, advanced stickers, and makeups of the advanced S series package.

The app under your package name can use the features (basic beauty filters, image adjustment, basic shaping, filters, and stickers) in the basic A series package A1 - 02 from January 1, 2022 to June 1, 2022 **before it is unbound from the original license**. It will be able to use basic beauty filters, image adjustment, advanced shaping, filters, stickers, advanced stickers, and makeups in the advanced S series package S1 - 01 after **it is bound to the new license** on June 1, 2022 till 00:00:00 on June 2, 2023.

The unbound license of the basic A series package A1 - 02 can be bound to another app that is not bound to any license and will be valid until 00:00:00 on January 2, 2023.
