### What is the relation between a license and the Tencent Effect SDK?
A license offers the key and path to the features of the SDK, while an SDK is a collection of software development tools that facilitate your creation of applications for different software packages, software frameworks, and operating systems. A license consists of a key and a license URL. Provide them to the Tencent Effect SDK and you can access its features.

### How do I upgrade or downgrade a Tencent Effect license?
The Tencent Effect SDK comes in [10 editions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1143/45371). After your existing license expires, you can purchase a different package that better suits your needs. However, you cannot downgrade or upgrade a license within its validity period.

A trial license gives you access to S1-04, the most advanced and full-featured edition of the SDK. You can also switch to a production license that better suits your needs during the trial period.
