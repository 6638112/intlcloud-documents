### What should I know about the license? 

The UGSV SDK is available in Basic Edition and Enterprise Edition. Starting v4.5, a license is required. Basic Edition requires only the UGSV license (`TXUgcSDK.licence`), while Enterprise Edition also requires the Pitu license (`YTFaceSDK.licence`) in addition. You can place the licenses into the project directory and rename them accordingly.

Starting v4.9, the license usage has been changed. You can select whether to package the license into the project. When using the license, you need to call the `setLicenceURL:key:` API to set the license URL and key.
>!The SDK 4.5â€“4.7 does not support automatic license renewal, which is supported on v4.9 and above. SDK 4.9 is compatible with licenses on lower versions (you cannot pass in `null` for `url` and `key`; if needed, you can pass in a random string for them); however, licenses on higher versions cannot be used on SDK versions below 4.9.

### What should I know about TXUGCPublish.h?

Starting v4.5, `TXUGCPublish` classes have been moved to the demo layer from the SDK. If you need to use such classes, you can directly drag the `VideoUpload` directory into your project.

### What should I do if an error was reported when I directly ran the demo in Xcode?

You need to select the corresponding target as shown below:

### What should I do if a short video shoot error was reported when I connected to Xcode for debugging?

The short video shoot error `Main Thread Checker: UI API called on a background thread` may be reported when Xcode is connected to for debugging.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/04b272c456b0e69239c0867a8e964d7a.jpg)
The reason is that some APIs (generally related to UI) need to be called in the main thread. If they are not called in a main thread and `Main Thread Checker` is checked, the error will be reported.

Solution: select `Product` > `Scheme` > `Edit Scheme` > `Run` > `Diagnostics` and uncheck `Main Thread Checker`.
>?This issue has been fixed on v4.9.


<span id="que5"></span>
### What should I do if I could not find the header file when using the SDK?

- Add the header file search path in `Build Settings` > `Search Paths` > `Header Search Paths`.
- Use the `"TXLiteAVSDK_UGC/XXX.h"` method to import the SDK header file.
- Use the `@import TXLiteAVSDK_UGC;` method to import the SDK (on v5.0 or above).

You can choose one of the above methods as appropriate.



<span id="que6"></span>
### What should I do if category methods failed to be found or the project crashed during project execution?

The SDK uses some category methods. To load them, you need to add `-ObjC` in `Build Settings` > `Linking` > `Other Linker Flags` in the project.

### What should I do if the background music set for short video shoot did not work?

1. Check whether the file exists in the background music path passed in and whether the file can be played back normally.
2. Check whether the APIs are called in the following sequence: `startCameraSimple:preview:` > `setBGM:` > `startRecord`.

>!Many APIs need to be called in certain sequence; otherwise, they will not work. Generally, such requirement is specified in the comments.
For example, APIs such as `setVideoResolution:`, `setVideoBitrate:`, and `setAspectRatio:` for short video shoot can take effect only if they are set before `startRecord`.


<span id="que8"></span>
### Can the background music set for shoot be looped?

Currently, loop playback is not supported.


<span id="que9"></span>
### Why wasn't the completion callback returned at the time specified by `endTime` when I set the background music for shoot?

If the `endTime` is smaller than the total music file duration, in SDK 4.6 or below, the completion callback will be triggered only after the playback of the background music is completed; in SDK 4.7 or above, the completion callback will be triggered at the time specified by `endTime`.


<span id="que10"></span>
### Why is it slow when the camera is enabled for the first time for shoot?

It will take a relatively long time to enable the camera on an iPhone for the first time, as cold startup is used, and it will be the same case even if you enable the camera through a system API.

The reason is that it is not suitable to enable the camera in a child thread. Tests show that it will take more time if the camera is enabled in a child thread. Moreover, if the camera is consecutively enabled and disabled in the main thread, the response delay of the child thread will also increase, degrading the user experience.

### How do I implement shoot resumption?

When the first shoot is completed, do not call `stopRecord` and `stopCameraPreview` (otherwise, the shoot will stop, and you can only start a new shoot). You can call `pauseRecord`, use `TXUGCPartsManager.getVideoPathList` to get the shot video segments, and use `TXVideoJoiner.joinVideo` to compose the final video (on versions below 4.5). You can also directly call `TXUGCPartsManager.joinAllParts` to compose the final video more quickly (on v4.5 or above). In this way, when you resume shoot, all the shot video segments exist, and you can continue the shoot.


<span id="que12"></span>
### What should I do if the completion callback could not be received when short video shoot was completed?

- Check whether `stopRecord` is called. Only after `stopRecord` is called can the completion callback be returned.
- Check whether the functions are called in the main thread.

### Audio could not be recorded during the shoot when I used another player to play back a video and then returned to the shoot process. What should I do?

The `AudioSession` on iOS is shared by all audio/video applications. If you use another player for playback, the `AudioSession` will be occupied. If `AudioSession` is not released at all or promptly when the playback ends, that of the shoot module will become invalid. The SDK provides two APIs: `-(void) pauseAudioSession` and `-(void) resumeAudioSession`. You can call `pauseAudioSession` first before you use another player for preview and then call `resumeAudioSession` before you continue the shoot.



<span id="que14"></span>
### What should I do if the shot video is blurry?

The shot video will be blurry if the bitrate and resolution do not match. You can increase the bitrate accordingly and enable the B-frame feature to improve the image quality.



<span id="que15"></span>
### What should I do if the video failed to be generated after I switched the application to the background and then to the foreground during video editing?

Hardware encoding (featuring higher encoding efficiency and image quality) is used by default for video generation. However, the hardware encoder will stop running if the application is switched to the background, resulting in video generation failure. The SDK provides two APIs: `pauseGenerate` and `resumeGenerate`. When the application is switched to the background, you can call `pauseGenerate` to pause video generation; when the application returns to the foreground, you can call `resumeGenerate` to resume video generation.

>!If `resumeGenerate` is called, the SDK will restart the hardware encoder, which may fail. Plus, the hardware encoder may fail to encode the first several frames after the restart. In this case, the SDK will throw the `TXVideoGenerateListener` error event internally, and the video needs to be generated again after the error event is received.

### What should I do if file upload failed?

The file upload status codes are as detailed below:

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/555615a2b4ee9277d10a1258750635dc.png)
1. Check whether the file to be uploaded is in the local sandbox. If you want to upload a file in the media library, you need to copy it to the local sandbox first.
2. If error code 1002 is returned, the signature is exceptional, the timestamp has expired, or the VOD service is exceptional (unactivated or suspended).
3. If error code 1003 is returned, a request parameter is exceptional or the format of the file to be uploaded is not supported.

### Does short video shoot support photo capturing?

The UGSV SDK supports photo capturing. You can simply call the `snapshot` API of the `TXUGCRecord` class to get an image after preview starts.
