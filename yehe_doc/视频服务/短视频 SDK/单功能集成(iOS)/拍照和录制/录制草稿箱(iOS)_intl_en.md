How the shooting drafts feature works
#### Starting a shooting
1. Start shooting a video.
- Pause/End the shooting. 
- Cache the video segment locally (draft box).

#### Resuming the shooting
1. Preload the locally cached video segment.
- Continue with the shooting.
- End the shooting.

//Set `videoPathList` to a local path.

//Preload the locally cached video segment.

//Start the shooting
[record2 startRecord];

//End the shooting. The SDK will splice together the two video segments.
