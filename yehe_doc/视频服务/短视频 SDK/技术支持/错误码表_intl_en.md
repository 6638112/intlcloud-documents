## Uploading

### SDK Error Codes

The UGSV SDK listens for publishing-related events through the `TXRecordCommon.ITXVideoPublishListener` API. Therefore, you can check the publishing status of videos from `retCode` in `TXRecordCommon.TXPublishResult`.

| Code | Event Definition                       | Description                                   |

>? If error codes 1003 and 1004 are returned, troubleshoot the problems according to the error messages (`errMsg`) returned. To handle COS errors, see [Troubleshooting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31517).

### Server Error Codes  

If you are unable to determine the result of video publishing using the SDK error codes, check for the following error codes returned by the server, which can be found in the log.
