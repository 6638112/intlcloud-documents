## AI-Powered Beauty Filters
The basic beauty filter module is offered for free. We have redesigned the skin smoothing and other beauty filters of the module to deliver better effects. The GPU usage has also been lowered, which reduces overheating.

The Tencent Effect SDK leverages the AI and beauty filter technologies of YouTu Lab and Pitu to support special effects such as eye enlarging, face slimming, and nose narrowing. It also offers dynamic stickers and supports AI keying. You can use the Tencent Effect SDK together with the UGSV SDK.
