The user-generated short video (UGSV) sector has boomed in recent years. Thanks to innovation on both content and app features, UGSV has become the next hotspot after live streaming. To help you quickly build and launch your own UGSV app, Tencent Cloud VOD launched a one-stop UGSV solution that includes everything from video generation and uploading to processing, distribution and playback.

The UGSV SDK leverages the powerful video uploading, storage, transcoding and distribution capabilities of Tencent Cloud VOD, as well as the video content recognition technology of Tencent Cloud IM to offer you features such as video capturing, clipping, splicing, special effects, sharing and playback. With UGSV SDK, you can easily create UGSV apps for your businesses.

This document offers you a fast and simple way to explore Tencent Cloud UGSV services and guides you through activation, purchase and integration.
