MPS converts audio/video files to different bitrates and resolutions for smooth playback on various devices with different bandwidth options. It has the following features:

## Transcoding Audio/Video
Transcoding is an offline task that changes the codec, resolution, bitrate, etc., of an audio/video stream to suit different playback devices and network conditions. The benefits of transcoding include:
- Increased compatibility: a source video can be transcoded to formats (e.g., MP4) compatible with more devices for smooth playback.
- Increased bandwidth adaptability: a source video can be transcoded for playback at different clarity levels such as smooth, SD, HD, and FHD. End users can select the bitrate that best suits their network conditions.
- Improved playback efficiency: the moov atom can be moved from the end of an MP4 file to the beginning, so that a video can be played before it is downloaded completely.
- Reduced bandwidth consumption: the use of more advanced codec technology (e.g., H.265) makes it possible to reduce the bitrate of a video substantially while maintaining its quality, which helps reduce bandwidth consumption.


The parameters you can specify for transcoding include codec, resolution, bitrate, etc. For details, see the table below.

## Watermarking
Watermarking is an offline task that adds an image to transcoded video or screenshots at the specified location. MPS supports the following types of watermarks:
- Static watermarks: watermark in PNG format, which can be the logo of a copyright owner or TV station, and is usually used as a copyright claim
- Animated watermarks: animated watermarks in APNG format

You can add multiple watermarks of different sizes to different locations of a video or screenshot.


The parameters you can specify for watermarking include watermark type, aspect ratio, position, etc. For details, see the table below.

| Parameter                     | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type (`Type`)         | Static or animated watermark                           |
| Position (`Position`)     | Relative position of a watermark in video                                 |
| Size (`ImageSize`)    | Size of a watermark                                |
| Content (`ImageContent`) | Binary data of a watermark                                 |




## Taking screenshots

Screenshot taking is an offline task that takes screenshots of a video at specified time. MPS supports the following types of screenshots:
- Time point screenshot: taking screenshots at specified time points
- Sampled screenshot: taking screenshots at regular intervals
- Sprite screenshot: taking screenshots at regular intervals and combining them into a single big image, which is known as a [sprite](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041/33504)


The parameters you can specify for screenshot taking include screenshot format, aspect ratio, etc. For details, see the table below.

### Sampled Screenshot


| Parameter                     | Description                                                         |

| Interval measurement (`SampleType`) | Sampling intervals can be measured in two ways: <li>By percent: if intervals are measured by percent, and `Interval` is set to, for example, 5 (%), 20 screenshots will be generated for a video. </li><li>By time: if intervals are measured by time, and `Interval` is set to, for example, 10 (sec), the number of screenshots generated will depend on the video length.</li> |
| Interval (`Interval`)   | Sampling interval. <li>If interval measurement is by percent, this parameter is a percent value </li><li>If interval measurement is by time, this parameter is a time value (sec). </li> |
| Fill mode (`FillType`) | Fill mode specifies how source video images are processed when their aspect ratio does not match the specified aspect ratio of screenshots. The following fill modes are supported: <li>Scale to fill: source video images are stretched to match the aspect ratio of screenshots. This may distort source images. </li><li>Black bars: the aspect ratio of source video images is retained, and the empty spaces are painted black. </li><li>White bars: the aspect ratio of source video images is retained, and the empty spaces are painted white.</li><li>Gaussian blur: the aspect ratio of source video images is retained, and Gaussian blur is applied to the empty spaces. </li> |

## Generating Animated Images
Animated image generation is an offline task that converts a video segment to an animated image (e.g., GIF or WebP). An animated image is a seamless cycle of continuous frames, whose size is smaller than a video segment.


The parameters you can set for animated image generation include format, width, height, frame rate, etc. For details, see the table below.

| Parameter                     | Description                                                         |
