Cloud Infinite (CI) is an image processing and storage service and part of Tencent Cloud. It uses buckets, which are based on the [Cloud Object Storage (COS) service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436?from_cn_redirect=1), to store user data. You can create buckets using the CI Console and configure them in the [COS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cos5).
