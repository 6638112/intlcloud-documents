**2. our relationship with other third parties**

2.1 From time to time, we receive requests for disclosure of data which do not belong to and/or are not held by us. To clarify: We cannot assist on requests relating to any platform or service other than Tencent Cloud International Services (including any data that is held by or regarding such other platforms or services). It is the Requesting Authority's responsibility to make the appropriate request(s) to such other platforms or services (and their operators) as necessary. 

**3. general principles of this policy**

We apply this Policy in accordance with the following principles. Further details are set out in the remainder of this Policy.

3.1 **We act in accordance with Requests when legally required to do so.** The basis for the Requests that we comply with may be pursuant to specific laws and regulations. Such actions may include the removal or disabling of certain content in one or more jurisdictions.

3.2 **We do not retain all user information and content, and such information and content may be deleted, de-personalised and/or revised from time to time**. Our end users maintain the right to treat their information, and we will treat their information, in accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This means that we do not retain all such information, and they may from time to time be revised or deleted. Further information regarding our data handling practice is set out in [Terms of Service](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/301/9248) and [Privacy Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/301/17345). 

3.3 **We aim to apply this Policy consistently and fairly across all jurisdictions where we operate Tencent Cloud International Services, and in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations and our interpretation of potential differences between jurisdictions**. Tencent Cloud International Services are available outside of the People’s Republic of China, South Korea, North America, the EEA, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, and to that end we aim to apply all of our terms (including this Policy) fairly and consistently across those jurisdictions. 

3.4 **Further to Section 3.3, we may depart from this Policy from time to time for various reasons**, including for instance, due to applicable laws and regulations or pursuant to professional advice we have received on the matter. 

3.5 **We aim to be transparent with our users in the actions that we take.** Before and/or after we comply with a Request (depending on the Request and applicable laws and regulations), we reserve the right to notify our users of the Request (including the actions being sought by the Request) unless we are explicitly requested by the Requesting Authority or prohibited from doing so by applicable laws and regulations and subject to Section 7. This is to ensure that our users have a right to respond to the Request. In addition, where the Request is in relation to actions that may affect other users, we may also notify other users of the relevant Request that we have complied with, subject to applicable laws and regulations. 

3.6 **We do not automatically comply with all Requests**. We will always carefully review all Requests to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws and regulations in our response, while respecting our users' rights. That may include taking appropriate internal and third-party professional advice.  

**4. HOW WE APPLY THIS POLICY**

As above, we aim to apply this Policy fairly and consistently wherever we operate. We note the following in relation to how we apply this Policy: 

(a) **In certain circumstances, we may not be able to remove information and/or content due to a conflict of legal requirements in different jurisdictions.** In those cases, we may treat such information and/or content differently for different jurisdictions.	

(b) **We will carefully review all Requests to make sure they comply with the applicable laws and regulations.** Where relevant or necessary, we may require appropriate legal and/or supporting documentation to be provided by the Requesting Authority before we comply with the Request.  

(c) **Nothing in this Policy waives or limits any of our rights under all applicable laws and regulations – we expressly reserve all such rights and may respond to any Requests at our sole discretion.** We may, as appropriate, question any Requests – including requesting governmental/judicial review of, and third-party legal advice regarding, any Requests. 

**5. an overview of how we deal with requests**

**5.1** When we receive a Request, we will generally deal with such Request in accordance with the following (and always subject to applicable laws and regulations): 

(a) Review of the Request, to ensure that it meets all relevant legal and our requirements. 

(b) Whether it is permitted, necessary and/or appropriate to notify the affected user(s) (also see Sections 3.5 and 7). 

(c) Responding to the Requesting Authority regarding the outcome of the Request. 

**6. WHAT KINDS OF REQUESTS DO WE RESPOND TO?**

6.1 **General requirements**

To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, all Requests must:

(a) be typed and in PDF file format; 

(b) be sent on the Requesting Authority's letterhead and signed by an appropriate and authorised representative of the Requesting Authority - see Section 6.2; 

(c) include all information as set out in Section 6.3;  

(d) be sent in accordance with Section 9;

Note that we may not respond to any Requests that do not meet the above requirements. 

6.2 **Who can send Requests?**

Appropriate Requesting Authorities may be different in different jurisdictions. Depending on the jurisdiction, legitimate Requests may be submitted by several types of government agencies, such as telecommunication authorities or consumer protection authorities. 

The power of many of these authorities will differ depending on the jurisdiction in question. As above, we will review all Requests in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. 

6.3 **Form of Request**

To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we require that each Request contains the following information, and any other information as required by applicable laws and regulations, in order to process such Request:

(a) the Requesting Authority's identity;

(b) the identity of the specific officer and/or agent of the Requesting Authority responsible for the request (the "**Request Contact**"), including their rank, badge/identification number and identification documents;

(c) the relevant authorisation document(s) of the specific officer and/or agent of the Requesting Authority, if applicable;

(d) contact details for the Request Contact, including phone number, email address (which must be from the Requesting Authority’s email domain address) and postal address;

(e) a reasonable date that we should respond to the Request by; 

(f) if applicable, the IP address, Uniform Resource Locator, or user of the Tencent Cloud International Services to which the Request relates, including all known information pertaining to the relevant user - including users’ identification, account details and/or email addresses. This will help us to identify the data subject and/or other information requested;

Please note that we may be unable to respond to any vague or incomplete Requests.

**7. NOTIFICATION OF OUR USERS**

Further to Section 3.5, we respect our users’ rights and privacy. We may notify the relevant user about any Requests prior to acting on them, unless we are explicitly requested by the Requesting Authority or prohibited from doing so under applicable laws or regulations, by the terms of any legal process (such as a confidentiality order), or where we reasonably believe that such actions may create imminent danger or risk for us or any third party. This notification may allow the end user to seek appropriate protective relief. 

Requesting Authorities who believe that notification would jeopardize an ongoing legal investigation should obtain an appropriate court order or legal process that specifically prohibits notification of our users or otherwise substantiate its Request on the basis of the applicable laws and regulations. It is the Requesting Authority's responsibility to Request and substantiate in conformance with by applicable laws and regulations that we do not notify a user of the Request.  

If your Request is in relation to an ongoing or prior violation of our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we will take action to prevent further abuse, including actions that may notify the user that we are aware of their misconduct, all subject to and in conformance with by applicable laws and regulations. If you believe in good faith that such actions will jeopardize an ongoing investigation, it is your responsibility to request that we defer such action, whenever possible pursuant to applicable laws and regulations including providing to us the appropriate court order or legal process prohibiting such notification. 

We reserve the right to challenge any non-disclosure requests or orders, pursuant to applicable laws and regulations. 

**8. REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS**

To the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations, we may seek reimbursement of our costs in responding to a Request.

**9. WHERE SHOULD REQUESTS BE SENT TO?
