<ol style = 'list-style-type :lower-latin'>
<li> 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' will have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;</li>

<li>'the sub-processor' refers to any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other sub-processor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub-processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;</li>

### Details of the transfer

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.

### Third-party beneficiary clause

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clauses  4(b) to 4(i), Clauses 5(a) to 5(e) and 5(g) to 5(j), Clauses 6.1 and 6.2, Clause 7, Clause 8.2 and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.

### Liability

1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or sub-processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with Clause 6.1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.  The data importer may not rely on a breach by a sub-processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.
3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in Clauses 6.1 and 6.2, arising out of a breach by the sub-processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub-processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub-processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the sub-processor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

### Mediation and jurisdiction

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject: 
<ol style = 'list-style-type :lower-latin'>
<li>to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;</li>
<li>to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.</li></ol>
2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

### Cooperation with supervisory authorities

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3. The data importer will promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub-processor, pursuant to Clause 8.2. In such a case the data exporter will be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).

### Governing Law

The Clauses will be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

### Variation of the contract

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clauses.

### Sub-processing

1. The data importer will not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it will do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer will remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub-processor will also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in Clause 6.1 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the sub-processor will be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in Clause 11.1 will be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
4. The data exporter will keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which will be updated at least once a year. The list will be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.

### Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the sub-processor will, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or will destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2. The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in Clause 12.1.
