Pricing tiers are available for most Tencent Cloud products.
They give you lower prices the more you use a service. The higher the usage, the lower the unit price; the longer the usage duration, the larger the discount.

Tencent Cloud pricing has two models: tiered pricing and volume pricing.

### Tiered Pricing
Each tier of a product has a different price. You can get the total price by multiplying the usage and unit price in each tier and adding up the prices of all tiers.
For example, if product A adopts tiered pricing and is billed hourly and settled monthly, then its prices are as follows:

| Tier (Usage Duration in Hours) | Unit Price (in USD) |
| --------------- | -------- |
| 0 < usage duration ≤ 10      | 5.00     |
| 10 < usage duration ≤ 15     | 3.00     |
| 15 < usage duration ≤ 20     | 1.00     |

If you use the product for 16 hours in this month, you need to pay 10 * 5 + (15 - 10) * 3 + 1 * 1 = 66 USD.


### Volume Pricing
Each tier of a product has a different price. You can get the total price by multiplying the total usage and the unit price in the tier into which the total usage falls into.
For example, if product B adopts volume pricing and is billed hourly and settled monthly, then its prices are as follows:

| Tier (Usage Duration in Hours) | Unit Price (in USD) |
| --------------- | -------- |
| 0 < usage duration ≤ 10      | 5.00     |
| 10 < usage duration ≤ 15     | 3.00     |
| 15 < usage duration ≤ 20     | 1.00     |

If you use the product for 16 hours in this month, you need to pay 16 * 1 = 16 USD.


### Higher Cost-Effectiveness for Larger Business Scale
For pay-as-you-go products, the more the usage, the lower the unit price. Taking CVM as an example, its unit price in tier 2 is only 50% of that in tier 1.
For monthly subscription products, the longer the purchase period, the larger the discount. Taking a monthly subscription TencentDB product as an example, you can get 12%, 17%, 60%, and 70% off if you purchase it for 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years respectively.
