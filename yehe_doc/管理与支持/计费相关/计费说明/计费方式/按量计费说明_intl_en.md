Tencent Cloud's post-paid billing account provides you with a better experience by extending a credit limit, allowing you to spend within the credit limit for any Tencent Cloud services. We will automatically charge the bill amount using your default payment method bound with your post-paid account based on your billing cycle. You can also make an early payment. Once the bill is paid successfully, your available credit will be restored.

## Post-paid account information
### Initial Credit
Initial credit is the credit offered by Tencent Cloud according to a customer's credit rating, which will increase with successful payments.

### Available Credit
Available credit is the current available amount of credit within the billing cycle, and you can purchase any Tencent Cloud services if you have a surplus amount of available credit in your post-paid billing account. Available credit is a variable, which can run out if there is a large bill pending.

Available Credit = Credit limit - unsettled amount - outstanding balance - deposit

### Credit Limit
Credit limit is the maximum current credit, which equals to  Initial Credit plus top-up amount (payment overflow).

### Unsettled Amount
Unsettled amount is the total fees for using Tencent Cloud services during the current bill period.

### Outstanding Balance
Outstanding balance is the total fees payable by you to Tencent Cloud, which includes the due amount and overdue amount.

### Due Amount
Due amount refers to the bill amount that should be paid before the due date.

### Overdue Amount
Overdue amount refers to the bill amount that should have been paid before the due date and is in fact overdue.

### Deposit
For certain pay-as-you-go services such as CVM, the system estimates an amount based on the billing cycle and usage in previous periods and reserves the estimated amount in the available credit. Deposit is the amount reserved in the post-paid account by the system, and it cannot be spent until the resource is released. For deposit rules of each product, please refer to the description of each product.

### Billing Cycle
A billing cycle is the time interval at which your spending on Tencent Cloud products is added up and billed. If you are not served by one of our sales representatives, your billing cycle is 0 by default. If you are, your billing cycle is a month by default, and fees will be deducted automatically on the 10th day of each month using the payment method bound to your post-paid account. Your sales representative can adjust your billing cycle.

For example, if your initial credit is 1,000 USD, and your billing cycle is a month, we will calculate your fees for April in May and charge you on June 10.

### Monthly Expense Alert

Send a reminder when the monthly expense (excluding the amount deducted by vouchers) exceeds the alert threshold. You can set up reminders and message recipients in Message Subscription. By default, reminders will be sent via Message Center, email, and SMS.
