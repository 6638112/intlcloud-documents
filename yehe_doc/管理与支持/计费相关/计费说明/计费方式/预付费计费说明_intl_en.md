>! The monthly subscription mode is being tested. If you want to try it, please contact sales.

Prepaid plans generally take the form of **monthly subscriptions**. Based on your needs, you can pay upfront for Tencent Cloud resources for a month, several months, or several years. After payment, you will be able to access the purchased resources until your subscription expires.

    You can renew your subscription in [Renewal Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/7454) to extend the validity period of your resources.
