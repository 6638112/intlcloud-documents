### Setting balance alerts
1. Log in to the console, go to **Billing Center > Payment Management > [Payment](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/expense/recharge)**, and click **Balance alert**.

### Disabling balance alerts
If you do not want to receive balance alerts anymore, unselect **Receive balance alerts**.

### How balance alerts work
- Alerts are triggered when your account balance is below the threshold.
- We will send you only one alert daily (00:00-24:00) and will stop after the first five days.
