### What is auto-renewal?
You can enable auto-renewal for a resource if you intend to use it in the long term. You can manage resources set to auto-renewal under the **Auto-renewal** tab on the renewal management page.
- Resources set to auto-renewal are renewed automatically on the expiration date, but the exact renewal time may be later than the expiration time. Please do not change the auto-renewal setting for resources that are about to expire or be repossessed.
- If your account has insufficient balance to cover the cost of renewal on the expiration date, we will check your account balance daily during the following 6 days, and once there is sufficient balance, we will renew the resources set to auto-renewal.
- During the 7 days before expiration, if your account has sufficient balance for renewal, we will not send you reminders and will renew your resources on the expiration day; if not, we will remind you to top up. During the 6 days after expiration, we will remind you to top up until your account has sufficient balance for renewal.
- If you cancel auto-renewal for your resources, we will resume the notify-before-expiration practice for them.
