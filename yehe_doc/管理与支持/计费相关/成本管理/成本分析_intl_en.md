## Cost Analysis

Cost analysis is a basic feature of cost management. It helps you analyze your bill data flexibly and efficiently, and gives you a clearer understanding of your cloud costs.

To use cost analysis, log in to the [Billing Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/overview), and click **Cost Management > Cost Explorer** in the left sidebar to enter the cost analysis page.

## Cost Analysis Features

### Categories

You can select different categories to aggregate and display your costs based on different dimensions.

One category can be selected at a time. The chart displays the categorized cost data over a certain period of time.

Categories include product, billing mode, subproduct, project name, region, availability zone, transaction type, and tag.

>? The chart displays only the first 10 items for the selected category. Any remaining items are summarized as "others". You can view and download the full data in the Cost Details table displayed under the chart.

### Spend types and bill types

You can choose different combinations of spend types and bill types for more detailed cost analysis.

Spend types include original price, total amount (price after discounts are applied), cash, voucher, free credit, and commission.

Bill types include bills and consumption bills. To view consumption bills, you need to enable them in the console first. For details, see [Consumption Bill Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/555/44227).

**Total Amount** and **Bills** are selected by default, which is suitable for conventional cost analysis. For amortization, you can select **consumption bills**. To view only cash flow expenditures, you can select **Cash**. You can select other spend types for other types of analysis.

### Time period
- Cost data can be displayed for a specified time period or a relative time period at daily or monthly granularities.

- **Specified period**: Select the start date and the end date in the calendar.

- **Relative period**: Select a time period from the top of the calendar. This is mainly used to automatically update a regularly occurring cost report. Daily granularity supports the last 7, 30, and 60 days. Monthly granularity supports the last 1, 3, and 6 months.
