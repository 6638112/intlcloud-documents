> - Daily spend includes your actual spend on monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go resources. Assume that you pay 120 USD for a 12-month subscription of a CVM. The 120 USD will be entirely counted into the spend of the day of purchase.
> - The spend data on this page and in the notifications we send to you is estimation and may differ from your actual spend. It only covers your spend until the date you view the page.
> - The chart displays the top 10 projects by spend, and the rest are aggregated into "Others". You can export the data to view the spend of all projects.

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/dce901907cdf56642a79481ff9427626.png)
Two alert types are supported: daily data alert and monthly data alert.
 - Daily data alert has three modes: day-over-day, month-over-month, and fixed value (compare your daily spend against a fixed value).
 Daily data alert formulas:
    - MoM = ABS ((Daily spend this month − Spend on the same day last month) / Spend on the same day last month × 100%)
    - DoD = ABS ((Daily spend on a day − Spend on the previous day) / Spend on the previous day × 100%)
    - Fixed value = Compare spend on a day against a fixed value
 - Monthly data alert has two modes: month-over-month and fixed value (compare your monthly spend against a fixed value).
 Monthly data alert formulas:
    - MoM = ABS ((Spend this month - Spend last month) / Spend last month × 100%)
For example, on August 18, spend in the current month is your total spend between August 1 and August 16, which is compared against your spend between July 1 and July 16.
    - Fixed value = Compare spend in the current month against a fixed value
   - You can configure alert notifications by product and billing mode.
   Product: All purchased products of the current user are displayed. The logic of the billing mode is similar.
3. Click **Save**.

You can click **Edit** to modify the alert settings as needed.
