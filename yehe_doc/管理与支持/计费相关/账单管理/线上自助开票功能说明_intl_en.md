# Online Invoicing

Tencent Cloud has launched a convenient and efficient self-service invoicing feature.


## Application

The invoice receiving feature is not enabled by default. After finishing identity verification, you can choose whether to check “Receive PDF invoice via email”. If it is checked, the system will verify whether the previous months’ bill amounts have been confirmed on the 6th days of the following months. If so, the system will send a PDF invoice to your mailbox within 3-5 business days.

To enable this feature, log in to the Tencent Cloud console and go to **Billing Center** > **Bills** > **Invoicing**.
