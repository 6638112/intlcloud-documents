## About Bill Subscription
If you subscribe to bills, after your bill is generated each month, Tencent Cloud will send bill notifications to the recipients you specify. The notifications offer an overview of your costs in the previous month and can be used for reconciliation.

- Time of notification: An overview of your monthly costs is sent between the second and fourth day of the next month.
- Content of notification: Below are samples of the notifications you will receive in Message Center and via email:
