You can purchase Tencent Cloud services only if your account has a sufficient balance. Most Tencent Cloud services are billed hourly. To prevent service suspension due to overdue payments, use "online payment" or "bank transfer" to pay the overdue charges in a timely manner.

To ensure data security, only creators and collaborators authorized with financial permissions can enter the "Payment" page.

### Online Payments
Go to **Billing Center**, click **Payment Management** > **Payment**, and pay with your credit card.

If you topped up your account with the exact same amount within the last minute, a pop-up window will remind you to check your top-up records to avoid making duplicate payments.
