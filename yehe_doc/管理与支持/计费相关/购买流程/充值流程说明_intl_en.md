You can purchase Tencent Cloud services only if your account has sufficient balance. Most Tencent Cloud services are billed hourly. To prevent service suspension due to overdue payment, use "online payment" or "bank transfer" to pay the past due charges in a timely manner.

To ensure data security, only creators and collaborators authorized with financial permissions can enter the "Payment" page.

### Online payment
Go to **Billing Center**, click **Payment Management -> Payment**, and top-up with your credit card.
