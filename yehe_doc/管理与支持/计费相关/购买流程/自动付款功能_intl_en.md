Tencent Cloud International provides certain credit limit within certain billing cycle for pay-as-you-go accounts. You can use such credit to purchase products and make payments later. The credit limits and auto-payment frequencies are subject to customer types.
### I. Customers without sales reps
Credit limits for customers without sales reps are dynamically adjusted according to the successful auto-payment records.
1. After you sign up and associate your credit card successfully, the system will grant you a credit limit of 1 USD.
2. After the first successful auto-payment, the system will increase the credit limit to 30 USD.
3. The system will increase the credit limit by 20 USD for each subsequent successful auto-payment.
4. The credit limit can be increased to up to 150 USD.
Notes on auto-payment frequencies:
On the payment due date, the system will deduct the payable amount using your default payment method (credit card). The payment due dates are subject to the billing cycles (hourly, daily, or monthly) of your purchased pay-as-you-go products. Assume that your pay-as-you-go products use hourly billing cycle. The system will check whether the remaining credit is sufficient for payments every hour. If not, auto-payment will be triggered.

### II. Customers with sales reps
By default, auto-payment is disabled for customers with sales reps. You can go to **[Billing Center > Account Info](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/expense)** to enable this feature.
After you enable this feature:
1. On the monthly payment due date (the 10th of every month), the system will deduct payments for all confirmed, due, and unpaid bills for the past months using your default payment method.
2. The payment due dates are subject to the months of the bills and the billing cycles of your account.
For example, if your billing cycle is one month, then your bill for May will be generated early June and the due date for payment will be July 10; if your billing cycle is two months, then your bill for May will be generated early June and the due date for payment will be August 10.
3. If bills for the past months have not been confirmed, the system will not automatically deduct payments, even when it’s the due date. The system will detect such bills and initiate auto-payments for them in the next cycle. If you hope auto-payments are made as scheduled, please confirm your bills after they are generated each month.

### III. FAQs
1. Why did auto-payments stop?
The frequency of auto-payments will change before and after you have a sales rep. Auto-payments of customers without sales reps are made according to their pay-as-you-go product billing cycles, and the shortest is hourly cycle. For customers with sales reps, the sales reps will apply for payment cycles for them, and the shortest is monthly cycle. If your current credit limit is not sufficient for one month's consumption, you’re advised to contact your sales rep to increase the credit limit or top up your account in time.
