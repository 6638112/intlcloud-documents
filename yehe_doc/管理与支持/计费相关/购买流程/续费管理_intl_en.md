## Single-Resource Renewal
You can renew a monthly subscription resource via two methods:
- [Log in](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and renew the resource in the corresponding console.
- Go to **Billing Center** > **[Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal)** to renew the resource.

You can filter your resources by expiration time, product type, region, etc.


## Batch Renewal
Go to **Billing Center** > **[Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal)**, select the resources you want to renew, and click **Batch Renewal**.

- You can select all resources across pages.
- If you want to use vouchers, make sure the number of resources you select for renewal does not exceed 100. You cannot use vouchers if you select over 100 resources.


## Auto-renewal
If you intend to use a resource in the long term, you can set it to **auto-renewal**. You can manage resources set to auto-renewal under the **Auto-renewal** tab.

- Resources set to auto-renewal are renewed automatically on the expiration date, but the exact renewal time may be later than the expiration time. **Please do not change the auto-renewal setting for resources that are about to expire or be repossessed.**
- If your account has insufficient balance to cover the cost of renewal on the expiration date, before service suspension, we will check your account balance on a daily basis, and once there is sufficient balance, we will renew the resources set to auto-renewal. For more information on service suspension, see [Prepaid Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/42701).
- Applicable vouchers will be used automatically during auto-renewal.
- Suspended resources will not be renewed automatically or appear on the renewal management page. To restore a suspended resource, see [Restoring Suspended Resource](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/43892).
- If you cancel auto-renewal for your resources, we will resume the notify-before-expiration practice for them.


## No Renewal upon Expiration
If you intend to stop using a resource after it expires, you can set it to **non-renewal**. You can manage resources set to non-renewal under the **Non-renewal** tab.

- We will not send notifications prior to the expiration of resources set to non-renewal.
- If you switch your resources from non-renewal to manual renewal or auto-renewal, we will implement the notify-before-expiration practice for them.


## Same-Date Renewal

>! When you renew multiple resources to the same date of a month, the renewal period for each resource cannot be shorter than 1 month. We will calculate the total renewal fee by multiplying the number of days renewed by the daily cost of the resources.
>

- You can follow the steps below to renew some or all of your resources to the same date of a month, after which the system will send you reminders prior to their unified expiration date.
 1. Go to **Billing Center** > [Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal), select the resources you want to renew to the same date, and click **Renew to Same Date**.
 2. In the pop-up window, select a date (the 1st to 27th day of a month), and click **Confirm**.

- If you want to change the unified expiration date for resources that have already been renewed to the same date, follow the steps below:
 1. Go to **Billing Center** > **[Renewal Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/renewal)**, select the resources for which you want to change the unified expiration date, and click **Renew to Same Date**.
 2. In the pop-up window, click **Modify**.
 3. Select a new date (the 1st to 27th day of a month) and click **Confirm**.
For example, assume that a resource originally expires on December 4. The resource is priced at 159.5 USD per month, which equals a daily cost of 5.32 USD. If you want to change its expiration date to the 1st day of a month, you need to renew it to February 1, and the renewal fee would be 313.68 USD (159.5 + (59 - 30) × 5.32).


## Renewal Reminder
You can customize when to receive renewal reminders. This may be helpful if your budget application process is time-consuming.
- Depending on your configuration, the system can send you reminders 7 days to 3 months before the date of expiration or auto-renewal.
- The system can send you reminders via Message Center, SMS, and email if an auto-renewal resource of yours is about to expire and there is insufficient balance in your account to cover the renewal fee. You can customize the channels to receive the reminders.
- If you don’t select any channel, we will not send you reminders.
- These settings take effect only for the logged in account, not for other collaborators.
- You can change the mobile number or email address for your account on the [User List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam) page.
