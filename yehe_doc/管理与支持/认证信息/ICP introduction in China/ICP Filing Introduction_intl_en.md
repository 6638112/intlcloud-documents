#### Add a copyright notice to the website (optional)

After you add the ICP filing number to your website, some provincial communications administration bureaus (such as Jiangsu) also suggest adding a copyright notice at the bottom of the website. The copyright owner name must be the same as the filing entity.

#### Public Security Bureau (PSB) filing

Within 30 days after obtaining an ICP filing for your website from MIIT, you must log in to [the National Internet Security Management Service Platform](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index.do) to submit the PSB filing application.

Within 30 days after passing the PSB filing review, you must log in to [the National Internet Security Management Service Platform](http://www.beian.gov.cn/portal/index.do), copy your **website's PSB filing number** in the details of your filed website, download the **filing number icon**, and add the icon with your PSB filing number to the bottom of your web page.
