**Introduction to FISC and the FISC Guidelines for the Security of Computer Systems in Financial Institutions**

FISC (The Center for Financial Industry Information Systems) was established in November 1984 as an incorporated foundation. In April 2011, FISC was approved by the Prime Minister to change its classification to become a public interest incorporated foundation.

To improve the security of financial institutions, FISC has developed a series of security guidelines in cooperation with its member institutions, the Financial Services Agency and the Bank of Japan. Among them, the "FISC Security Guidelines on Computer Systems for Financial Institutions" formulated by FISC in 1985 provided effective guidance for Japanese banks and financial institutions to build their secure information systems and ensure the operation of information systems. Also, it has been widely recognized and widely used by Japanese banks and financial institutions. Currently, the latest version of the "FISC Security Guidelines on Computer Systems for Financial Institutions" is the 9th edition revised in 2020.
