The project management feature enables you to better manage Tencent Cloud services and products by assigning different products to different projects. You can create and disable projects, and view device usage and billing details of each project. This feature not only improves your productivity, but also helps you monitor the use of products, so that different products under different project do not interfere with one another. **You can create up to 500 projects under one account.** This document describes how to use this feature in detail.
