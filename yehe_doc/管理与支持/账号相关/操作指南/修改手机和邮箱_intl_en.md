## Introduction
This document describes how to modify your registered mobile number and email address.

## Prerequisites
Before modifying the information, you need to understand the following concepts:
- **Contact mobile number**: it is the mobile number used to receive subscribed messages (such as payment overdue notifications, product expiration notifications, and event notifications) for non-verification purposes.
- **Contact email address**: it is the email address used to receive subscribed messages (such as payment overdue notifications, product expiration notifications, and event notifications) for non-verification purposes.
- **Recovery mobile number**: it is the mobile number used to verify your identity as a means of account protection.
- **Recovery email address**: it is an auxiliary means of account holder identity verification.
- **Login email address**: if you sign up for a Tencent Cloud account without using your email address, you can bind the account to an email address for future login.

>! To protect your account security and avoid potential losses caused by missed messages, please use the same mobile number/email address for both recovery and contact purposes.
