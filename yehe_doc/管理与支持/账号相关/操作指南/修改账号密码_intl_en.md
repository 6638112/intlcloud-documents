## Introduction
This document describes how to change your login password after logging in to Tencent Cloud.
>1. This is the password used to **log in to your Tencent Cloud account together with your email address**. If you did not sign up with an email address and have yet to bind your Tencent Cloud account to an email address, you will not be able to change the account password.


The account password is the most important credential used to protect your account security. Please keep it private and change it regularly.

- We recommend changing the password at least once every 90 days.
- The new password must be different from the last three passwords.
- The password must contain 8â€“20 letters, digits, and symbols (such as ".", "/", and "_", but not spaces).


## Prerequisites
1. You have logged in to Tencent Cloud.
2. You signed up for your Tencent Cloud account with an email address or have bound your account to an email address.
