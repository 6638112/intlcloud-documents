## Overview
This document shows you how to modify the email address bound to your account.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, please make sure you understand the following concepts:
- **Contact email**: The email address that receives messages from Tencent Cloud, including notifications about overdue payments, resource expiration, and events.
- **Verification email**: The email address used for identity verification.
- **Login email**: If you didnâ€™t use an email address to sign up for Tencent Cloud, you can add a login email, which you can use to log in to Tencent Cloud.

>! To protect your account and avoid potential losses caused by missed messages, we recommend you keep your verification email/mobile number consistent with your contact email/mobile number.

## Directions
### Modifying your contact email
1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud console, go to the [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer) page, and click the edit icon next to your contact email address.
