Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple and effective security authentication method. It adds an additional layer of protection to strengthen the username and password credentials. An MFA device, also called a dynamic password card or token, is a device that enables this authentication method. Tencent Cloud currently offers one type of MFA device: virtual MFA device.


## Virtual MFA Device
A virtual MFA device is an application program that generates dynamic authentication codes. It is compliant with the time-based one-time password (TOTP) standard as defined in RFC 6238. Tencent Cloud's virtual MFA devices are supported by the Tencent Cloud Assistant mini program.
