If your account is logged in on multiple devices, or you suspect that your account has been compromised, you can log out of your account from all devices including the current one. You are recommended to change the login method on the [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer) page first.
1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console, enter the [Security Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/security) page, go to **Login Status Management** and click **Log out from All Devices**.
2. Click **Log out Now** as prompted.
