Operation protection is an additional layer of protection that Tencent Cloud provides for sensitive operations. After operation protection is enabled, you will need to complete identity verification before performing sensitive operations.

A verification code is often used for secondary confirmation when you perform sensitive operations in the console.

## Operation Protection Types
| Operation Protection Type | Description                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Do not enable | Secondary verification will not be performed.                            |
| Enable MFA | To perform an operation in the console, you must enter the correct MFA password on the identity verification page; otherwise, the operation cannot be performed. |
| Enable email verification | To perform an operation in the console, you must enter the verification code received in your inbox on the verification page; otherwise, the operation cannot be performed. |
| Enable SMS verification | To perform an operation in the console, you must enter the verification code received on your phone on the verification page; otherwise, the operation cannot be performed. |
