Login protection is an additional layer of protection that Tencent Cloud provides for logins. An additional identity verification credential is required after the correct username and password are entered.

After login protection is enabled, you must verify your identity every time you log in to the Tencent Cloud website. This prevents others from logging in to your account even if they have cracked your password.

## Enabling Login Protection
1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console and go to [Security Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer/security) page. Click the edit icon next to **Login Protection** to enable it.
