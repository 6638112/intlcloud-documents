- This document describes how to change the identity information of a Tencent Cloud account whose individual/organization identity has already been verified. The identity verification information determines an account's ownership. After the identity of an account is verified, we recommend you not change the identity information arbitrarily.
  >!
  - There is no time limit on changing an individual identity to an organization identity. Other types of identity information change need to be made 30 days after last successful identity verification.
  - Between the application of identity information change and the approval/rejection of the application after review, you can submit a [ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder) to withdraw the application at any time, and the originally verified entity will stay unchanged.
  - Between the application of identity information change and the approval/rejection of the application after review, resources and incurred fees should be subject to the originally verified entity.

  1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console, enter the [Account Information](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer) page, select **Basic Information** > **Verification Status**, and click **View/Change Verification**.
