## Operation Scenarios
This document describes how to verify the organization identity for your Tencent Cloud account. After successful verification, the account and Tencent Cloud resources under it will belong to you and can be used in organizational businesses on the Tencent Cloud official website. You can apply for special VAT invoices for them but cannot use them in individual businesses.
>One set of organization identity information (organization name/business number) can be used to verify the identity of up to three Tencent Cloud accounts.

>If you want to apply for ICP filing in the future, please make sure that the name in identity verification is the same as that of the ICP filing entity; otherwise, ICP filing application will fail.
