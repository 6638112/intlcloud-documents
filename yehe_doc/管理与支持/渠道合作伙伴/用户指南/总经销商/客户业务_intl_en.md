A distributor can conduct the first-level and second-level resale business at the same time.
1. Customer business (first-level resale): As a distributor, you can directly conduct business with customers in the distributor-to-customer flow. For more information, see [Reseller's Customer Business](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1085/43042).
2. Reseller business (second-level resale): As a distributor, you can also conduct business with resellers in the distributor-to-reseller-to-customer flow.
