>1. The credit is granted by you to your resellers only for the purpose of allocating credit among customers.
>2. Credit control is only a tool provided by Tencent Cloud for partners to control the approximate amount of credit available to customers. Due to the different billing modes and settlement cycles of Tencent Cloud services, there may be delays and differences in the monitoring of the fees incurred by customers.
>3. When the credits of your resellers are insufficient, they will contact you offline to adjust their credits.
>4. In the reseller mode, all fees incurred by resellers’ customers are paid by the partner, so caution should be exercised.
>5. A credit will immediately take effect once set.

### 2. Repossessing Credit
You can enter a negative value for the **Allocated amount** field to repossess a reseller’s available credit as needed. **The credit you can repossess** must be not greater than **the reseller’s available credit**.
