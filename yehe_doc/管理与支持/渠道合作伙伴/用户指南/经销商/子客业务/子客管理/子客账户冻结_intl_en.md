### Freezing Customer Account
If you find that your customer’s account is abnormal or has overdue payments, you can freeze the accounts of all your customers.
Step 1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://www.tencentcloud.com/login) with your partner account and enter the [Partner Center](https://console.tencentcloud.com/partners).
Step 2. Select **Customer Management** on the left sidebar, click the **My Customers** tab, and click **Freeze Account** in the **Operation** column to freeze the customer account.

Step 3. After the customer’s account is frozen, their account status will become **Frozen** and their pay-as-you-go services will be suspended.

### Impact of Customer Account Being Frozen
After a customer’s account is frozen, they cannot purchase or renew services.
The purchased prepaid services can still be normally used, but the activated pay-as-you-go services will be instantly suspended according to the customer service suspension rules.
