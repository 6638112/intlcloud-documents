### Allocating Credit to Reseller's Customer

You can query all your customers under your account and view their basic information and available credit.

Step 1. Step 1. Contact your sales rep to apply for customer credits. (Note: The credits here are different from the resellerâ€™s self-use credits. Please inform your sales rep that the credits you apply for will be allocated to customers.)

Step 2. Use your partner account to log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login) and enter the [Partner Center](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/partners).

Step 3. Select **Customer Management** on the left sidebar, click the **My Customers** tab, and allocate credits to your customers in the customer list.

>1. The credit is the credit limit available to a customer. It is calculated as published at the Tencent Cloud official website and excludes deductions from vouchers.
>2. Credit control is only a tool provided by Tencent Cloud for partners to control the approximate amount of credit available to reseller's customers. Due to the billing modes and settlement periods of Tencent Cloud services, there may be delays and differences in the monitoring of the fees incurred by customers.
>3. We will send alarm notifications to you when a customer has used more than 75%, 90%, and 100% of their credit.
>4. In reseller mode, all fees incurred by reseller's customers are payable by the partner, so caution should be exercised.
>5. A credit will take effect immediately once set.

<b> 2. Withdraw credit</b>

You can enter a negative value to withdraw the available credit of a customer. The maximum **withdrawable customer credit** must be less than or equal to the **available customer credit**.
