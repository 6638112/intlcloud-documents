> - The credit is the credit limit available to a customer. It is calculated as published at the Tencent Cloud official website and excludes deductions from vouchers.
> - Credit control is only a tool provided by Tencent Cloud for partners to control the approximate amount of credit available to reseller's customers. Due to the billing modes and settlement periods of Tencent Cloud services, there may be delays and differences in the monitoring of the fees incurred by customers.
> - We will send alarm notifications to you when a customer has used more than 75%, 90%, and 100% of their credit.
> - In reseller mode, all fees incurred by reseller's customers are payable by the partner, so caution should be exercised.
> - A credit will take effect immediately once set.
> - The service for a reseller's customer with no billing permissions will be suspended when its available credit is set to 0, so caution should be exercised.
