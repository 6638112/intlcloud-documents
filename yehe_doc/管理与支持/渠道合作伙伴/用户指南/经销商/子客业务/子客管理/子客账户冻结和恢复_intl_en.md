If you find that your customer’s account is abnormal or has overdue payments, you can freeze the accounts of all your customers.
Step 1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login) with your distributor account and enter the [Partner Center](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/partners).
Step 2. Select **Customer Management** on the left sidebar, click the **My Customers** tab, and click **Freeze Account** in the **Operation** column to freeze the customer account.
If the account you want to freeze has overdue payments, only the account will be frozen, and the account’s services will remain suspended according to related rules.
If the account you want to freeze has no overdue payments, the account and its services will be frozen. The services will be suspended according to the customer service suspension rules.

### Freezing Customer Account
After a customer’s account is frozen, the customer cannot normally purchase, renew, or upgrade resources, or change the billing mode.
The purchased prepaid services can still be used if they haven’t expired . The activated pay-as-you-go services will be instantly suspended.
For service suspension rules, see [Customer Service Suspension Rules](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1085/50550).


### Unfreezing Customer Account
If you want to unfreeze an account with overdue payments, top it up first.
The customer’s services will be resumed when its account is unfrozen and has no overdue payments.
