### Issuing Voucher
>?
>- The quota for voucher issuance is initially set to 0. As a reseller, you can issue vouchers only if you have a positive voucher quota. The voucher quota here is different from your self-use voucher quota. You need to inform your channel manager that the quota is used to allocate vouchers to customers.
>- Currently, Tencent Cloud exclusively provides vouchers at its own expense. It will review and approve the issuance of such vouchers before they are issued to customers.
>- The total amount of issued vouchers (excluding rejected ones) cannot exceed the total voucher quota. You should use vouchers reasonably and issue them to customers only when necessary.

Step 1. Currently, Tencent Cloud exclusively provides vouchers at its own expense. To activate or apply for vouchers, contact your channel manager. After a voucher issuance quota is approved, you can issue vouchers to your customers.
