## Account management

### Account overview
A reseller account is a credit account. The credit is managed and adjusted by the channel manager and can be used by the reseller to pay for Tencent Cloud services used by their customers. If the reseller uses Tencent Cloud services, the credit will also be occupied.

### Account top-up
You can top up your account by credit card or bank transfer.

**Directions**

(1) Log in to the Tencent Cloud console with a reseller account.

(2) Click **Billing Center** > **Payment Management** > **Payment** > **[Bank Transfer](https://console.tencentcloud.com/expense/recharge)**.
