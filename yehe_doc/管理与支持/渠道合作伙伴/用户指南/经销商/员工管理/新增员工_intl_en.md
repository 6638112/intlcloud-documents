## Creating Employee
You can create an employee and associate them with a role. Once associated, the employee will have the role’s permissions.
After you create an employee, you need to inform them of the account name and password offline.

### Directions
1. [Log in to Partner Center](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1085/42845).
2. On the left sidebar, select **Company Information > Employee Management**.
3. Click **Create Employee**.
>!If the employee already has a sub-account, you need to complete the employee information and associate them with a role so that they can use the sub-account (the employee account name and the sub-account name must be the same). To avoid permission conflict, disassociate the permissions that were granted to the sub-account before.
