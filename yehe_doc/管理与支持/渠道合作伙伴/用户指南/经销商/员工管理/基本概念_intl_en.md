## Concepts

This document describes how to manage your employee information, create employees, and create roles.

As a reseller, you can create employee accounts with different permissions for hierarchical permission management.

>?To implement hierarchical permission management, you must create employees and assign roles by entering **Partner Center Console > Company Information > Employee Management** page. Do not directly create or delete users in the **CAM** console; otherwise, there will be a permission management conflict.

### Relationship among employee, role, and permission
A role is a collection of permissions and can be customized. An employee can have up to three roles, each with particular permissions.

Example:
If **Employee A** is assigned a role called **Customer manager (Role B)**, it will automatically have all the permissions of the Role B.
