## Frozen Account
### 1. Account in the frozen status
After your account is frozen by your reseller, you will see a note informing you of this on the **Account Info** page in the console.

### 2. Impact of the account being frozen
If your account is frozen, you cannot purchase or renew services, but you can continue to use the purchased prepaid resources. The activated pay-as-you-go services will be instantly suspended according to [Customer Service Suspension Rules](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1085/50550). To resume these services, contact your reseller to unfreeze your account as soon as possible to avoid the impact of service suspension on your business.
