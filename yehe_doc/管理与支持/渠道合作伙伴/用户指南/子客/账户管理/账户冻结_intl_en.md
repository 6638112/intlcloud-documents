### 1. Account in the Frozen Status
After your account is frozen by your reseller, you will see a note informing you of this on the **Account Information** page in the console.

### 2. Impact of the Account Being Frozen
If your account is frozen, you cannot purchase, renew, or upgrade services, or change the billing mode, but you can continue to use the purchased prepaid resources if they havenâ€™t expired. The expired prepaid services and the activated pay-as-you-go services will be instantly suspended according to [Customer Service Suspension Rules](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1085/50550). To resume these services, contact your reseller to unfreeze your account as soon as possible to avoid the impact of service suspension on your business.
