## Impact on Purchase

The account assets of a customer are divided into two parts: credit and voucher. Their impacts on product purchases are as follows:

### 1. Monthly subscribed product purchase

**Products can’t be purchased** in the following situations:

(1) The customer's available credit is below 0. At this point, the customer's service is suspended, and new purchases can’t be made.

Solution: The customer should contact their reseller to increase the credit and resume the service.

(2) The customer's available credit plus available vouchers are below the order amount. At this point, the customer's account balance is insufficient, and new purchases can’t be made.

Solution: The customer should contact their reseller to increase the credit or vouchers.

If the reseller's available credit is insufficient to pay the customer's order, new purchases can’t be made.

### 2. Pay-as-you-go product purchase

**Products can’t be purchased** in the following situations:

(1) The customer's available credit is below 0. At this point, the customer's service is suspended, and new purchases can’t be made.

Solution: The customer should contact their reseller to increase the credit and resume the service.

(2) The customer's available credit plus available vouchers are below the amount frozen by the reseller. At this point, the customer's account balance is insufficient, and new purchases can’t be made.

Solution: The customer should contact their reseller to increase the credit or vouchers.

When the customer activates a pay-as-you-go product, an amount will be frozen in the reseller's credit.
