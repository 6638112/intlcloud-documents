## Customer Service Suspension Rules
- The service suspension rules for your customers are different from the general Tencent Cloud service suspension rules.
- You can use the customer service suspension rules described in this document only if you have been added to the allowlist of the rules; otherwise, the general Tencent Cloud service suspension rules will apply.
- For Tencent Cloud service suspension rules, see the billing documentation of each service.

## Rule Descriptions
|**Resource Type**|**Rule**|
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Monthly subscribed service | Same as the rules of service suspension caused by overdue payments described in the billing documentation of the Tencent Cloud service, with a service suspension grace period and data protection period. |
| Reserved instance | Same as the rules of service suspension caused by overdue payments described in the billing documentation of the Tencent Cloud service, with a service suspension grace period and data protection period. |
| Pay-as-you-go service | The service will be immediately suspended upon overdue payments. The resources cannot be normally used and the service will enter the data protection period. You need to take actions for such service suspension. |

>- Currently, you need to contact your channel manager to add you to the allowlist if you want to use the customer service suspension rules.
>- The service suspension of your customer is only caused by the customer’s assets balance. You need to check the balance change in time.
>- If your customer’s service is suspended due to overdue payments, you need to pay the fees incurred in the service suspension grace period and data protection period.
>- Tencent Cloud is not liable for any consequences or disputes arising from your customer's overdue payments since it doesn't engage in the business between you and your customers.
