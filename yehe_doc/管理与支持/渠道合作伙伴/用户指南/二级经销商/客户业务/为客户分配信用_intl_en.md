>1. The credit is the credit limit available to a customer. It is calculated as published at the Tencent Cloud official website and excludes deductions from vouchers.
>2. Credit control is only a tool provided by Tencent Cloud for partners to control the approximate amount of credit available to customers. Due to the different billing modes and settlement cycles of Tencent Cloud services, there may be delays and differences in the monitoring of the fees incurred by customers.
>3. We will send alarm notifications to you when a customer has used more than 75%, 90%, and 100% of their credit.
>4. In the reseller mode, all fees incurred by customers are paid by the partner, so caution should be exercised.
>5. A credit will immediately take effect once set.

### 2. Repossessing Credit
You can enter a negative value for the **Allocated amount** field to repossess a customer’s available credit as needed. **The maximum credit you can repossess** must be not greater than **the customer’s available credit**.
