#### 1.2 Service Month(s)
Service Month(s): means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you.

The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

Only the time of Service Unavailability that lasts for one minute continuously or longer shall be counted toward Downtime. Service Unavailability that lasts for shorter than one minute shall not be counted toward Downtime.

#### 1.4 Unavailability
The Unavailability of the Service means the Service is interrupted due to a problem with the equipment, the data center or the product functions of the Tencent Cloud Service, or an improper operation by Tencent Cloud itself. Otherwise, the Service Unavailability shall not be deemed to occur, and the corresponding time of interruption shall not be counted toward Downtime.

### 2.   Service Availability

#### 2.1  Calculation of Service Availability
Service Availability = (1 – Downtime within a Service Month / Total Service Time within a Service Month) × 100%

#### 2.2  Service Availability/Service Indicator Standard
**The Service Availability of the Service provided by Tencent Cloud will be no less than 99.99%.** You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard, other than in any circumstance as provided in the Release of Liabilities provisions.

### 3.   Compensation Plan
In respect of the Service, if the Service Availability fails to meet the abovementioned standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

You cannot redeem such voucher for cash or request to issue an invoice for such voucher. Such voucher can only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account. You cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.
 - 2. If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned standard, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such Service Month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).
| Service  Availability in a Service Month      | Value of  Compensational Voucher   |
