## Subtitle Editing
Adopts advanced deep learning neural network algorithms to extract audio tracks from videos and convert them into text. Supports read & write subtitle files in SRT and VTT formats and imports from plain text files. At the same time, with a visualized subtitle editor, users can create and edit subtitles with ease by simple dragging them on the timeline.
## Subtitle Embedding
With the 1-click subtitle compression function, once the subtitles have been created, a single click of the video transcoding button and the subtitle compression is completed. The compression is processed with video encoded in H264, with mp4, mkv and other file formats available. Adding subtitles to your video can help your audience understand it better, which in turn elevates your video's quality.
