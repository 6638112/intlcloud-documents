### What kind of services does AI Transfy provide?
AI Transfy is a platform providing accurate video subtitle transcription, editing and compression services to users looking for multimedia subtitles. It offers both AI video translation and professional translation services to cater for users' different needs. It helps users generate media files suitable for use in their target markets through localized translation.

### What is the difference between AI video translation and professional translation?
 - Video subtitles translation: With AI technology, the audio track in the video submitted by user is identified and extracted as a subtitle file with dialogue timestamps and texts for machine translation. The video content shouldn't involve creative translation such as company name creation, advertising text, ancient poems, etc., nor should it include terms for specified profession fields such as academic terms, proper nouns, etc. The translation targets daily conversational content and aims at providing an overall understanding of the content. This service offers basic translations in various languages.
 - Professional translation: An advanced service offering video translations in a higher standard and with more customization (including multilingual, video compression, video post-production, subtitle effects, special subtitle formatting, and other customizations).

### How is the word count calculated?
Our calculation is based on the number of source words using CAT tools (usually with Trados). CAT tools can also calculate the repetition rate in the file and offer a corresponding discount for repeated words in the quotation, which in turn saves costs for clients.

### How do you ensure the quality of the translation?
We have a team of high caliber translation experts. Files are divided by their area of expertise and are allocated to translators specializing in the corresponding area for translation. Clients can provide us with their specific glossary to ensure consistency.  Once the translations are completed, they will be proofread by our proofreading team. The finalized texts will then be processed for post-production work such as typesetting, graphics processing, etc. This ensures quality translation with an appealing layout.

### Do you guarantee the confidentiality of the materials for translation?
The parties will enter into a Confidentiality Agreement so that measures can be taken to ensure confidentiality and control access to users' materials.

### Do you provide test translations?
We provide first-time client with a translation request for 8,000 or more words with a test translation for free in accordance with their actual needs.

### What is the detailed procedure of your translation service?
After the original file is submitted, a quotation will be provided for confirmation.
The parties will sign an agreement, pursuant to which user will pay a deposit and we will arrange the translation.
When the translation is completed, user will check and accept the file and pay the remaining fees.

### How do you solve objections to Tencent's human translation?
Due to cultural differences, there are often various ways of translating the same text, and so there may be certain texts which you may comprehend differently. But we strive to minimize this from happening and ensure the professionalism of the text. We offer to amend the translation for free pursuant to your understanding of the text or your preferred style to your satisfaction.

### Will you assist in maintaining industry terms?
Under normal circumstances, before a project commences, we will extract words which appear frequently in the project file, or those which are more technical based on our experience in previous projects, divide them into different modules and applications, come up with translations for them, and provide them to client for their confirmation. Once we have client's confirmation, these terms are strictly adhered to during the translation process. As the project progresses, these terms will be gradually added to the language database in the form of issue reports, so that they can be maintained continuously throughout the project to ensure consistency in the same applications.

### What is the difference between machine translation and human translation?
Translation is highly complicated and meticulous work. It requires professionals to translate and polish with ample time, instead of direct translating each word in a document. Machine translation can't fully comprehend cultural differences, nor can it grasp the deeper meanings hidden in words, but these are required to ensure the accuracy and success of a translated passage. While the accuracy of machine translation is indeed improving and getting closer to human translation, it's nevertheless an imitation and not superior.  As such, just like all AI technology, machine translation can't replace humans. It will only be humans' assistants, a kind of tool to make humans' work better. We will use advanced computer-assisted translation software e.g., Trados, CAT to enhance our translators' efficiency.
