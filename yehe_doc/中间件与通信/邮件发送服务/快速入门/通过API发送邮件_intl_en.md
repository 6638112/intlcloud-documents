## Emailing Through API
By connecting to TencentCloud API, you can use DMS to send emails in any application. Before using APIs, please make sure that you have familiarized yourself with the DMS service description and use limits.

Currently, DMS supports two emailing APIs:
 - Regular emailing: SendMail
This API sends emails with the same content to all recipients with no need to call an email template.

 - Template emailing: SendTemplatedMail
This API sends personalized emails based on a preconfigured email template and custom values. The email template needs to be called, and custom values need to be provided.

For more information on other APIs and their calling methods, please see the API Documentation.
