## Overview
This document describes how to send an email by using Tencent Cloud Direct Mail Service (DMS).

**Complete required settings before emailing**

Before using DMS to send an email, you need to complete required settings in the [DMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dms) first:

-   [Setting sender domain](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1070/38223)
    The sender domain is like an ID number during emailing. Each account must have a sender domain.

-   [Creating email template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1070/38224)
    An email template is used to send template emails in the console and send batch emails through the `SendTemplatedMail` API.

**Send emails in two ways**

-   [Emailing in console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1070/38226)
