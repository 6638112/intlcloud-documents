This document describes the overdue payment policy for **monthly subscribed** exclusive clusters.

### Notes

- When you no longer use clusters, terminate them as soon as possible to avoid further fee deductions.
- After clusters are terminated and repossessed, their data will be deleted and cannot be recovered.

### Expiration alert

Seven days before your monthly subscribed cluster expires, the system automatically pushes an expiration alert message to you every other day. All alert messages are sent to the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators by **email and SMS**.

### Overdue payment reminder

From the day when your monthly subscribed cluster expires, the system pushes an alert message of resource isolation due to overdue payment to you every other day. All alert messages are sent to the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators by **email and SMS**.

### Overdue payment policy

- If your account balance is sufficient and you previously enabled auto-renewal, the resource will be automatically renewed on the expiration date.
- Your cluster can be used normally within 7 days after expiration. If you renew it during this period, **the billing cycle of the renewed cluster will start from the expiration date of the previous cycle**.
- If you don't renew your cluster within 7 days after expiration, your cluster service will be suspended, and resources will be terminated. All data will be deleted and cannot be recovered. When your resources are terminated, your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.
