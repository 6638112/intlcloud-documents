### How to track my usage of emails under the Tencent Cloud SES?
You can view the usage data on the [Statistics](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ses/stats) page in the SES console and calculate fees based on the statistics and price as described in [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1084/39335).

No. In SES, postpaid means you only pay as you go.
