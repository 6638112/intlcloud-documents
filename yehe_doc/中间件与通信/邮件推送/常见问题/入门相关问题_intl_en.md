### How do I test email sending in some simple ways?
You can use your own accounts for testing. SES offers a free tier of 1,000 emails currently but does not offer test accounts.

### Can I send a large number of emails right from the start?
In principle, we do not limit the number of emails you send. After you connect to SES, you can set the number of sent emails on your own. The default upper limit on the number of emails sent per day is 300,000 by default. If you need to send more emails per day, please contact the sales team for an increase. However, from the perspective of protecting the IP reputation and stabilizing the email deliverability, we recommend you enable the warm-up plan when you start sending emails at the beginning and gradually increase the number of sent emails within 1â€“2 weeks until the demand is met.

### What is warm-up?
Warm-up is a way to establish a reputation for a new IP. Generally, all email service providers set a limit on the daily number of emails sent from an IP. You need to start with a smaller number of emails and gradually increase the number each day.
