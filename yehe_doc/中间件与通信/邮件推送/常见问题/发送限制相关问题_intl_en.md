### Is there a limit on the number of emails sent to the same email address in one hour?

### Are there any restrictions on the email subject format?
The email subject should be in UTF-8 format and contain no more than 998 characters. Otherwise, the email wonâ€™t be sent. Tencent Cloud recommends keeping the subject within 78 characters.

### Are there any restrictions on recipient email addresses when sending emails via API calls?
No. However, the recipient email addresses must be valid (not obtained by crawling or purchased from a third-party) and active triggers or subscriptions from the recipients are required.

### What should I do to be able to send custom content?
Customers who have enabled the feature to send custom content will need to undertake the risk that their accounts are placed under review due to sending illegal and harmful information. It will hurt your sender reputation if your email address is out of control or used to send spams. In serious cases, the ESP will block your sender domain. To enable this feature, you need to contact your sales reps to do it for you.

### Is there a daily limit on the number of emails sent by a Tencent Cloud account?

### Is there a limit on the frequency of sending emails?
The default frequency limit for each account is 20 times per second. You can change the frequency limit.
