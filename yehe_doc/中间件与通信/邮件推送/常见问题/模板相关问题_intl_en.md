### What are the content standards for email templates?
The template must reflect the actual business, and the message meaning and scenario must be identifiable through the text content (excluding variables). The business types of different templates of the same user must be the same, and if there are special circumstances, they should be explained in advance.
**Word count requirements**: at least 150 words for marketing emails; at least 50 words for notification, transactional, and testing emails; no word limit for trigger-based emails.
**Variables**: keep the ratio of variables to text less than or equal to 1:5. Variable-only templates are not supported.
**Number of images**: do not include more than 50 images in an email. Image-only templates (i.e., templates with only image but no text) are not supported.
**Content requirements (including but not limited to the following requirements)**
