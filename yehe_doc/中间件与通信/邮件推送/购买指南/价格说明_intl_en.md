SES is pay-as-you-go.

## Pay-As-You-Go
You will be charged according to your actual usage at 0.0005 USD per email. Up to 300,000 emails can be sent per day by default. You can raise this limit.
## Free Tier
Each Tencent Cloud account is entitled to a free tier of 1,000 emails. You will be billed for emails sent beyond the free tier.
## Rules for Suspense of Service
SES uses a daily pay-as-you-go billing cycle. In other words, Tencent Cloud will generate a bill based on your daily usage and deduct the corresponding amount from your account balance. If your account balance is insufficient and the deduction fails, Tencent Cloud will suspend the service, in which case you will not be able to use SES. Service will automatically resume once you top up your account balance.
