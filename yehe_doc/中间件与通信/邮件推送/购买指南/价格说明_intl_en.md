SES is pay-as-you-go now and no longer supports resource packages.

## Resource Package

- You can continue to use your existing resource packages before they expire, and the remaining amount after the expiration cannot be refunded.
- The validity periods of different resource packages are calculated separately. Email usage will be deducted first from valid resource packages in order of expiration time.
- After all resource packages are used up, the email service can still be used and will become pay-as-you-go.
- If your account is used to send non-compliant content, we will block your account, and your remaining resource package balance cannot be refunded.


## Pay-as-You-Go
Fees are charged by the actual usage at the price of 0.00028 USD/email.
## Free Tier
Each Tencent Cloud account is entitled to a free tier of 1,000 emails. You will be billed for emails sent beyond the free tier.
## Service Suspension
SES uses a daily pay-as-you-go billing cycle. In other words, Tencent Cloud will generate a bill based on your daily usage and deduct the corresponding amount from your account balance. If your account balance is insufficient and the deduction fails, Tencent Cloud will suspend the service, in which case you will not be able to use SES. Service will automatically resume once you top up your account balance.
