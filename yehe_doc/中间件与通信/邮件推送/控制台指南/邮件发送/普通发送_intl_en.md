## Directions
1. Log in to the [SES console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ses/send) and click **Email Sending** > **Email Sending** to enter the **Email Sending** page.

2. Select an email template, enter a subject, select a sender address, enter recipient addresses, and click **Send** to send the email.
>?You can configure up to 20 recipient addresses at a time. You can't configure different variable values for different recipients in the template. If you need this capability, use the [batch sending](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1084/47542) feature.
