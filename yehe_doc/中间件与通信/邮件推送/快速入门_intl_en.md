## Notes
- You must have the admin permissions on the sender domain.
- If your domain is hosted on Tencent Cloud, log in to the [DNSPod console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cns) to configure the domain. Otherwise, configure it as instructed in the checklist.
- It takes five minutes to two hours to sync the domain configuration. Please wait patiently.
- After the domain verification is completed, do not delete or modify the configured SPF and MX records to avoid errors in email sending.
- Do not use a corporate email domain to avoid SPF and MX records conflicts. Instead, you can create and use a second-level domain under your existing corporate email domain.
- Each Tencent Cloud account can be configured with up to 10 domains.

## Step 1. Log in to the console[](id:Step1)
Log in to the [SES console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ses). If you do not have a Tencent Cloud account yet, see [Signing Up for a Tencent Cloud Account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) to create one.

## Step 2. Conduct identity verification[](id:Step2)
If the identity of your account is not verified, conduct identity verification in the [Account Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer). For more information, see [Identity Verification Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Step 3. Activate SES[](id:Step3)
If the identity of your account is verified, click **Activate** to activate SES. After successful activation, you will get a free tier of 1,000 emails.

## Step 4. Configure a sender domain[](id:Step4)
