Global SMS provides various services such as SMS verification code, system notification, and event notification, meeting your diverse needs in basic services and marketing campaigns.

### Signature Customization
An SMS signature is an identifier added before the message text for identification of a company or business. You can use the name or abbreviation of your company, trademark, product, or website as the signature.

### Body Template
The SMS body content can be verification code, system notification, member-targeted marketing, etc. An SMS body template allows you to use parameters (variables) to customize the SMS body content, which can be shared by Chinese Mainland SMS and Global SMS.

### SMS Message Delivery
After both the SMS body template and signature are approved, you can send SMS messages through the SMS console, APIs, or SDKs.

### Status Notification
After an SMS message is sent, you can view the SMS message delivery status (successful or failed) and the actual number of fragment messages (if the body template contains variable parameters, the final number of fragment messages may be affected) in the console.

### Unauthorized Usage Protection
Global SMS sends alarms for excessive messages every calender day. If the number of sent SMS messages exceeds the specified limit, the system will send an alarm notification to the specified alarm recipient to help reduce or avoid the loss caused by unauthorized usage.
Up to 1,000 Global SMS messages can be sent per day under one Tencent Cloud account. If you need to adjust this limit, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
