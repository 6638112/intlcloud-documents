SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.

>!
>- API version required for connecting to Tencent Cloud International
>  SMS API v2021-01-11 is required. For details, see the sample code.
>- SMS sending APIs
>  One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>  Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".



## Prerequisites
- You have learned about the concept of [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13299#.E5.9C.B0.E5.9F.9F) and selected a region as needed.
- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started with Mainland China SMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35449).
- You have prepared the dependent environment: JDK 7 or above.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The endpoint of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents

- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java).


## Installing SDK

### Installing through Maven (recommended)

[Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is a dependency management tool for Java that supports the dependencies your project requires and installs them into your project.

1. Go to [Maven's official website](https://maven.apache.org/) to download the corresponding Maven installation package for your system and install it.
2. Add Maven dependencies by adding the following dependencies in Maven's pom.xml:

 >!The version number here is for demonstration only. Please get the latest version number in [Maven Repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java) for replacement.
<pre><code class="language-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">dependency</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">groupId</span>&gt;</span>com.tencentcloudapi<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">groupId</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">artifactId</span>&gt;</span>tencentcloud-sdk-java<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">artifactId</span>&gt;</span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">version</span>&gt;</span>3.1.270<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">version</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- Note: the version number here is for demonstration only and can be used directly. You can get the <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.tencentcloudapi/tencentcloud-sdk-java">latest version number</a> for replacement. Be sure not to use v4.0.x (which is not the latest version) --&gt;</span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">dependency</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>
3. For importing methods, please see the [sample code](#example).

### Installing through source package

1. [Download](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java) the source code package.
2. Decompress the source package to an appropriate location in your project.
3. Put the jar package under the `vendor` directory in a path that can be found by Java.
4. For importing methods, please see the [sample code](#example).

## Sample Code[](id:example)

>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2021-01-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features as shown below:

## FAQs
<dx-accordion>
::: Failure to update the dependencies in the repository's \spom.xml\s file
This may be because the local server has a proxy configured, but the proxy is not configured for the tool during the update. Please update the dependencies on the command line as detailed above. If the problem persists, you need to check whether the problem is caused by network or firewall issues.
:::
::: Failure to run the demo
In `[TencentCloudSDKException]message:java.net.ConnectException-Connection timed out: connect requestId:`, you need to check whether the local server has a proxy configured but the proxy is not added in the code. For more information, please see below:
```
HttpProfile httpProfile = new HttpProfile();
httpProfile.setProxyHost("real proxy IP");
httpProfile.setProxyPort(real proxy port);
```
:::
::: Version upgrade
Please note that upgrading from v3.0.x to 3.1.x causes compatibility issues. As `integer` fields have been modified to `long` type, the project needs to be recompiled.
:::
::: Dependency conflict
Currently, the SDK depends on OkHttp 2.5.0. If it is mixed with other packages that depend on OkHttp 3, an error may be reported, such as `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: okio.BufferedSource.rangeEquals(JLokio/ByteString;)Z`.

The reason is that OkHttp 3 depends on Okio 1.12.0, while OkHttp 2.5.0 depends on Okio 1.6.0. When Maven parses dependencies, it gives top priority to the shortest path in sequence, so if the SDK is declared in the pom.xml dependency first, Okio 1.6.0 will be used, and an error will be reported.

Solution before the SDK is upgraded to OkHttp 3:
1. Clearly specify the dependency on Okio 1.12.0 in pom.xml (note that there may be other packages that require a higher version, in which case, take the highest version as a workaround).
2. Put the SDK at the end of the dependency (note that if it has been compiled before, you need to delete the OkHttp package cached by Maven first). Taking the CMQ SDK that depends on OkHttp 3 as an example, the format is as follows (pay attention to the workaround version number): 
```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.qcloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>cmq-http-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.7</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.tencentcloudapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>tencentcloud-sdk-java</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.59</version>
    </dependency>
```
:::
::: Certificate issue
Certificate issues are usually caused by incorrect configuration of the client environment. The SDK does not manipulate the certificate and relies on the processing by the Java runtime environment itself. After a certificate issue occurs, you can run `-Djavax.net.debug=ssl` to enable detailed logs for troubleshooting.

Some users reported that the certificate error `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure` occurred while using IBM JDK 1.8. The error was resolved after Oracle JDK was used.
