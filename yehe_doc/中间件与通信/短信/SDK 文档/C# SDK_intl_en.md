SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
>!
>- API version required for connecting to Tencent Cloud International
>SMS API v2021-01-11 is required. For details, see the sample code.
>- SMS sending APIs
>One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".



## Prerequisites

- You have learned about the concept of [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13299#.E5.9C.B0.E5.9F.9F) and selected a region as needed.
- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35452).
- You have prepared the dependent environments: .NET Framework 4.5+ and .NET Core 2.1.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The endpoint of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents
- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-dotnet).

## Installing SDK
### Installing through NuGet (recommended)

1. Run the following installation command:
```
dotnet add package TencentCloudSDK --version 3.0.0
```
 Other information can be obtained through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TencentCloudSDK/).
2. Add the package through Visual Studio.

### Installing through source package
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-dotnet) or [quick download address](https://tencentcloud-sdk-1253896243.file.myqcloud.com/tencentcloud-sdk-dotnet/tencentcloud-sdk-dotnet.zip) to download the latest code.
2. After decompressing, install it in the working directory.
3. Use Visual Studio 2017 to open the compilation.


## Sample Code
>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2021-01-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features as shown below:

## FAQs
<dx-accordion>
::: Proxy settings
If you use the SDK to call an API in a proxy environment, you need to set the system environment variable `https_proxy` (as shown in the sample code); otherwise, it may not be called normally, and a connection timeout exception will be thrown.
:::
::: Sync and async calls
The new version of the SDK provides both async and sync APIs. The sync APIs uniformly have the `Sync` suffix after the async APIs as demonstrated in the code above.


>!In the sample, as it is a console application, you can call the async APIs synchronously, i.e., `ConfigureAwait(false).GetAwaiter().GetResult()`. When developing ASP applications or Windows Forms applications, you cannot call the async APIs synchronously in the response method of UI controls; otherwise, the UI will stop responding.
>The solution is to change the response method of the UI controls to async and pay attention to the sync context. In addition, as async call immediately returns control to the user, it is prone to cause the user to click multiple times or perform unexpected operations. Such problems should be avoided in the program. For the source code, please refer to the `WindowsFormsDemo` project.
>:::
>::: Dependent version
>The `FluentClient` on which the SDK depends is on v3.2, but this package is currently available on v4.0, which is incompatible with lower versions. Upgrading this package to v4.0 in NuGet will cause problems such as inability to call or call failure.
