SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
>!
>- API version required for connecting to Tencent Cloud International
>SMS API v2021-01-11 is required. For details, see the sample code.
>- SMS sending APIs
>One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".


## Prerequisites

- You have learned about the concept of [region](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/13299#.E5.9C.B0.E5.9F.9F) and selected a region as needed.
- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started with Mainland China SMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35449).
- You have prepared the dependent environment: PHP 5.6.33 or above.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The endpoint of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents
- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40463).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-php).

## Installing SDK


[Composer](https://www.phpcomposer.com) is a dependency management tool for PHP that supports the dependencies your project requires and installs them into your project.
1. Install Composer.
 - For Windows, go to [Composer official website](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download the installation package and install it.
 - For Unix, run the following command to install Composer:
```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
sudo mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
```
2. Add dependencies.
```
composer require tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-php
```
3. Add the following reference code in the code.
>!This example is for reference only. Composer will generate a `vendor` directory in the project root directory, whose actual absolute path is `/path/to/`. If the operation is executed in the project root directory, you can omit the absolute path.
>
```
require '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';
```

## Sample Code[](id:example)
>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2021-01-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features as shown below:

### Sending SMS message

     * You can also write the key pair directly into the code, but be careful not to copy, upload, or share the code to others;

## FAQs[](id:point)
<dx-accordion>
::: Certificate issue
If there is a problem with your PHP environment certificate, errors similar to `cURL error 60: See http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html` may occur, which can be solved as follows:

1. Download the certificate file `cacert.pem` at https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and save it to the PHP installation path.
2. Edit the `php.ini` file: delete the semicolon comment (;) before the `curl.cainfo` configuration item and set the value to the absolute path of the saved certificate file `cacert.pem`.
3. Restart the services that depend on PHP.
:::
::: php_curl\s extension
GuzzleHttp, which this SDK depends on, needs to have the php_curl extension enabled. Check whether the php.ini environment in your environment is enabled. For example, on Linux with PHP 7.1, for services hosted under Apache, you can open `/etc/php/7.1/apache2/php.ini` to see whether the `extension=php_curl.dll` configuration item has been commented. Please delete the comment before it and restart Apache.
:::
::: Web\s access exception
The command is executed normally on the command line, but when it is executed on the web server, the following error is reported:

`cURL error 0: The cURL request was retried 3 times and did not succeed. The most likely reason for the failure is that cURL was unable to rewind the body of the request and subsequent retries resulted in the same error. Turn on the debug option to see what went wrong. See https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=47204 for more information. (see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/libcurl-errors.html)`

This error may occur in different cases. You can run `php -r "echo sys_get_temp_dir();"` to print the absolute path of the default system temporary directory and set `sys_temp_dir` in `php.ini` to this value, and then check whether this error is fixed.
:::
::: Problem with installation through source code
In order to satisfy the need for installation through source code, we previously put the dependent package files in the `vendor` directory. However, considering that incompatibility with Composer should not be caused, we had to forbid importing the `vendor` directory on GitHub, which resulted in the problem where the `git clone` command had to be used to get the `vendor` directory. This practice caused confusion for some users not familiar with GitHub. Therefore, starting from v3.0.188, we have temporarily removed the method of installation through source code, and Composer must be used to install the SDK and dependent packages.
:::
::: Proxy settings
If there is a proxy in your environment, you need to set the system environment variable `https_proxy`; otherwise, it may not be called normally, and a connection timeout exception will be thrown.
You can also use `GuzzleHttp` to configure the proxy:
```php
$cred = new Credential("secretId", "secretKey");

$httpProfile = new HttpProfile();
$httpProfile->setProxy('https://ip:port');

$clientProfile = new ClientProfile();
$clientProfile->setHttpProfile($httpProfile);
```
