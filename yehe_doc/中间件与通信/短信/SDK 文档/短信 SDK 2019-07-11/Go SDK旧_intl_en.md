SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
>!
>- SMS sending APIs
>One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".


## Prerequisites

- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started with Mainland China SMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35449).
- If you need to send Mainland China SMS messages, you need to purchase a Mainland China SMS package first.
- You have prepared the dependent environment: Go 1.9 or above.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The endpoint of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents
- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-go).

## Installing SDK
### Installing through go get (recommended)
We recommend you install the SDK by using the tool that comes with the language:
```
 go get -u github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-go
```

### Installing through source code
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-go) or [quick download address](https://tencentcloud-sdk-1253896243.file.myqcloud.com/tencentcloud-sdk-go/tencentcloud-sdk-go.zip) to download the latest code.
2. Decompress and install in the `$GOPATH/src/github.com/tencentcloud` directory.

## Sample Code
>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2021-01-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features as shown below:
