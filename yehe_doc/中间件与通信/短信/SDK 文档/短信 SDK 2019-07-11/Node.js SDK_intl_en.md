SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
>!
>- SMS sending APIs
>One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".


## Prerequisites

- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started with Mainland China SMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35449).
- If you need to send Mainland China SMS messages, you need to purchase a Mainland China SMS package first.
- You have prepared the dependent environment: Node.js 7.10.1 or above.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The endpoint of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents
- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs).

## Installing SDK
### Installing through npm (recommended)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package management tool for Node.js.

1. Run the following installation command:
```
npm install tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs --save
```
2. Refer to the corresponding module code in your code. For more information, please see the [sample code](#example).

### Installing through source package
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs) or [quick download address](https://tencentcloud-sdk-1253896243.file.myqcloud.com/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs.zip) to download the source code package.
2. Decompress the source package to an appropriate location in your project.
3. Refer to the corresponding module code in your code. For more information, please see the [sample code](#example).


## Sample Code[](id:example)
>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2019-07-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features.


### Applying for SMS template
```
const tencentcloud = require("tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs")

// Import the client models of the corresponding product module
const smsClient = tencentcloud.sms.v20190711.Client

   * The example here uses the way to read from the environment variable, so you need to set these two values in the environment variable first.
   * You can also write the key pair directly into the code, but be careful not to copy, upload, or share the code to others;
   * otherwise, the key pair may be leaked, causing damage to your properties.

::: Proxy settings
If there is a proxy in your environment, you need to set the system environment variable `https_proxy`; otherwise, it may not be called normally, and a connection timeout exception will be thrown.
