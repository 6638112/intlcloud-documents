CKafka offers a quick diagnosis feature to help you automatically check potential health issues of your cluster, suggest solutions based on Tencent Cloud experts' experience, and generate a health check report for you. This feature can extract key information, locate problems, and offer professional suggestions, thus delivering a closed-loop Ops experience.

> ?Currently, the quick diagnosis feature is only available for CKafka Pro Edition instances and can be used for diagnosis only once every day; therefore, we recommend you use it reasonably.
