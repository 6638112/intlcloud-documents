## Overview

DataHub supports accessing different types of data generated by various data sources for unified management and distribution to downstream offline/online processing systems, forming a clear data flow channel.

This document takes HTTP data as an example to describe how to create an active data reporting task and modify the task configuration in the CKafka console.

## Directions

### Creating data access task

**Prerequisites**: You have created a CKafka instance and a topic.


1. Log in to the [CKafka console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka).
2. Click **Data Access** on the left sidebar, select the region, and click **Create Task**.
3. In the pop-up window, select **Actively reported data** for **Data Source Type**.

   - Task Name: Enter the task name. It can only contain letters, digits, underscores, or symbols ("-" and ".").
   - Target CKafka Instance: Select the target CKafka instance.
   - Target Topic: Select the target CKafka topic for data shipping. The data distribution feature cannot be normally used if ACL policies are configured for the selected topic.
   - Schema: After a schema is associated, it will be used to verify data format. If there is no appropriate schema, you can click [Create Schema](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka/datahub-schema?rid=8&createStatus=true) to enter the schema creation page.
   - QPS Limit: Enter the QPS limit.
5. Click **Submit**. After the task is created successfully, access point information will be generated.
6. Copy the access point information to the SDK to write data.

### Modifying data target

1. Log in to the [CKafka console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka).
2. Click **Data Access** on the left sidebar and click the **ID** of the target task to enter its basic information page.
3. Click **Change Data Target** in the top-right corner of the **Data Access** module to modify the data access target.

> ?
>
> - You can switch only the target CKafka topic. The target CKafka instance cannot be modified.
> - The new data target will take effect in about one minute.
> - The access point will not be generated again after the data target is modified.

4. Click **Submit**.


### Associating/Disassociating schema

If you don't associate a schema during task creation, you can associate one later. Schemas can also be disassociated. The steps are as follows:

1. Log in to the [CKafka console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka).
2. Click **Data Access** on the left sidebar and click the **ID** of the target task to enter its basic information page. In the basic information module, you can associate/disassociate schemas.


### Viewing monitoring data

1. Log in to the [CKafka console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka).
2. Click **Data Access** on the left sidebar and click the **ID** of the target task to enter its basic information page.
3. Select the **Monitoring** tab to view the monitoring data of the target topic.


### Pausing task

On the **[Data Access](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka/datahub-access)** page, click **Pause** in the **Operation** column of the target task to pause the task.

> ?If you find that the data access task affects the normal use of CKafka, you can pause it.


### Resuming task

On the **[Data Access](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka/datahub-access)** page, click **Resume** in the **Operation** column of the target task to resume the paused task.

> ?A paused task can be resumed to continue dumping data.


### Deleting task

On the **[Data Access](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka/datahub-access)** page, click **Delete** in the **Operation** column of the target task and click **OK** in the pop-up window to delete the task.

> ?
>
> - Once the task is deleted, data dumping will be stopped and the task record will be deleted, but the previously dumped data and CKafka instance involved will not be affected.
> - A task cannot be recovered once deleted. Proceed with caution.
