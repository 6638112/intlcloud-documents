## Overview

DataHub supports accessing different types of data generated by various data sources for unified management and distribution to downstream offline/online processing systems, forming a clear data flow channel.

This document takes DTS data as an example to describe how to create an async data pull task and modify the task configuration in the CKafka console.

## Directions
