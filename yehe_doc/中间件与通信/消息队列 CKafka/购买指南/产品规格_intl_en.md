| Stability SLA                        | 99.995%                                                      | 99.95%                                                       |
| Instance specification | There are no fixed models, and the specifications can be customized according to the actual business scenario | There are 8 fixed instance types, including small, standard, and advanced |
| <nobr>Topic/Partition specification</nobr> | <li> | The topic/partition capacity is much larger than that on the Standard Edition under the same bandwidth.</li> <li>Additional partition packages can be purchased within a certain range to increase the upper limit.</li> | Each model has a fixed upper limit |
| Scalability | Its scalability is high, and the upper limits of bandwidth, topics/partitions, and disks can be increased separately | Its scalability is low, and its disk can be expanded separately |
| Performance tuning | The performance can be customized according to the business scenario with fewer parameter restrictions | The numbers of topics and partitions are limited according to the different instance specifications |
| Automatic disk cleanup | Available. Expired data is cleared automatically | Unavailable.
