## Overview

When encountering a consumption exception, you can troubleshoot the problem by querying the message in the CKafka console. This document describes how to query messages in the CKafka console.

The console supports query by offset and time, which are used in different scenarios:
- Query by offset: you know the ID of a topicâ€™s partition to which the message is sent and the offset of the message.
- Query by time: you are not sure about the offset of the message but know when the message is sent.

>! 
>- The console does not list all the messages after the specified time or offset. You can query at most 20 messages at a time.
>- Refrain from frequent querying as message querying consumes bandwidth too.

## Directions
