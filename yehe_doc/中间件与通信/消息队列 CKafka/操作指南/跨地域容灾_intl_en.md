## Overview

For applications with high requirements of service continuity, data reliability, and compliance, CKafka Pro Edition provides intra-instance replication and migration solutions by deploying disaster recovery systems across regions. When the primary system fails, the business will be switched over to the disaster recovery system, helping you avoid system failures caused by the regional disaster, enhance your capability to deliver continued services at low costs, and improve data reliability.

>?
>- Currently, only CKafka Pro Edition instances can provide the cross-region disaster recovery capability.
>- The cross-region disaster recovery feature is now available in Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tokyo regions. Users in other regions can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to use this feature.
