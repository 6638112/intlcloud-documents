## Overview

CKafka transfers data over the private network by default. To access over the public network, you need to activate a public network route separately. For detailed directions, see [Adding Routing Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/32555). Currently, public network bandwidth of 3 Mbps is provided free of charge by default.

CKafka Pro Edition allows you to increase the bandwidth of the public network. You can pay for more public network bandwidth if you require it. For the specific prices, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/11745).


This document describes how to upgrade, adjust, and delete the public network bandwidth in the CKafka console.

## Directions

CKafka adjusted the purchase entry and mode of public network bandwidth on January 7, 2022. After then, new users can purchase a public network bandwidth during instance purchase, and existing instances continue to be billed by the hourly bandwidth, which can be upgraded.

You can click the following tags to view the purchase methods and relevant operations for old and new instances.
