## Overview
CKafka offers a quick diagnosis feature that can proactively troubleshoot cluster problems and risks, provide solutions based on Tencent Cloud experts' experience, and automatically generate reports from health check results. This feature can also extract key information, locate problems, and offer professional suggestions, thus delivering a closed-loop OPS experience.

> ?Currently, the quick diagnosis feature is only available for **CKafka Pro Edition** instances and can be used for diagnosis only once every day; therefore, we recommend you use it reasonably.
