The performance comparison between CKafka and open-source Apache Kafka is detailed as follows:

| Feature       | CKafka                                                       | Apache Kafka                                                 |
<<<<<<< HEAD
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Basic features   | Supports adjusting topic parameter configurations and the number of topic partitions, sending messages, and resetting the consumption offset in the console; supports visual management for clusters, topics, and consumer groups. | Topic parameters and the number of partitions can only be configured with command lines in a non-customized manner; message sending is not supported; the consumption offset must be reset manually, which is complicated and error-prone; and an open-source management system is required, making Apache Kafka less user-friendly. |
| Smart Ops | Supports automatic disk capacity scaling, quick diagnosis, smart inspection (with solutions provided), and smart disk configuration. | Not supported.                                                     |
| Isolation     | The following features are supported: creating multiple instances based on one physical cluster; usage limit based on bandwidth and disk capacity; topic-level traffic throttling; the configuration of multiple access points; the isolation between the control plane and data plane; logically isolating cross-account data. | Not supported.                                                     |
| Monitoring and alarming   | Offers out-of-the-box deployment and monitoring solutions that are mature and standardized; supports multidimensional monitoring and alarming, metric sorting, and viewing the details of logs (such as exception event logs) in the console for troubleshooting. | Not supported.                                                     |
| High availability     | Supports high-availability and multi-AZ deployment and offers mature failure recovery solutions; supports upgrading from single-AZ deployment to multi-AZ deployment as well as cross-region disaster recovery. | Supported, but the process is time-consuming.                                             |
| Security compliance | Supports ACL in topic dimension; supports configuring SASL and SSL authentication in the console; supports the permission control for management and control operations (which are rewindable) via CloudAudit | Parameters need to be configured with command lines, which is complicated and error-prone; operations are non-rewindable.     |
| Others       | You can seamlessly upgrade CKafka to a new version when the community edition has bugs or security vulnerabilities. | N/A                                                     |

| Throughput     | Very high                                                       | High                                                         |

| Cost       | Very flexible billing based on your estimated peak traffic and disk capacity             | High costs with labor and Ops environment required                        |
| Ops       | Complete monitoring and alarming system, Ops ticket system, and CKafka R&D experts who answer questions at any time to quickly solve your problems | Cumbersome Ops and deployment where it is difficult to locate problems                |
| Scalability   | Very flexible and easy to scale. Only the VIP address needs to be specified for message sending, and broker changes are imperceptible for both message sending and receiving | Not flexible enough. The broker address needs to be specified to send messages, and ZooKeeper coordination scheduling is required for message receiving |
| Availability     | Very high availability. Automatic leader/follower switch is supported. CKafka guarantees an availability of 99.95%     | High availability. Automatic leader/follower switch is supported. Messages may be lost after switch due to async flush and replication |
| Message reliability | <li>High reliability </li><li>Reliability can be further improved based on the three-copy mechanism, and the cluster features better disaster recovery where failures rarely occur</li>| <li>Low reliability </li><li>The broker has only async flush and async primary/secondary replication mechanisms, which may cause message loss</li> |

>?
>- "2-core 4 GB stress test" indicates the result of a stress test on a server with 2 CPU cores and 4 GB memory.
>- CKafka is compatible with the producer and consumer APIs of Apache Kafka 0.9 and later. To connect to a self-built Kafka instance on a legacy version (such as 0.8), API modification is needed.
