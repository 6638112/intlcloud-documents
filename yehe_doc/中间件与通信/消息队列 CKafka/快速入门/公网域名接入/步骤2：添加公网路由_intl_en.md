## Overview

To enable public network access, you need to add a public route for the instance. This document describes how to add a public route for a created instance in the CKafka console.

## Prerequisites

You have [created an instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/40044).

## Directions

1. On the [Instance List](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ckafka/index?rid=1) page, click the ID/name of the instance created in [step 1](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/597/40044).
2. On the **Instance Details** page, click **Add a routing policy** in the **Access Mode** section to add a public route.
