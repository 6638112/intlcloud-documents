The TDMQ for Pulsar console was upgraded to support CAM authorization for all resource levels from cluster to topic on July 9, 2021. After the upgrade, some sub-accounts will have no permissions to view and manipulate unauthorized resources.

You can prompt the root account to authorize resources in the CAM console as instructed [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1110/42935).

Be assured that the permissions in the console **do not affect** business data streams.
