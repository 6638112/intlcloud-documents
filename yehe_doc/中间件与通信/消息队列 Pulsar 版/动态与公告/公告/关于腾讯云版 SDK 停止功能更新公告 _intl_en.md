In order to be more consistent with the Pulsar open-source community, we have stopped feature updates for the Tencent Cloud SDK since April 30, 2021. We recommend you use the Apache Pulsar SDK.

If you are using the Tencent Cloud SDK, and you are sure that you don't use the features of tag filtering and backoff delayed message, you can directly replace it with the Apache Pulsar SDK.

For more information, see the [SDK documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1110/42945).
