## Overview

Topic is a core concept in TDMQ for Pulsar. It is usually used to categorize and manage various messages produced by the system in a centralized manner; for example, messages related to transactions can be placed in a topic named "trade" for other consumers to subscribe to.
In actual application scenarios, a topic often represents a business category. You can decide how to design different topics based on your system and data architectures.

This document describes how to use topics to categorize and manage messages in TDMQ for Pulsar.
