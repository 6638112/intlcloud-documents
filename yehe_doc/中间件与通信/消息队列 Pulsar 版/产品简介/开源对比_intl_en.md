The performance comparison between TDMQ for Pulsar and open-source Apache Pulsar is detailed below:


| Item      | TDMQ for Pulsar                                               | Apache Pulsar                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Strengths        | <li>It supports on-demand usage and the pay-as-you-go billing mode, eliminating your need to care about configuration.</li><li>It is Ops-free, eliminating your need to care about the underlying components.</li><li>It can send/receive messages over the HTTP protocol via TencentCloud API, which is easy to use.</li><li>It natively supports basic capabilities such as Tencent Cloud CM and CAM.</li><li>It has a high SLA, and its parameters are fine-tuned in a targeted manner.</li> | <li>It offers new open-source features in time.</li><li>It allows configuring some parameters more flexibly.</li> |
| Shortcomings        | It generally takes two to three months to add a new open-source feature.                   | <li>It depends on a large number of components and therefore has a high Ops workload.</li><li>It doesn't provide an SLA.</li><li>Its security protection capabilities are limited.</li><li>It cannot be configured precisely, which causes resource waste.</li> |
| General performance    | Hundreds of thousands of QPS                                                   | Hundreds of thousands of QPS                                                   |
| Costs        | It supports the pay-as-you-go billing mode, which is elastic, has a reasonable resource usage, makes costs controllable, and requires no manual Ops.  | Self-built message queues cannot be used elastically and have a low resource utilization but high costs. They require manual maintenance and incur high Ops costs.  |
| Scalability    | It is very flexible and easy to scale. You don't need to pay attention to the scaling process and can fully utilize the scale effect to sustain sudden high loads. | Broker nodes can be flexibly added, but it is complex to manually scale out a BookKeeper cluster, during which maloperations can easily occur and affect the data. |
| Availability      | It is deployed across multiple AZs and stores messages in three replicas in different AZs. Tencent Cloud guarantees an availability of above 99.95% and provides cluster traffic throttling and optimization to prevent the cluster from being crashed by high traffic.  | You need to deploy it in different regions to guarantee the availability and ensure the cluster availability in case of a high traffic load on your own. |
| Security protection    | It natively supports security protection capabilities by using Tencent Cloud security products.                                 | You need to install and configure open-source plugins.                                         |
| Monitoring and alarming    | It natively supports monitoring and alarming capabilities with the aid of CM.                                 | You need to install and configure open-source plugins.                                         |
