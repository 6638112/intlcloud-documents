## Overview
Starting from v1.3.3.0, the TPNS SDK supports connection to the HONOR Push channel. This channel is a system-level push channel officially provided by HONOR. On an HONOR phone, push messages can be delivered through HONOR's system channel without opening the application. For more information, see [HONOR Push Overview](https://developer.hihonor.com/doc/guides/100220).

>?
> - Currently, the HONOR channel only supports HONOR devices on Magic UI 6.0 or later, while older HONOR devices can use the Huawei Push channel instead. In the future, the HONOR channel will also support HONOR devices on Magic UI 5.0 and 4.0.
> - To apply for the activation of the HONOR Push service, you need an HONOR business/organization developer account.
> - For HONOR Push, you can successfully register with the vendor channel and push messages through it only in a signed package environment.

## Directions

### Step 1. Get the key
1. Sign up for an HONOR developer account [here](https://developer.hihonor.com/) and log in. For more information, see [Registration](https://developer.hihonor.com/cn/doc/guides/100084). (To use HONOR Push, you need to register a business/organization developer account.)
2. Create an application on the HONOR Developers platform, enter the application information such as application package name and certificate fingerprint, and activate the push service. For more information, see [here](https://developer.hihonor.com/doc/guides/100221). For how to get the application certificate fingerprint, see the **1.1 Development Environment** section in [HONOR Push Android Development Documentation](https://developer.hihonor.com/doc/guides/100223).
3. Copy and paste the `AppId`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` parameters of the application into corresponding fields in **[TPNS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns)** > **Configuration Management** > **Basic Configuration** > **HONOR Official Push Channel**.


### Step 2. Configure items
Choose either of the following integration methods.
#### Integrating through Android Studio

Complete the configuration required by TPNS in the `build.gradle` file in the **Application** module and then add the following nodes:
1. Configure the HONOR Push `AppID`. The sample code is as follows:
```xml
 manifestPlaceholders = [
	 HONOR_APPID  : "xxxx"
        ]
```
2. Import the HONOR Push dependencies. The sample code is as follows:
```groovy
implementation 'com.tencent.tpns:honor:[VERSION]-release'
```

>? 
> - For HONOR Push, [VERSION] is the version number of the current SDK and can be obtained from the [SDK for Android](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/36191), which is supported starting from v1.3.3.0.
> - HONOR Push is compatible with the preset `<queries>` tag on Android 11. Upgrade Android Studio to v3.6.1 or later, and upgrade the Android Gradle plugin to v3.5.4 or later; otherwise, an error may occur when you build the project.


#### Integrating through Eclipse
After getting the TPNS SDK package for HONOR Push, configure the major TPNS version and the following content in the manual integration method detailed on TPNS official website.

1. Download the [SDK installation package](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns/sdkdownload).
2. Open the `Other-Push-jar` folder and import the HONOR Push JAR package.
2. Add the following configuration to the `Androidmanifest.xml` file:
```xml
    <application>
        <receiver
            android:name="com.hihonor.push.sdk.PushReceiver"
            android:exported="true"
            android:permission="${applicationId}.hihonor.permission.PROCESS_PUSH_MSG">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.hihonor.push.action.REGISTRATION" />
                <action android:name="com.hihonor.push.action.RECEIVE" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>

        <provider
            android:name="com.hihonor.push.sdk.init.AutoInitProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.hihonor.autoinitprovider"
            android:exported="false"
            android:initOrder="500" />

        <!-- Custom HONOR push callback service -->
        <service
            android:name="com.tencent.android.tpush.honor.HonorMessageService"
            android:exported="false">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.hihonor.push.action.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
            </intent-filter>
        </service>

        <meta-data
            android:name="com.hihonor.push.sdk_version"
            android:value="6.0.3.102" />

        <!-- HONOR Push appId -->
        <meta-data
            android:name="com.hihonor.push.app_id"
            android:value="HONOR Push AppId"
    </application>

    <permission
        android:name="${applicationId}.hihonor.permission.PROCESS_PUSH_MSG"
        android:protectionLevel="signatureOrSystem" />

    <uses-permission android:name="com.hihonor.push.permission.READ_PUSH_NOTIFICATION_INFO" />

    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="com.hihonor.push.action.BIND_PUSH_SERVICE" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
```


### Step 3. Enable HONOR Push
Enable the third-party push API before calling TPNS' `XGPushManager.registerPush`:
```java
// Enable third-party push
XGPushConfig.enableOtherPush(getApplicationContext(), true);


// The log of successful registration is as follows:
I/TPush: [OtherPushClient] handleUpdateToken other push token is : IQAAAACy0Ps******GlJi_5-0rpskunnNMcat35HA  other push type: honor
I/TPush: [PushServiceBroadcastHandler] >> bind OtherPushToken success ack with [accId = 150000****  , rsp = 0]  token = 01a22******ed343 otherPushType = honor otherPushToken = IQAAAACy0Ps******GlJi_5-0rpskunnNMcat35HA 

```

### Step 4. Obfuscate the code
```xml
-ignorewarnings
-keepattributes *Annotation*
-keepattributes Exceptions
-keepattributes InnerClasses
-keepattributes Signature
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

-keep class com.hihonor.push.framework.aidl.**{*;}
-keep class com.hihonor.push.sdk.**{*;}
```

>? Obfuscation rules must be stored in the `proguard-rules.pro` file at the application project level.
>


## Troubleshooting

### Querying HONOR Push registration error code

If you observe logs similar to the following, it indicates that registration with the HONOR channel fails. In this case, you can use the method described below to get the HONOR Push registration error code.
```
[OtherPushClient] handleUpdateToken other push token is :  other push type: honor
```

In debugging mode of the push service, filter logs by the keyword `OtherPush` to view the return code logs. Then, locate the error cause and fix the error by referring to [Troubleshooting Vendor Channel Registration Failures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/37006).
