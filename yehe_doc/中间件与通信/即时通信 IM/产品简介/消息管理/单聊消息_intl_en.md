One-to-one messages are applicable to one-to-one chats on the app, which are similar to the QQ and WeChat chats between two friends.
- **App administrator sends messages**
One-to-one messages can be sent by the app administrator from the backend, or by the app administrator simulating other users.

The app administrator can send system messages from the backend. These system messages are notifications delivered to users, and custom messages from the app administrator received by the app will be specially handled.

Instant Messaging (IM) provides comprehensive one-to-one messaging capabilities. At the same time, the permission control and extension capabilities of one-to-one messaging provide features such as getting message history, multi-device synchronization, offline message push, and carrying sender profiles in messages.

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d28999fa32da4e5e6750f34117e116bb.png)

#### Offline cache and roaming of one-to-one messages:

1. User A calls `sendMessage` to send messages to user B who is offline.
   - User A is added to user Bâ€™s recent contacts, with up to 100 messages cached.
   - Messages are stored in the offline cache for 7 days.
   - Messages are stored on the roaming server for 7 days.
2. User B calls the `login` API to log in to IM.
3. The SDK automatically pulls messages from the offline cache and throws them through the `OnNewMessage` API.
4. The SDK automatically pulls recent contacts and throws them through the `OnNewMessage` API.
5. The user is notified through the `OnRefresh` API when message synchronization is completed.
6. The user calls `getMessage`. If local messages are incomplete, the SDK automatically pulls them from the roaming server.
