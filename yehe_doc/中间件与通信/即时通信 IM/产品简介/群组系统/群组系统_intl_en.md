## Group System Overview
The group system is an instant messaging system that allows multiple participants to communicate in one chat. The group system has the following basic capabilities:
- Comprehensive [group management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33530) capabilities: group creation and disbanding, member management, group profile management, member profile management, and more.
- Stable and reliable messaging and a sophisticated [group message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33526) management mechanism: permission control, muting/unmuting, message callback, message roaming, and more.
- Based on common use cases, Chat provides the following default group types: **work group (Work)**, **public group (Public)**, **meeting group (Meeting)**, **audio-video group (AVChatRoom)**, and **Community group (Community)**.
- Upper limit on the number of group members:
  - The number of members in a Work, Public, or Meeting group can be increased to a maximum of 6,000 if fees are paid. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
  - A community group (Community) supports up to 100,000 members per group.
  - There is no upper limit on the number of members in an audio-video group (AVChatRoom).


>!
>- Although audio-video groups (AVChatRoom) support unlimited group members, if a spike in group members is expected within a short time (in scenarios such as large online events where the number of members in a single group reaches 50,000 or above), [contact Tencent Cloud customer service](https://cloud.tencent.com/about/connect) or sales representatives in advance and report service resource usage by providing the SDKAppID and the scheduled event time.
>- Currently, historical message storage is available only for non-audio-video groups, with messages stored for 7 days for billing plans of the Free Edition and Pro Edition and 30 days for the Ultimate Edition by default. If you require a longer storage period, change the storage period of historical messages in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im). Increasing the storage period of historical messages is a value-added service. For more information on pricing, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
>- Community is a new powerful tool for entertainment collaboration. Within the same community, a high number of members can be divided into different groups and topics to separate messages for hierarchical communication, yet they can also share the same set of friend relationships. This helps you develop a unique path of social expansion. The community feature is suitable for diverse use cases, such as finding like-minded people, game-based social networking, fan marketing, and organization management.
>- The community feature is available in native SDK 5.8.1668 (enhanced) or later and web SDK 2.17.0 or later. To use it, [purchase the Ultimate edition](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/avc?from=17182), go to the [**console**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im/qun-setting), choose **Group feature configuration** > **Community**, and toggle on the community group feature.

Chat's group system is highly customizable, allowing you to use:

- [Custom message elements](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527)
- [Custom group IDs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-group-ids)
- [Custom topic IDs](#customize)
- [Custom fields](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-fields)
- [Webhooks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-callbacks)

## Group Member Roles

The following table lists various group member roles and their permissions:

| Group Member Role | Description       | Management Permission         |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Ordinary member     |  An ordinary member has no management permissions.      |   In a work group (Work), an ordinary member has the permission to modify the group profile.    |
| Admin       | An admin is appointed by the group owner to assist in managing group members and holds certain management permissions. |<ul style="margin:0;"><li>Modify the group profile</li><li>Remove an ordinary member from the group</li><li>Mute an ordinary member, that is, prevent the ordinary member from speaking for a certain period of time</li><li>Approve or reject a membership application</li></ul>Work groups do not support the setting of admins by default. |
| Group owner         | A group owner is the creator of a group and has the highest level of management permissions in the group.    | The group owner has the following permissions in addition to all permissions held by an admin: <ul style="margin:0;"><li>Appoint or cancel an admin</li><li>Remove an admin from the group</li><li>Mute an admin</li><li>Disband the group</li><li>Transfer the group</li></ul> |
| App admin | This special role has the authority to manage all group permissions in the app and has more power than the group owner. | The app admin has the same permissions as the group owner, whether it is a member of the group or not. |

[](id:GroupType)
## Group Types

Based on common use cases, Chat provides the following default group types:

| Group Type | Applicable Scenario |
|--------|---------|
| Work group (Work) | After a work group is created, users can join the group only after being invited by group members. The invitation does not need to be accepted by the invitee or approved by the group owner. This group type is the same as private group (Private) in earlier versions.  |
| Public group (Public) | After a public group is created, the group owner can designate group admins. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send a request, and the request needs to be approved by the group owner or an admin before the user can join the group. |
| Meeting group (Meeting) | A meeting group allows users to join and leave freely and view historical messages sent before they join the group. Meeting groups are ideal for scenarios that integrate Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC), such as audio/video conferencing and online education. This group type is the same as chat room (ChatRoom) in earlier versions. |
| Audio-video group (AVChatRoom) | An audio-video group allows users to join and exit freely, supports an unlimited number of members, and does not store message history. Audio-video groups can be used with Cloud Streaming Services (CSS) to support on-screen comment chat scenarios. |
| Community group (Community) | A community group allows users to join and exit freely, supports up to 100,000 members, and stores message history. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send an application, and the application does not need to be approved by an admin before the user can join the group. |


### Differences in basic group capabilities

| Item | Work Group | Public Group | Meeting Group | Audio-Video Group | Community Group |
|--- |-- |-- |-- |-- |-- |
| Available member roles | Group owner<br>Ordinary member<br>App admin | Group owner<br>Admin<br>Ordinary member<br>App admin | Group owner<br>Admin<br>Ordinary member<br>App admin | Group owner<br>App admin | Group owner<br>Admin<br>Ordinary member<br>App admin |

| Number of group members whose information can be obtained | All group members | All group members | All group members | None (no group member information stored) | All group members |
| Who can disband a group | App admin | Group owner and app admin | Group owner and app admin | Group owner and app admin | Group owner and app admin |

>?
>- Group types are upgraded in the new SDK version and they are **work group (Work)**, **public group (Public)**, **meeting group (Meeting)**, **audio-video group (AVChatRoom)**, and **Community group (Community)**. Private group (Private) and chat room (ChatRoom) in earlier versions (which have Public, Private, ChatRoom, and AVChatRoom groups) correspond to work group (Work) and meeting group (Meeting) in the new version respectively.
>- Ordinary members of a work group (Work) can modify only the group name, introduction, announcement, and group profile photo URL, but not other group profile information.
>- If the roles of a group type cannot meet your business needs, you can add roles by setting member-level [custom fields](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#custom-fields).
>- It is necessary to obtain the information about some members in scenarios where an audio-video group displays a list of some of its members.

### Differences in joining a group

>- Exact search is to search for a group by group ID. Fuzzy search is to search for a group by fields such as the group name.
>- Approval for joining a group: the group owner and admin can choose to approve or reject applications made by non-members to join the group. Only approved users can join the group.
>- For a group type that does not support the invitation of non-members to a group, group members can share the group ID with non-members in the app so that the non-members can join the group.

>- Currently, offline push is available only on Android (Android offline push) and iOS (APNs push) platforms.
>- The work group, public group, meeting group, and community group have the historical message storage capability, which allows historical messages to be stored for 7 days (30 days for the Ultimate Edition) free of charge by default. If you need a longer storage period, change the storage period of historical messages in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im). Increasing the storage period of historical messages is a value-added service. For more information on pricing, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).


### Differences in batch import and automatic repossession

| Item | Work Group/Public Group/Meeting Group/Community Group | Audio-Video Group |
|--- |--- |--- |
| Importing groups, group members, and group messages is allowed | Yes. It is allowed when historical groups are migrated from a third-party platform to Chat. | No. Only existing groups, group members, and group messages can be used. |
| Time before a group is automatically repossessed (in seconds) | The backend does not repossess groups, unless the group owner disbands the group or all members quit the group. (About group disbanding: the backend does not proactively disband a group unless the group owner disbands the group or the group is automatically repossessed. If automatic repossession is configured for a group, the backend irregularly traverses the group and disbands it if no one sends a message in the group for n seconds or the group profile is modified.) | The backend does not repossess groups, unless the group owner disbands the group or all members quit the group. |

>!To enable group repossession, submit a ticket based on [ticket templates](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/44322#.E8.87.AA.E5.8A.A8.E5.9B.9E.E6.94.B6.E7.BE.A4.E7.BB.84). After configuration, inactive groups will be removed. An inactive group is one in which no message has been sent and no member change has occurred.

## Group Data Structure
### Group basic information[](id:GroupBaseInfoFilter)

| Field Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| GroupId | String | Unique identifier of the group | Read-only.<br>Each group ID must be unique in the app. The prefix is @TGS#, and custom group IDs can also be used in the app. |
|Type | String | Group type | Read-only.<br>The following group types are supported by default: work group, public group, meeting group, audio-video group, and community group. For more information, see [Group Types](#GroupType).<br>In the SDK of an earlier version, group types also include the private group, ChatRoom, and BChatRoom, which are not recommended. |
| Name | String | Name of the group | Readable and writable. The maximum length is 30 bytes and cannot be adjusted. |
| Introduction | String | Introduction of the group | Readable and writable. The maximum length is 240 bytes and cannot be adjusted. |
| Notification | String | Group announcement | Readable and writable. The maximum length is 300 bytes and cannot be adjusted. |
| FaceUrl | String | URL of the group's profile photo | Readable and writable. The maximum length is 100 bytes and cannot be adjusted. |
| Owner_Account | String | ID of the group owner | Read-only. |

| LastMsgTime | Integer | Time of the last message in the group chat | Read-only. |
| NextMsgSeq | Integer | Sequence number of the next message in the group chat | Read-only.<br>Every message in the group chat has a unique sequence number. Sequence numbers are consecutive numbers based on the sequence of sent messages. With every message sent in the group chat, `NextMsgSeq` (starting from 1) increases by 1. (By default, `NextMsgSeq` also increases by 1 for every system message such as a group joining or leaving notification.) |
| MemberNum | Integer | Number of current members | Read-only. |
| MaxMemberNum | Integer | Maximum number of members | The default value is the upper limit of the paid package. For example, it is 20 for a Free Edition. If you upgrade your package, you need to modify this field according to the basic information of the modified group. |
| ApplyJoinOption | String | Membership application option | The following options are available:<ul style="margin:0;"><li>DisableApply: disallow any application.</li><li>NeedPermission: group owner or admin's approval is required.</li><li>FreeAccess: users can join the group freely without prior approval.</li></ul> |


>!The permissions to modify the group name, introduction, announcement, and profile photo URL are described as follows:
>- In a work group, any member can modify them.
>- For other group types, only **non-ordinary members** can modify them.

### Group member profile[](id:SelfInfoFilter)

| Field Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| Member_Account | String | Group member ID | Read-only. |
| Role | String | Role in the group | A group has the following roles: Owner (group owner), Admin (group admin), and Member (group member). |
| JoinTime | Integer | Time of joining the group | Read-only. |
| MsgSeq | Integer | Sequence number of the current read message of the member | Read-only. |
| MsgFlag | String | Message receiving option | The following options are available:<ul style="margin:0;"><li>AcceptAndNotify: receive and notify.</li><li>AcceptNotNotify: receive without notifying (remote APNs push is not triggered)</li><li>Discard: block group messages (messages are not pushed to clients)</li></ul>|
| LastSendMsgTime | Integer | Time of sending the last message | Supported by work groups, public groups, and meeting groups, but not audio-video groups. |
|NameCard|String|Group name card| Readable and writable. It can contain up to 50 bytes and cannot be adjusted. |
|MuteUntil  |Integer| Mute status | `0`: The member is not muted; other values: The time when the member will be unmuted. |

## Custom Group IDs

When a group is created in the app, Chat assigns a default group ID to the new group by default. This default group ID starts with @TGS# and is unique in the app.
Chat also allows you to customize group IDs that are simple and easy to remember and communicate. A custom group ID must be a string of ASCII characters (0x20-0x7e) with a length less than 48 bytes. Do not use @TGS# as the prefix to avoid confusion with assigned group IDs.
>!The prefix of the IDs of community groups (Community) must be @TGS#_.

[](id:customize)
## Custom Topic IDs

When a topic is created in the app, Chat assigns a default topic ID to the new topic by default. This default topic ID starts with `GroupId+@TOPIC#_` and is unique in the group.

To simplify the topic ID, Chat allows customizing it in the format of "GroupId+@TOPIC#_+Custom part" during topic creation through the RESTful API in the app. The custom part in a custom topic ID must exclude `@TGS#_` and `@TOPIC#_@TOPIC#` to avoid confusion with default group IDs assigned and must be printable ASCII characters (0x20-0x7e).

For example, if `GroupId` is `@TGS#_@TGS#cQVLVHIM62CJ`, and the custom part is `TestTopic`, the complete custom topic ID is `@TGS#_@TGS#cQVLVHIM62CJ@TOPIC#_TestTopic`. Note that the entire custom topic ID must be within 96 bytes.

## Custom Fields

Chat allows you to configure up to 10 group-level custom fields and 5 member-level custom fields based on your business needs. With custom fields, apps can attach additional data to groups, and the data can be read and written through existing APIs.

### Description

Custom fields have the following characteristics:

- Their values are expressed in key-value format.
- Key is a string with a length less than 16 bytes. Its name contains only uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores (_).
- Value is a buffer customized by the user, which can be binary data. Group-level values have a maximum length of 512 bytes, while member-level values have a maximum length of 64 bytes.
- You can configure the least read permission and the least write permission for each key.

The read and write permissions of a custom field are listed as follows, from high to low:

1. Readable and writable by the app admin.
2. Readable and writable by the group owner.
3. Readable and writable by the group admin.
4. Readable and writable by group members.
5. Readable and writable by anyone, including non-members.

For example, an app needs to extend the `GroupLevel` field for groups and the value of this field is a number representing the level of a group. If this level information is calculated by the app backend, then the least write permission should be **writable by the app admin**. If the field is part of the public profile of the group, its least read permission should be **readable by anyone, including non-members**.

If the value to be stored is a number, we recommend that C and C++ developers store it as a string instead of binary data. For example, when the number to be stored is 1, store it as string `1` instead of binary data `0x01`. In the future, Chat will offer more operations for custom fields, such as specific mathematical operations on values, which will be performed on the basis of string-type numbers.

### Configuration

Custom fields at these two levels can be configured in the Chat console.
To configure member-level custom fields, you need to specify the group type first. Audio-video group and custom group types that are configured based on it do not support custom fields at the group member level, because these types of groups do not store member profiles.
The **self read and write permissions** indicate whether members can read and write their own member-level custom fields. For example, a member-level customer field named `MemberLevel` represents the level of a member in a group. Group members can read but not modify their own levels, and therefore their **self read and write permissions** are set to **readable/unwritable** for this field.
>!Once custom fields are configured, they cannot be deleted or modified.

## Webhooks

Webhook is an important means to meet the special requirements of apps. It provides users with the capability to customize actions.
Chat's group system supports different webhooks. For more information, see [Webhook Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354) and [Webhook Command List](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34355).
