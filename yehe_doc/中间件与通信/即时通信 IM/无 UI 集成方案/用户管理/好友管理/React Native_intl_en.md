## Feature Description

The IM SDK supports friend management, and users can add and delete friends and set to send messages only to friends.

### Getting contacts

The IM SDK supports the logic for the friend relationship chain. You can call the `getFriendList` API ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/getFriendList.html)) to get contacts.

Sample code:

```javascript
// Get contacts
const friendsList = await friendshipManager.getFriendList();
```

### Adding a friend

Call the `addFriend` API ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/addFriend.html)) to add a friend.

Sample code:

```javascript
// Add a two-way friend
const userID = "userID";
const remark = "Friending remarks";
const addWording = "Remarks";
const addType = FriendTypeEnum.V2TIM_FRIEND_TYPE_BOTH;
const addFriend = await friendshipManager.addFriend(
  userID,
  remark,
  addWording,
  addType
);
```

The process has the following variations depending on whether friend verification is required.

#### Option 1. Friend request approval is not required

1. Users A and B call `setFriendListener` to set the relationship chain listener.

2. User B specifies that friend request approval is not required (`V2TIM_FRIEND_ALLOW_ANY`) through the `allowType` field ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Interface/User/V2TimUserFullInfo.html#allowtype)) in the `setSelfInfo` function.

3. User A can add user B as a friend successfully by calling `addFriend`, after which the `addType` of the `V2TIMFriendAddApplication` request parameter can be set to either value as needed:
   - If it is set to `V2TIM_FRIEND_TYPE_BOTH` (two-way friend), both users A and B will receive the `onFriendListAdded` callback ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Callback/OnFriendListAdded.html)).
   - If it is set to `V2TIM_FRIEND_TYPE_SINGLE` (one-way friend), only user A will receive the `onFriendListAdded` callback.

#### Option 2. Friend request approval is required

1. Users A and B call `setFriendListener` to set the relationship chain listener.

2. User B specifies that friend request approval is required (`V2TIM_FRIEND_NEED_CONFIRM`) through the `allowType` field in the `setSelfInfo` function.
3. User A calls `addFriend` to request to add user B as a friend. The `resultCode` parameter in the callback for successful API call returns `30539`, indicating that the request needs to be approved by user B. In addition, both users A and B will receive the `onFriendApplicationListAdded` callback ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Callback/OnFriendApplicationListAdded.html)).
4. User B will receive the `onFriendApplicationListAdded` callback. If `type` in the `V2TIMFriendApplication` parameter is `V2TIM_FRIEND_APPLICATION_COME_IN`, user B can accept or reject the request.
   - User B calls `acceptFriendApplication` ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/acceptFriendApplication.html)) to accept the friend request. If the type is `V2TIM_FRIEND_ACCEPT_AGREE` (one-way friend):
     - User A will receive the `onFriendListAdded` callback, indicating that the one-way friend was added successfully.
     - User B will receive the `onFriendApplicationListDeleted` callback ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Callback/OnFriendApplicationListDeleted.html)). At this point, user B has become a friend of user A, but not vice versa.
   - User B calls `acceptFriendApplication` to accept the friend request. If the type is `V2TIM_FRIEND_ACCEPT_AGREE_AND_ADD` (two-way friend), both users A and B will receive the `onFriendListAdded` callback, indicating that they added each other as a friend successfully.
   - User B calls `refuseFriendApplication` ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/refuseFriendApplication.html)) to reject the friend request, and both users will receive the `onFriendApplicationListDeleted` callback.

### Deleting a friend

Call the `deleteFromFriendList` API ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/deleteFromFriendList.html)) to delete a friend.

Sample code:

```javascript
// Delete a two-way friend
const userIDList = ["user1"];
const deleteType = FriendTypeEnum.V2TIM_FRIEND_TYPE_BOTH;
const deleteres = await friendshipManager.deleteFromFriendList(
  userIDList,
  deleteType
);
```

### Checking the friend relationship

Call the `checkFriend` API ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/RN/en/Api/V2TIMFriendshipManager/checkFriend.html)) to check the friend relationship.

Sample code:

```javascript
// Check whether the friend relationship is one-way or two-way
const checkType = FriendTypeEnum.V2TIM_FRIEND_TYPE_BOTH;
const userIDList = [];
const checkres = await friendshipManager.checkFriend(userIDList, checkType);
```

### Setting to send messages to friends only

By default, IM SDK does not check the relationship when sending one-to-one messages. This default setting is generally applied in customer service scenarios, where having to friend a customer service agent before chatting is inefficient.
To implement "adding a friend before sending a message" like WeChat or QQ, you can log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im), select **Feature Configuration** > **Login and Message** > **Relationship Check**, and enable **Check Relationship for One-to-One Messages**. After it is enabled, a user can send messages only to friends. If the user sends a message to a non-friend user, the SDK will report error code 20009.
