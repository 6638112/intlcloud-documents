## Feature Description
A user's conversation list usually contains multiple conversations. If there is a new message in one of the conversations, a badge needs to be displayed in the list cell to indicate the unread count.
After the user clicks to enter the conversation and goes back to the conversation list, the unread count is cleared, and the badge disappears.
In some applications, the total unread count of all the conversations is calculated and displayed at the bottom tab of the conversation list.

This document describes how to implement the conversation unread count notification feature.

## Getting the Total Unread Count of All the Conversations
In general cases, to get the total unread count of all the conversations, you can traverse the conversation list to get the `V2TimConversation` information of each conversation and add the `unreadCount` values of all the `V2TimConversation` objects to get the final result and display it on the UI.
The IM SDK provides the `getTotalUnreadMessageCount` API to query the total unread count of all the conversations.
When the total unread count changes, the SDK will notify you of the latest total unread count through the `onTotalUnreadMessageCountChanged` callback.

>? This feature is supported only by the SDK for Flutter on v3.0.0 or later.

Below are detailed steps.

### Getting the total unread count
Call `getTotalUnreadMessageCount` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_im_sdk_plugin_platform_interface/latest/im_flutter_plugin_platform_interface/ImFlutterPlatform/getTotalUnreadMessageCount.html)) to get the total unread count of all the conversations and update it on the UI.

Sample code:


```dart
// Get the total unread count
V2TimValueCallback<int> unread = await conversationManager.getTotalUnreadMessageCount();
```


### Notification of a change in the total unread count
Call `addConversationListener` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_im_sdk_plugin_platform_interface/latest/im_flutter_plugin_platform_interface/ImFlutterPlatform/addConversationListener.html)) to add a conversation listener to receive notifications of a change in the total unread count.

You can get the changed total unread count in `onTotalUnreadMessageCountChanged` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_im_sdk_plugin_platform_interface/latest/enum_callbacks/OnTotalUnreadMessageCountChanged.html)) of `V2TIMConversationListener`.

Sample code:


```dart
conversationManager.addConversationListener(listener: V2TimConversationListener(onTotalUnreadMessageCountChanged: (totalUnreadCount) {
    // Latest unread count
  },));
```


## Clearing the Conversation Unread Count
After the user clicks to enter a conversation and goes back to the conversation list, the unread count needs to be cleared, after which the badge in the conversation list needs to disappear.
The IM SDK provides three APIs to clear the unread count for different conversation types:
* `markC2CMessageAsRead` is used to clear the unread count of a **one-to-one** conversation.
* `markGroupMessageAsRead` is used to clear the unread count of a **group** conversation.
* `markAllMessageAsRead` is used to clear the unread count of **all** the conversations.

Below are detailed steps.

>? This feature is supported only by the SDK of the Enhanced edition on v5.8.1668 or later. 

### One-to-one chat
Call `markC2CMessageAsRead` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_im_sdk_plugin_platform_interface/latest/im_flutter_plugin_platform_interface/ImFlutterPlatform/markC2CMessageAsRead.html)) to clear the unread count of a specified one-to-one conversation.

Sample code:


```dart
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().markC2CMessageAsRead(userID: "userID");
```


After `markC2CMessageAsRead` is called successfully:
1. If the caller has called `addConversationListener` to add a conversation listener, it will receive the `onConversationChanged` callback and update the UI.
2. The sender will receive the `onRecvC2CReadReceipt` callback that contains the timestamp when the conversation unread count is cleared.

Sample code:


```dart
// Receiver 
conversationManager.addConversationListener(listener: V2TimConversationListener(,onConversationChanged: (conversationList) {
    // Latest conversation after the change
  },));

// Sender
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().addAdvancedMsgListener(listener: V2TimAdvancedMsgListener(onRecvC2CReadReceipt: (receiptList) {
    // The message is read by the receiver.
  },));
```


### Group chat
Call `markGroupMessageAsRead` ([Details](https://comm.qq.com/im/doc/flutter/en/SDKAPI/Api/V2TIMMessageManager/markGroupMessageAsRead.html)) to clear the unread count of a specified group conversation.

Sample code:


```dart
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().markGroupMessageAsRead(groupID: "groupID");
```


After `markGroupMessageAsRead` is called successfully, if the caller has called `addConversationListener` to add a conversation listener, it will receive the `onConversationChanged` callback and update the UI.

Sample code:


```dart
conversationManager.addConversationListener(listener: V2TimConversationListener(,onConversationChanged: (conversationList) {
    // Latest conversation after the change
  },));
```


### All conversations
Call `markAllMessageAsRead` ([Details](https://pub.dev/documentation/tencent_im_sdk_plugin_platform_interface/latest/im_flutter_plugin_platform_interface/ImFlutterPlatform/markAllMessageAsRead.html)) to clear the unread count of all the conversations.

Sample code:


```dart
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getMessageManager().markAllMessageAsRead();
```


After `markAllMessageAsRead` is called successfully, if the caller has called `addConversationListener` in advance to add a conversation listener, it will receive the `onConversationChanged` callback and update the UI.

Sample code:

```java
conversationManager.addConversationListener(listener: V2TimConversationListener(,onConversationChanged: (conversationList) {
    // Latest conversation after the change
  },));
```
