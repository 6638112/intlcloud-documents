## Conversation

When a user creates a one-to-one or group chat, a conversation will be created.
In the Tencent Cloud IM SDK, the conversation class is `TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.getConversationManager()`. You can use the conversation management class APIs to display/update the conversation list, update the unread count, pin a conversation to the top, make a conversation draft, and mute message notifications.

## Conversation Storage Policy

There is no limit on the number of locally stored conversations.
Up to 100 conversations can be stored in the cloud. To increase this limit, upgrade to the Ultimate edition. Then you can set the limit to 500 in the console.

If the information of a conversation has not been updated for a long time, the conversation can be stored in the cloud for up to seven days. To extend the conversation storage period, [contact us](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.

Locally stored conversations may not always be consistent with those stored in the cloud. If the user does not call the `deleteConversation` API to delete the local conversations, the conversations will always exist. However, up to 100 conversations can be stored in the cloud, and if the information of a conversation has not been updated for a long time, the conversation can be stored in the cloud for up to seven days. Therefore, local conversations displayed on different terminals may differ.
