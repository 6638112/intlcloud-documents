## Feature Description

If a user doesn't want to view the historical one-to-one or group messages after deleting a friend or leaving a group, the user can choose to delete the conversation. Multi-client sync is disabled for conversation deletion by default and can be enabled in the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im-detail/login-message).

## Deleting a Conversation

>!
>- Starting from v2.16.1, the historical messages will be deleted after a conversation is deleted.
>- On versions earlier than v2.16.1, the historical messages will not be deleted after a conversation is deleted. For example, if the conversation with user A is deleted, the historical messages are still retained when a new conversation with user A is started.
>- Multi-client sync is disabled for conversation deletion by default. To enable it, log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im-detail/login-message), select **Application Configuration** > **Feature Configuration** > **Login and Message** > **Multi-client Synchronization Settings**, and enable **Sync Conversation Deletion Across Clients**.
