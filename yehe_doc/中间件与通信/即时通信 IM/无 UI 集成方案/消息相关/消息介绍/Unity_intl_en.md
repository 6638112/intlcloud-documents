## Message Type

IM messages can be classified by message destination into two types: one-to-one messages (also called C2C messages) and group messages.

| Message Type       | API Keyword  | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| One-to-one message | C2CMessage   | It is also called the C2C message. When sending a one-to-one message, you must specify the `UserID` of the receiver, and only the receiver can receive this message. |
| Group message      | GroupMessage | When sending a group message, you must specify the `groupID` of the target group, and all users in the group can receive this message.                               |

IM messages can also be classified by content into text messages, image messages, video messages, audio messages, file messages, location messages, merged messages, and group tip messages.

## Message Storage Policy

IM messages can be classified by message storage policy into two types: online messages and non-online messages.
Online messages can be received only by online users and will not be pushed when they are offline. Non-online messages can be received by users whether they are online or not.

Online messages are delivered in real time and not stored on the server or in the SDK. Therefore, they cannot be pulled from historical messages after the device is changed or the application is uninstalled and reinstalled.

> 1. All messages in an audio-video group are online messages.
> 2. Messages pushed to all users are online messages.

Non-online messages are stored in the SDK and on the server. By default, they are stored on the roaming server for seven days. If you want a longer storage period, you need to purchase the value-added service. For more information on the service content and billing, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

These messages, for example, all types of ordinary messages, can be pulled from historical messages after the device is changed or the application is uninstalled and reinstalled.
