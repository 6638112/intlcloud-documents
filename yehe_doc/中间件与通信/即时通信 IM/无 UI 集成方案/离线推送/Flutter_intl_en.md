Tencent Cloud Chat terminal users need to obtain the latest messages at any time. However, considering the limited performance and battery capacity of mobile devices, we recommend that you use the system-grade push channels provided by vendors for message notifications when the app is running in the background to avoid excessive resource consumption caused by maintaining a persistent connection. Compared with third-party push channels, system-grade push channels provide more stable system-grade persistent connections, enabling users to receive push messages at any time and greatly reducing resource consumption.

>?
>
>- If you want app users to receive Chat message notifications when, without proactive logout, the app is switched to the background, the mobile phone screen is locked, or the app process is killed by a user, you can enable offline push of the Chat service.
>- If the `logout` API is called to log out proactively or you are forced to log out due to multi-device login, you cannot receive offline push messages even though offline push of the Chat service is enabled.

Chat for Flutter integrates a plugin to connect to the offline push of mainstream vendors such as Apple, Google, OPPO, vivo, Huawei, Mi, Meizu, and Honor.

This document describes how to connect to offline push of the Chat service. The plugin has been encapsulated with the SDKs of the vendors mentioned above, and you only need to reconstruct them a little before calling them.

>?
>
> - If vendor offline push has been configured for your application, you only need to enter the vendor information in the console as instructed in [step 1](#step_1) and [step 5](#step_5) and report the certificate ID after logging in to the application.
> - If you want to push messages of other types (such as operations messages) for your application, or an error occurs in the connection to a third-party push SDK, perform configuration by referring to [Pushing Other Business Messages](#push_to_all). **We do not recommend that you use the SDK with other third-party push SDKs, such as Tencent Push Notification Service (TPNS).**
> - If offline push is not required by your application or is not supported in your business scenarios, see [Online Push - Creating a Local Message Notification](#online_push).

## Plugin APIs

>? The following APIs are compatible with Android/iOS platforms and supported vendor devices unless otherwise specified. The platform and vendor are identified inside the plugin, which can be called directly.

## Using the Plugin to Run the Offline Push (Overview + Android)

Install the offline push plugin of Chat for Flutter in your project.

Tencent Cloud provides two message push plugin editions: the Chinese mainland edition and the international edition. Use Apple Push Notification service (APNs) for iOS devices. However, the channels for Android devices vary with the vendors.

| Edition | Package | Support for Google FCM | Native Channel Support for Chinese Device Vendors | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Chinese mainland edition | [tencent_chat_push_for_china](https://pub.dev/packages/tencent_chat_push_for_china) | No | Yes | Offline push for Android devices is implemented only through the native channels of the vendors. |
| International edition | [tim_ui_kit_push_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/tim_ui_kit_push_plugin) | Yes | Yes | The Google FCM channel is preferred whenever possible. Native channels of the vendors are also supported. |

Choose the suitable push plugin based on your target customers.

```shell
// Chinese mainland edition
flutter pub add tencent_chat_push_for_china

// International edition
flutter pub add tim_ui_kit_push_plugin
```

Find the push plugin that you want in the plugin marketplace, and install and enable the plugin. For more information, [click here](https://intl.cloudwww.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/4856852589).

>? If you have any doubt when you perform the following steps, see the [demo source code](https://github.com/TencentCloud/TIMSDK/tree/master/Flutter/Demo/im-flutter-uikit). Pay attention to the files in the `lib/utils/push` folder and the call methods.

### Step 1. Aggregate the class of constants[](id:step_1)

1. After configuring the [connection preparations (vendor registration)](#firstone), go to the Chat console, and click **Basic Configuration** to view the certificate ID allocated for your vendor channel application on the backend on the right.
2. Instantiate the information and vendor channel account information into a static `PushAppInfo` class, which needs to be passed in later.
3. You can configure the information of all the vendor push models that need to be connected in the class. You don't need to enter a complete constructor field. If you want to use a vendor platform, you need to enter the relevant field of the platform.

 ```Dart
static final PushAppInfo appInfo = PushAppInfo(
  hw_buz_id: , // Huawei certificate ID
  mi_app_id: , // Mi `APPID`
  mi_app_key: , // Mi `APPKey`
  mi_buz_id: , // Mi certificate ID
  mz_app_id: , // Meizu `APPID`
  mz_app_key: , // Meizu `APPKey`
  mz_buz_id: , // Meizu certificate ID
  vivo_buz_id: , // vivo certificate ID
  oppo_app_key: , // OPPO `APPKey`
  oppo_app_secret: , // OPPO `APP Secret`
  oppo_buz_id: , // OPPO certificate ID
  oppo_app_id: , // OPPO `APPID`
  google_buz_id: , // Google FCM certificate ID
  apple_buz_id: , // Apple certificate ID
  honor_buz_id: , // Honor certificate ID
);
 ```

>?For more information, see the [`lib/utils/push/push_constant.dart`](https://github.com/TencentCloud/chat-demo-flutter/blob/main/lib/utils/push/push_constant.dart) file in the demo.

### Step 2. Add vendor project configuration to the code[](id:step_2)

#### Google FCM

>? If your application is not oriented for markets outside Chinese Mainland, you do not need to perform the following operations on Google FCM. If your application is intended for markets outside Chinese Mainland, ensure that you use the international edition of the push plugin [tim_ui_kit_push_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/tim_ui_kit_push_plugin).

##### Support for Android emulator debugging

To use Firebase Emulator Suite, open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the `usesCleartextTraffic` field to `application`.

```xml
<application
    android:usesCleartextTraffic="true" // Add this line
>
  <!-- possibly other elements -->
</application>
```

##### Integrating Google Firebase for Flutter capabilities

1. Open the `pubspec.yaml` file, add the `firebase_core` dependency, and use v1.12.0.
>?As the latest version of the Google Firebase for Flutter plugin is supported only by Dart v2.16.0 or later, you need to use v1.12.0 released in March 2022.
>
```yaml
dependencies:
  firebase_core: 1.12.0
```
2. Run `flutter pub get` to complete installation.
3. Run the following command in the console to configure the Google Firebase for Flutter project as prompted.
For more information, see [FlutterFire Overview](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview).
```shell
// Install the Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash

dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli

// Generate a configuration file
flutterfire configure
```
4. The project will be associated with that created in Google Firebase:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/21aa8a7fc710746e7fafd28178f1e047.png)
Initialize the FirebaseAPP in the `main()` method.

```Dart
WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

await Firebase.initializeApp(
  options: DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform,
);
```

#### Huawei

1. Open the `android/build.gradle` file.
2. Add the Huawei repository address and HMS Gradle plugin dependencies under **repositories and dependencies** in **buildscript**, respectively:

    }

    // Set release signing and passwords in the same build configuration file
    signingConfigs {
       release {
           storeFile file('<keystore_file>')
           storePassword '<keystore_password>'
           keyAlias '<key_alias>'
           keyPassword '<key_password>'
       }
   }
   buildTypes {
       // The debug mode also requires compilation with a certificate; otherwise, Huawei fingerprint verification may fail.
       debug {
           signingConfig signingConfigs.release
       }
       release {
           signingConfig signingConfigs.release
       }
    }
}
```
3. Open the `android/build.gradle` file, and add the Huawei dependency repository address under **repositories** in **allprojects**:

Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and configure `AppID` and `AppKey` of vivo as follows:

```
      android: {
        defaultConfig {
          manifestPlaceholders = [
            ....
            vivo_APPID: "Enter the vivo AppID that you obtained"
            vivo_APPKEY: "Enter the vivo AppKey that you obtained"
            .....
          ]
        }
      }
```

Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add `meta-data` to `<application>` as follows:

```xml
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.vivo.push.api_key"
        android:value="Enter the vivo AppKey that you obtained" />
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.vivo.push.app_id"
        android:value="Enter the vivo AppID that you obtained" />
</application>
```

##### vivo badge permission

    <meta-data
        android:name="com.hihonor.push.app_id"
        android:value="Enter the HONOR AppID that you obtained" />
</application>
```

Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following code:

```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://developer.hihonor.com/repo/' }  // Add
}
```

##### Push badge permission

Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following `uses-permission` information:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name = "com.hihonor.android.launcher.permission.CHANGE_BADGE" />
```

#### Mi/OPPO/Meizu

1. Open the `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the package name to `defaultConfig`.
```

defaultConfig {
    applicationId "${Enter your package name}"
    ...
}

```
2. Open the `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file and configure permissions for each vendor.
```xml
    <!--Mi Start-->
    <permission
        android:name="${Enter your package name}.permission.MIPUSH_RECEIVE"
        android:protectionLevel="signature" />
    <uses-permission android:name="${Enter your package name}.permission.MIPUSH_RECEIVE" />
    <!--Mi End-->

    <!--OPPO Start-->
    <uses-permission android:name="com.coloros.mcs.permission.RECIEVE_MCS_MESSAGE" />
    <uses-permission android:name="com.heytap.mcs.permission.RECIEVE_MCS_MESSAGE" />
    <!--OPPO End-->

    <!--Meizu Start-->
    <!-- It is optional and used for compatibility with Flyme OS 5 and push services on earlier versions.-->
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
    <!-- Permission configuration for compatibility with Flyme OS 5-->
    <uses-permission android:name="com.meizu.flyme.push.permission.RECEIVE" />
    <permission android:name="${Enter your package name}.push.permission.MESSAGE"
        android:protectionLevel="signature"/>
    <uses-permission android:name="${Enter your package name}.push.permission.MESSAGE" />
    <!-- Permission configuration for compatibility with Flyme OS 3-->
    <uses-permission android:name="com.meizu.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />
    <permission android:name="${Enter your package name}.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" android:protectionLevel="signature"
        />
    <uses-permission android:name="${Enter your package name}.permission.C2D_MESSAGE"/>
    <!--Meizu End-->
```

### Step 3. Initialize the push plugin after the Chat SDK initialization succeeds

1. Call the `init` method of the plugin to initialize the vendor channels and request the notification permissions from the vendors. 
2. Make sure that the Chat SDK is initialized before you initialize the push plugin.
```Dart
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
  isUseGoogleFCM: bool, // Whether to enable Google FCM. The default value is `true`. This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
);
await cPush.init(
    pushClickAction: pushClickAction, // Callback for the event upon notification click, which is as detailed in step 6.
    appInfo: PushConfig.appInfo, // Pass in the `appInfo` in step 1
);
```
3. After the initialization, you need to call the `createNotificationChannel` method to create message channels for some vendors, such as OPPO and Mi.
>?If the channel IDs obtained from the vendor are the same, it is okay to call the channel ID only once.
>
```Dart
cPush.createNotificationChannel(
  channelId: "new_message",
  channelName: "message push",
  channelDescription: "push new messages");
```
4. The push permission is not provided by some vendors (such as OPPO) by default and needs to be applied for by calling the `requireNotificationPermission` method.
>?You can apply for the permission when appropriate, such as, after the user logs in.
>
```Dart
cPush.requireNotificationPermission();
```

### Step 4. Report the token and certificate ID[](id:step_4)

The vendor certificate ID and device token need to be reported to the Chat console before vendor channels can be used by the server to issue notifications.

The plugin automatically locates the certificate ID of the current vendor in `appInfo` and reports the token.

>?
>
>- According to the privacy requirements of personal information protection laws, you can all this method to report the token only after user login and successful initialization of the push plugin.
>- We recommend that you report the token 5 seconds later after the successful initialization of the push plugin to prevent token generation delays caused by network jitters.

``` Dart
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
    isUseGoogleFCM: true, // This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
  );

Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 5), () async {
  final bool isUploadSuccess =
    await ChannelPush.uploadToken(PushConfig.appInfo);
  print("Push token upload result: $isUploadSuccess");
});
```

### Step 5. Listen for the foreground/background switch[](id:step_5)

The current status of the application needs to be reported to the Chat backend through the Chat SDK upon each foreground/background switch.

If the application is in the foreground, the notification push will not be triggered when a new message is received; otherwise, it will be triggered.

For more information, see [How do I listen to Android activity lifecycle events](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/flutter-for/android-devs#how-do-i-listen-to-android-activity-lifecycle-events).

We recommend you use the `setBadgeNum(int badgeNum )` method in the plugin before the application switches to the inactive/paused state, so as to update the latest unread count to the desktop badge. The plugin supports configuring badges for Mi (MIUI 6 to MIUI 11), Huawei, HONOR, vivo, and OPPO devices.

>?The OPPO badge is an advanced feature offered by OPPO and not available by default. To use it, contact the OPPO contact for application push.

  ```Dart
  /// App
  @override
  void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) async {
    print("--" + state.toString());
    int? unreadCount = await _getTotalUnreadCount();
    switch (state) {
      case AppLifecycleState.inactive:
       TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
          .getOfflinePushManager()
          .doBackground(unreadCount: unreadCount ?? 0);
        if(unreadCount != null){
          cPush.setBadgeNum(unreadCount);
        }
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.resumed:
        TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
          .getOfflinePushManager()
          .doForeground();
        break;
      case AppLifecycleState.paused:
        TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
          .getOfflinePushManager()
          .doBackground(unreadCount: unreadCount ?? 0);
        if(unreadCount != null){
          cPush.setBadgeNum(unreadCount);
        }
        break;
    }
  }
  ```

### Step 6. Configure offline push upon message sending and redirect upon notification click[](id:step_6)

#### Sending messages

##### Sending a message through the SDK

If you connect to the Chat SDK on your own, configure the `OfflinePushInfo offlinePushInfo` field when sending a message.

```Dart
OfflinePushInfo({
    this.title = '', // Push notification title. When this string is left empty, the Chat backend will automatically replace it with the sender nickname or, if the sender nickname is unavailable, the sender ID. Therefore, we recommend you leave it empty unless you have special needs, which delivers the same experience as Weixin.
    this.desc = '', // Push the second line
    this.disablePush = false,
    this.ext = '', // Extra information in the push, which can be obtained after the redirect upon notification click. We recommend you pass in the JSON string containing conversation information, so that the receiver can be redirected to the corresponding chat. For more information, see the following TUIKit instance code.
    this.androidOPPOChannelID = '', // OPPO channel ID
  });
```

##### Connecting to TUIKit

If you use TUIKit for Flutter, you can define the custom push by using `notificationTitle`/`notificationOPPOChannelID`/`notificationBody`/`notificationExt`/`notificationIOSSound` in `TIMUIKitChatConfig` of the `TIMUIKitChat` component as follows:

```Dart
TIMUIKitChat(
    config: TIMUIKitChatConfig(
            notificationTitle: "",// Push notification title. When this string is left empty, the Chat backend will automatically replace it with the sender nickname or, if the sender nickname is unavailable, the sender ID. Therefore, we recommend you leave it empty unless you have special needs.
            notificationOPPOChannelID: "", // OPPO channel ID configured for message push
            notificationBody: (V2TimMessage message, String convID, ConvType convType) {
              return "the second line of the push you customize based on the given parameters";
            },
            notificationExt: (V2TimMessage message, String convID, ConvType convType) {
              // The `ext` field you customize based on the given parameters. We recommend you pass in the conversation ID in JSON format as follows:
              String createJSON(String convID){
                return "{\"conversationID\": \"$convID\"}";
              }
              String ext =  (convType == ConvType.c2c
                  ? createJSON("c2c_${message.sender}")
                  : createJSON("group_$convID"));
              return ext;
            }
        )
)
```

#### Processing the click callback

1. Enter the callback method configured for `pushClickAction` in [step 3](#step_3).
2. During initialization, register the callback method to get the `Map` containing the push body and `ext` information.
3. If the JSON string containing `conversationID` is passed in for `ext` when `OfflinePushInfo` is created in the previous step, the receiver will be directly redirected to the corresponding chat.

>?If the receiver is redirected when the application is in the background, the Flutter homepage may have been unmounted and cannot provide a context for the redirect. Therefore, we recommend you cache a context upon start to ensure the success of the redirect.
>
>?We recommend you call the `clearAllNotification()` method to clear other notifications in the application on the notification bar after the redirect, to avoid too many Chat messages.
>
```Dart
BuildContext? _cachedContext;
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
  isUseGoogleFCM: true, // This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
);

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _cachedContext = context;
}

void handleClickNotification(Map<String, dynamic> msg) async {
    String ext = msg['ext'] ?? "";
    Map<String, dynamic> extMsp = jsonDecode(ext);
    String convId = extMsp["conversationID"] ?? "";

    // We recommend you determine whether the current page is the conversation to be redirected to.
    // If yes, we recommend you stop the redirect to avoid entering the same page.

    final targetConversationRes = await TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
        .getConversationManager()
        .getConversation(conversationID: convId);

    V2TimConversation? targetConversation = targetConversationRes.data;

    if(targetConversation != null){
      cPush.clearAllNotification();
      Navigator.push(
          _cachedContext ?? context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => Chat(
              selectedConversation: targetConversation,
            ),
          ));
    }
  }
```

### Step 7. Use TRTC to make one-to-one audio/video calls and send offline push[](id:step_7)

In general, you can start a TRTC call and use a signaling message to notify the receiver. In the signaling message, you can add the `offlinePushInfo` field as instructed in [step 6](#step_6).

#### Connecting to the Flutter call plugin

1. If you use the [tim_ui_kit_calling_plugin](https://pub.dev/packages/tim_ui_kit_calling_plugin) plugin, you need to upgrade it to v0.2.0 or later to use the offline push capability.
2. Pass in the `offlinePush` object in the third parameter of the `call` method as follows:

```Dart
final user = await sdkInstance.getLoginUser();
final myId = user.data;
OfflinePushInfo offlinePush = OfflinePushInfo(
  title: "",
  desc: "make an audio call to you",
  ext: "{\"conversationID\": \"c2c_$myId\"}",
  disablePush: false,
  ignoreIOSBadge: false,
  androidOPPOChannelID: PushConfig.OPPOChannelID
);

_calling?.call(widget.selectedConversation.userID!, CallingScenes.Audio, offlinePush);
```

>? Offline push is not supported for group call invitations.

## Using the Plugin to Run the Offline Push (iOS)

This section describes the steps required by iOS different from those required by Android to use the plugin to run the offline push.

Steps not mentioned here are the same as those for Android.

### Step 1. Add the iOS project configuration to the code

1. Use Xcode to open your project and configure the **Signing Profile** that supports **Push** in **Runner**>**Target**.
2. Add the `Push Notification` capability in the top-left corner.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/e1be71c63e505281aed6c7eb61c587ac.png)
3. Run `flutter pub get` to install the plugin, enter the iOS directory, and run `pod install` to install the dependency library.
4. Add the following code to the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method in the `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` file of the iOS project. For more information, see [DEMO](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tc-chat-demo-flutter/blob/main/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift).
Objective-C:
```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```
Swift:
```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```
5. If you don't use the Firebase Emulator Suite, you need to add the following field to `info.plist`.
```xml
<key>flutter_apns.disable_firebase_core</key>
<false/>
```

### Step 2. Perform initialization upon application start

Call the `init` method of the plugin to initialize vendor channels and request the vendor notification permission. We recommend you call the method upon application start.

```Dart
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
  isUseGoogleFCM: true, // This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
);
cPush.init(
    pushClickAction: pushClickAction, // Callback for the event upon notification click, which is as detailed in step 6.
    appInfo: PushConfig.appInfo, // Pass in the `appInfo` in step 1
);
```

### Step 3. Configure offline push upon message sending and redirect upon notification click

#### Sending messages

##### Sending a message through the SDK

  If you connect to the Chat SDK on your own, configure the `OfflinePushInfo offlinePushInfo` field when sending a message.

```Dart
OfflinePushInfo({
    // Other configurations
    this.iOSSound = "", // iOS offline push sound settings. `iOSSound = kIOSOfflinePushNoSound` indicates not to play back the system sound when a message is received; `iOSSound = kIOSOfflinePushDefaultSound` indicates to play back the system sound when a message is received. To customize `iOSSound`, you need to link the audio file to the Xcode project and pass in the filename (with the extension) to `iOSSound`.
    this.ignoreIOSBadge = false,
  });
```

##### Connecting to TUIKit

If you use TUIKit for Flutter, you can define the custom push by using `notificationTitle`/`notificationOPPOChannelID`/`notificationBody`/`notificationExt`/`notificationIOSSound` in `TIMUIKitChatConfig` of the `TIMUIKitChat` component as follows:

```Dart
TIMUIKitChat(
    config: TIMUIKitChatConfig(
            // Other configurations
            notificationIOSSound: "", // iOS offline push sound settings. `iOSSound = kIOSOfflinePushNoSound` indicates not to play back the system sound when a message is received; `iOSSound = kIOSOfflinePushDefaultSound` indicates to play back the system sound when a message is received. To customize `iOSSound`, you need to link the audio file to the Xcode project and pass in the filename (with the extension) to `iOSSound`.
        )
)
```

[](id:iosbadge)

### Step 5. Listen for the foreground/background switch

This step is similar to Step 5 for Android projects, and details are not described here again.

The Chat SDK for iOS already has the icon badge setting capability. Therefore, to avoid conflicts when you customize the badge, you need to disable the automatic badge setting feature of the Chat SDK and then call the `setBadgeNum` method. Sample code:

```dart
TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager.callExperimentalAPI(
    api: 'disableBadgeNumber',
    param: true
);
```

After the program starts, execute the code once only.

## Pushing Other Business Messages[](id:push_to_all)

To push other messages, such as operations messages and order messages, you can enable the push capability of the Chat server.

> ? The use of other push SDKs, such as Tencent Push Notification Service, in your project will result in the conflict between underlying SDKs of different vendors. In this case, the compilation fails. Therefore, we recommend that you install only the Chat for Flutter offline push plugin and use the push capability of the Chat server to deliver Chat messages and other push messages.

### Push APIs

1. Push to all users: You can call the pushing to all users API of the Chat service on the server to push messages to all users. For more information, [click here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/37165). This method also supports refined push by tags or attributes.
2. Push to specific users (**This feature is available on all editions**): You can call the corresponding API of the Chat service on the server to send one-to-one chat messages to a specified list of users in batches, with a maximum of 500 users in each batch. For more information, [click here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920).

### Push method

**Pushing messages by using the push capability of the Chat server is equivalent to sending a message to users by using an admin account. If the message content does not matter and you do not want to show the message to the users, you can filter out conversations with this admin account during rendering of the conversation list, and use only the push and redirect capabilities of the account.**

We recommend that, regardless of the method you use to send messages, you set `From_Account` to an independent admin account and pass through [the offline push information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527) so that you can trigger message push on clients.

The `ext` field of `OfflinePushInfo` is the same as that in [Step 6](#step_6). We recommend that you set this field to content in the JSON format that can be directed to after you tap the notification and that can be parsed on clients.

For more information about the `OfflinePushInfo` field, [click here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33527).

Below is a sample JSON package body for the pushing to all users API.

```json
{
    "From_Account": "Admin", // We recommend that you set the value to an admin account.
    "MsgRandom": 3674128,
    "MsgLifeTime": 120,
    "MsgBody": [
        {
            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",
            "MsgContent": {
                "Text": "Push Test"
            }
        }
    ],
    "OfflinePushInfo": {
        "PushFlag": 0,
    "Title": "Title of the message to push",
        "Desc": "Content to push offline",
        "Ext": "The content to be passed through. The value must be in the JSON format. You can get the content through click callback or custom operations such as tap-to-redirect.",
        "AndroidInfo": { // Push configuration on Android devices.
            "Sound": "android.mp3"
        },
        "ApnsInfo": { // Push configuration on iOS devices.
            "Sound": "apns.mp3",
            "BadgeMode": 1, // If this field is left as default or is set to `0`, the message is counted. If this field is set to `1`, the message is not counted, that is, the badge counter in the upper-right corner does not increase.
            "Title":"apns title", // APNs title
            "SubTitle":"apns subtitle", // APNs subtitle
            "Image":"www.image.com" // Image URL
        }
    }
}
```

## Debugging

### Offline push check

You can use the [Push Message Tool](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im-detail/tool-push-check) to detect the terminal status/certificate reporting and send test messages.

### Debugging on vivo[](id:vivotest)

vivo requires that an application not have the permission to use its push capabilities before launch on vivo APP STORE. For more information, see [here](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/151).
During development, you need to perform debugging in the following steps:

1. Get the `regId` (or device token) of the test device (vivo phone).
2. Add the device as the test device in the vivo console.
3. Push test messages to the device as instructed [here](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/363#w2-98542835).
4. As you cannot change the push mode to the test mode for the test push in the Chat console or the message push through the Chat SDK, you need to use our JavaScript script that can trigger test messages, which can be downloaded [here](https://tuikit-1251787278.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/testvivo.js).
5. After the download, enter the vivo parameters based on the five comment rows at the top. By default, `ext` is `conversationID`. If you need other fields when processing the callback for notification click (see [step 6](#step_6)), you can modify the JavaScript code.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/3f564ffd8f34feda3c87f065b9d2dfa0.png)
6. Run `npm install axios`, `npm install js-md5`, and then `node testvivo`, and the push result will be displayed in the last row of the log.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/27913289ee4d2e14f697923176775cc0.png)
7. At this point, the test terminal can receive the test message push. After the message is clicked, the callback at the Dart layer will be triggered.

## Vendor's Push Restrictions

1. All vendors in China have adopted message classification mechanisms, and different push policies are assigned for different types of messages. To make the push timely and reliable, you need to set the push message type of your app as the system message or important message with a high priority based on the vendor's rules. Otherwise, offline push messages are affected by the vendor's push message classification and may vary from your expectations.
2. In addition, some vendors set limits on the daily volumes of app push messages. You can check such limits in the vendor's console.
If offline push messages are not pushed timely or cannot be received, consider the following:
 - Huawei: Push messages are classified into service & communication messages and news & marketing messages with different push effects and policies. In addition, message classification is associated with the self-help message classification permission.
    - If there is no self-help message classification permission, the vendor will perform secondary intelligent message classification on push messages.
    - If you have applied for the self-help message classification permission, push messages will be classified based on the custom classification and then pushed.
    For more information, see [Message Classification Criteria](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/message-classification-0000001149358835).
 - vivo: Push messages are classified into system messages and operational messages with different push effects and policies. The system messages are further subject to the vendor's intelligent classification for correction. A message that cannot be intelligently identified as a system message will be automatically corrected as an operational message. If the judgment is incorrect, you can give a feedback by email. In addition, the total number of push messages is subject to a daily limit determined based on the app subscription statistics by the vendor. 
See [vendor description 1](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/359) or [vendor description 2](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/156) for details.
 - OPPO: Push messages are classified into private messages and public messages with different push effects and policies. Private messages are those that a user pays certain attention to and wants to receive in time. The private message channel permission needs to be applied for via email. The public message channel is subject to a number limit.
See [vendor description 1](https://open.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc#id=11227) or [vendor description 2](https://open.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc#id=11210) for details.
 - Mi: Push messages are classified into important messages and general messages with different push effects and policies. In particular, only instant messages, reminders of attracted events, agenda reminders, order status change, financial reminders, personal status change, resource changes, and device reminders fall into the important message category. The important message channel can be applied for in the vendor's console. General push messages are subject to a number limit.
See [vendor description 1](https://dev.mi.com/console/doc/detail?pId=2422) or [vendor description 2](https://dev.mi.com/console/doc/detail?pId=2086) for details.
 - Meizu: Push messages are subject to a number limit. For details, see [here](http://open.res.flyme.cn/fileserver/upload/file/202201/85079f02ac0841da859c1da0ef351970.pdf).
 - FCM: Upstream message push is subject to a frequency limit.
See [vendor description](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options?hl=en#upstream_throttling) for details.

## How do I troubleshoot if I cannot receive offline push messages?

### 1. OPPO devices

This generally occurs for the following reasons:

- According to requirements on the official website of OPPO Push, ChannelID must be configured on OPPO mobile phones that run Android 8.0 or later. Otherwise, push messages cannot be displayed. For the configuration method, see [OPPO Push configuration](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047#oppo-.E6.8E.A8.E9.80.81)
- The [custom content in the message for pass-through offline push](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047#.E9.80.8F.E4.BC.A0.E8.87.AA.E5.AE.9A.E4.B9.89.E5.86.85.E5.AE.B93) is not in the JSON format. As a result, OPPO mobile phones do not receive push messages.
- The notification bar display feature is disabled by default for applications installed on the OPPO device. If this is the case, check the switch status.

### 2. Sending custom messages

Custom messages are pushed offline differently from ordinary messages. Custom message content cannot be parsed, so the push content cannot be determined. Therefore, custom messages are not pushed by default. If you want to push them, you need to set the `desc` field of `offlinePushInfo` when calling `sendMessage`, after which `desc` will be displayed by default during the push.

### 3. Notification bar settings of the device

The offline push message can be intuitively displayed in the notification bar, so, just as other notifications, it is subject to the notification settings of the device. Take a Huawei device as an example.

- "Settings - Notifications - Notifications (Lock Screen) - Hide or Do not Disturb" will affect the display of offline push notifications when the screen is locked.
- "Settings - Notifications - Advanced Settings - Show Notification Icons (Status Bar)" will affect the showing of the offline push notification icon in the status bar.
- "Settings - Notifications - Application Notifications - Allow Notifications" will directly affect the display of offline push notifications.
- "Settings - Notifications - Application Notifications - Notification Sound" and "Settings - Notifications - Application Notifications - Notification Mute" will affect the offline push notification sound.

### 4. The failure still exists after integration as instructed

- First, test whether messages can be properly pushed offline by using the [offline test tool](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im-detail/tool-push-check) in the Chat console.
If offline push does not work properly, and the device status is exceptional, check the parameters in the Chat console and then check the code initialization and registration logic, including the vendor push service registration and Chat offline push configuration.
If offline push does not work properly but the device status is normal, check whether the ChannelID is correct or whether the backend service is working properly.
- The offline push relies on vendor capabilities, and some simple characters may be filtered out and cannot be pushed. For example, OPPO requires that the `ext` field be in JSON format.
- If offline push messages are not pushed timely or cannot be received, you need to check the vendor's push restrictions.

## Online Push - Creating a Local Message Notification[](id:online_push)

The section above describes how to use the plugin and the Chat backend push capabilities to implement offline push through vendor channels.

However, vendor offline push doesn't apply in some cases, for example, when a Huaqiangbei-customized Android device, rather than a compatible model, is used.

In this case, you can only listen for the message receiving callback online and manually trigger the notification creation on the client. This method applies only when your application is not killed but is in the foreground or background and can communicate with the Chat server.

In view of this, the plugin v0.3 offers two new methods to create a local message, that is, `displayNotification` for notification customization and `displayDefaultNotificationForMessage` for default notification generation based on the message. You can select one as needed.

### Preparing for integration

Install the Chat for Flutter push plugin in your project:

```shell
// Chinese mainland edition
flutter pub add tencent_chat_push_for_china

// International edition
flutter pub add tim_ui_kit_push_plugin
```

Find the push plugin that you want in the plugin marketplace, and install and enable the plugin. For more information, see [here](https://intl.cloudwww.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/4856852589).

#### Android

Make sure that `@mipmap/ic_launcher` exists as your application icon. The complete path is `android/app/src/main/res/mipmap/ic_launcher.png`.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/c3a5b95e6ffc519890122b7d474101a0.png)

If it doesn't exist, you can manually copy your application icon, or create a version of a different resolution through Android Studio by right-clicking the `mipmap` directory and choosing **New** > **Image Asset**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9641cb0de6a2172f57064d08f32a5a68.png)


#### iOS

If you have configured iOS offline push, you can skip this section. Otherwise, you need to add the following code to `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` in the `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` or  `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.m` file. For more information, see [DEMO](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tc-chat-demo-flutter/blob/main/ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift).

Objective-C:

```objc
if (@available(iOS 10.0, *)) {
  [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter].delegate = (id<UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate>) self;
}
```

Swift:

```swift
if #available(iOS 10.0, *) {
  UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self as? UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate
}
```

### Initializing the plugin

After initializing the Chat SDK, initialize the push plugin and instantiate a `cPush` plugin for subsequent calls.

```dart
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
  isUseGoogleFCM: true, // This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
);

cPush.init(
  // Bind the function for the redirect upon notification click, which is as detailed below
  pushClickAction: onClickNotification,
);
```

### Listening for the notification triggered by the new message callback

#### Listening for `V2TimAdvancedMsgListener`

If you have mounted `V2TimAdvancedMsgListener`, skip this section; otherwise, mount the listener after you log in to the Chat service.

Below is the code:

```dart
final advancedMsgListener = V2TimAdvancedMsgListener(
  onRecvNewMessage: (V2TimMessage newMsg) {
    // Listen for the event triggered by the callback
    // Call the API for triggering local message notification mentioned in the next step
  },
});

TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
        .getMessageManager()
        .addAdvancedMsgListener(listener: advancedMsgListener);
```

#### Triggering local message notification

Select the `displayNotification` API for notification customization or `displayDefaultNotificationForMessage` API for default notification generation based on messages, as needed.

For Android, you need to pass in `channelID` and `channelName` for both of the APIs. If no [Android push channels](https://developer.android.com/training/notify-user/channels) are created, you need to create one by using the `createNotificationChannel` API of the plugin.

```dart
cPush.createNotificationChannel(
        channelId: "new_message",
        channelName: "message push",
        channelDescription: "push new messages");
```

##### `displayNotification`

This API requires `title`, `body`, and `ext` for the redirect. You can parse the `V2TimMessage` as needed to generated them.

To facilitate the redirect, view the `displayDefaultNotificationForMessage` code for the `ext` generation rule.

```dart
cPush.displayNotification(
  channelID: "new_message",
  channelName: "message push",
  title: "",
  body: "",
  ext: ""
);
```

##### `displayDefaultNotificationForMessage`

We recommend you use this API to automatically generate a notification based on `V2TimMessage`.

You only need to pass in a `V2TimMessage` object.

```dart
cPush.displayDefaultNotificationForMessage(
        message: message, channelID: "new_message", channelName: "message push");
```

### Notification tap-to-redirect

Like the callback for click in [step 6](#step_6), this callback is in `ext`. It reads and redirects the receiver to the corresponding conversation.

If you use `displayDefaultNotificationForMessage` in the previous step or use the `ext` generation function identical to the default in `displayNotification`, `ext` will be in the structure of `"conversationID": "corresponding conversation"`.

Enter the callback method configured for `pushClickAction`.

During initialization, register the callback method to get the `Map` containing the push body and `ext` information.

>? If the receiver is redirected when the application is in the background, the Flutter homepage may have been unmounted and cannot provide a context for the redirect. Therefore, we recommend you cache a context upon start to ensure the success of the redirect.
>
> We recommend you call the `clearAllNotification()` method to clear other notifications on the notification bar after the redirect to avoid too many Chat messages.

```Dart
BuildContext? _cachedContext;
final TimUiKitPushPlugin cPush = TimUiKitPushPlugin(
  isUseGoogleFCM: true, // This parameter is unavailable in the Chinese mainland edition.
);

@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  _cachedContext = context;
}

void onClickNotification(Map<String, dynamic> msg) async {
    String ext = msg['ext'] ?? "";
    Map<String, dynamic> extMsp = jsonDecode(ext);
    String convId = extMsp["conversationID"] ?? "";

    // Do not redirect if the current conversation is the target conversation
    // We recommend you check the current page opened by the user.

    final targetConversationRes = await TencentImSDKPlugin.v2TIMManager
        .getConversationManager()
        .getConversation(conversationID: convId);

    V2TimConversation? targetConversation = targetConversationRes.data;

    if(targetConversation != null){
      cPush.clearAllNotification();
      Navigator.push(
          _cachedContext ?? context,
          MaterialPageRoute(
            builder: (context) => Chat(
              selectedConversation: targetConversation,
            ),
          ));
    }
  }
```

If you customize the `ext` structure, you need to implement the redirect function on your own.

At this point, you have connected to online push. After the test is passed, you can define the timing and scenario for triggering a push notification in `onRecvNewMessage`.
