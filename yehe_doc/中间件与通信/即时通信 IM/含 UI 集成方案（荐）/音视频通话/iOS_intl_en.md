TUIKit 4.8.50 and later versions provide audio/video call features and support interconnection between iOS, Android, and web platforms.

> ? 
> - **TUIKit 6.5.xxxx and later versions provide upgraded audio/video call features with brand-new TUICallKit. To use these upgraded features, you need to purchase the dedicated IM audio/video call capability package.** The purchase method is described in [**Step 1. Activate the TRTC Service**](#step1). If you have already activated the TRTC service, ignore this step.
> - It should be noted that the integration method varies depending on the TUIKit version, as described in [Version Description](#version). **You are advised to upgrade to 6.5.2816 or later. This document focuses on the integration solutions for 6.5.2816 or later.**

Audio/Video call UIs are shown as follows:

## Step 1: Activate the TRTC Service
1. Log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im) and click the target app card to go to the basic configuration page of the app.
2. Click **Free trial** under **Activate Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC)** in the lower-right corner of the page to activate the 60-day free trial service of TUICallKit. 
>= **Notes**: If you have used [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) before, after clicking **Free trial**, the following error may occur: `[-100013]:TRTC service is suspended. Please check if the package balance is 0 or the Tencent Cloud account is in arrears`.
>
>This is because the new IM audio/video call capability is based on two basic PaaS services: [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35078) and [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35448). If you have used up your free monthly minutes (10,000) for TRTC, you will fail to activate the capability. You can log in to the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc/app), go to the application management page of the corresponding SDKAppID, and activate the pay-as-you-go feature, as shown in the figure below. Then, next time when you **start the application**, you can experience the new audio/video call capability properly.

## Step 2: Integrate the TUICallKit Component

1. Add the following content to the Podfile.
```objectivec
// Integrate the TUICallKit component
pod 'TUICallKit'                  
```
2. Run the following command to download the third-party library to the current project:
```sh
pod install
```
 If you cannot install the latest TUIKit version, run the following command to update the local CocoaPods repository list:
```sh
 pod repo update
```

## Step 3: Enable/Disable Audio/Video Call

TUICallKit and TUIChat can be freely combined. After TUICallKit is integrated, the audio and video call features are enabled for TUIChat by default and their entries are displayed on the More menu on the chat UI.

If you want to dynamically enable or disable the audio/video call entry in TUIChat, configure `enableVideoCall` and `enableAudioCall` in `TUIChatConfig` before entering the chat UI.
Sample code:
```
[TUIChatConfig defaultConfig].enableVideoCall = NO; // `YES`: Enable. `NO`: Disable
[TUIChatConfig defaultConfig].enableAudioCall = NO; // `YES`: Enable. `NO`: Disable
```

## Step 4: Offline Push

Before using offline push, you need to activate the [IM offline push](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/39157) service. For application configuration, you can refer to [Integrating TUIOfflinePush and Running the Offline Push Feature](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/47949).

**After the configuration is completed, when you click a received audio/video call notification pushed offline, TUICallKit automatically opens the audio/video call invitation UI.**

## FAQs

[](id:question1)

#### What should I do if I receive the error message "The package you purchased does not support this ability"?
The error message indicates that your app's **audio/video call capability package has expired or is not activated**. You can refer to [step 1](#step1) to claim or activate the audio/video call capability to continue using TUICallKit.

#### How do I purchase a package?
The audio/video call SDK **is currently in beta, with a 60-day free edition provided**. The official paid edition is expected to be released in December 2022. Please stay tuned.

#### Will an invitee receive a call invitation immediately if the invitee goes offline and then online within the call invitation timeout duration?

- If the call invitation is started in a one-to-one chat, the invitee can receive the call invitation, and the TUIKit will automatically open the call invitation UI internally.
- If the call invitation is started in a group chat, the invitee will see the last 20 call invitations, and the TUICallKit will automatically open the group call UI.

#### What should I do if TUICallKit conflicts with an audio/video library that I have integrated?

TUICallKit and Tencent Cloud [audio/video libraries](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/34615) cannot be integrated at the same time. Otherwise, symbol conflicts may occur. Do as follows:

- If you have integrated the `TXLiteAVSDK_TRTC` library, no symbol conflict will occur, and you can directly add dependency in the Podfile as follows:
```sh
pod 'TUICallKit'
```
- If you have integrated the `TXLiteAVSDK_Professional` library, symbol conflicts will occur, and you can add dependency in the Podfile as follows:
```sh
pod 'TUICallKit/Professional'
```
- If you have integrated the `TXLiteAVSDK_Enterprise` library, symbol conflicts will occur, and you are advised to upgrade it to `TXLiteAVSDK_Professional` before using `TUICallKit/Professional`.

#### What should I do if "ld: framework not found BoringSSL clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1  sdk" is reported after TUICallKit is integrated?

The audio/video library on which TUICallKit relies currently does not support simulators. Please use real devices for demo running or debugging.

#### What should I do if I am using TUICalling of an earlier version and want to upgrade the IM-related components (TUIChat/TUIConversation/TUIGroup/TUIContact/TUISearch/TUIOfflinePush) separately?

The last stable CocoaPods version for TUICalling is v9.6.4. If you use CocoaPods for integration, you only need to upgrade the version numbers of the IM-related components. If you use manual integration, you only need to replace the source code of the IM-related components.

TUICalling and TUICallKit can interconnect with each other, and you are advised to upgrade to the latest TUICallKit.
