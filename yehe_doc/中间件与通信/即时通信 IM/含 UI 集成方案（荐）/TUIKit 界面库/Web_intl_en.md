## TUIKit Overview
TUIKit is a UI component library based on Tencent Cloud IM SDK. It provides universal UI components to offer features such as conversation, chat, relationship chain, group, and audio/video call features.
With these UI components, you can quickly build your own business logic.
When implementing UI features, components in TUIKit will also call the corresponding APIs of the IM SDK to implement IM-related logic and data processing, allowing developers to focus on their own business needs or custom extensions.


## TUIKit Components
TUIKit provides the following modules for different purposes: TUIChat, TUIConversation, TUIProfile, and TUIManage modules. For details, see [the open source code here](!https://github.com/TencentCloud/chat-uikit-react).
The TUIKit web UI effect is as follows:
