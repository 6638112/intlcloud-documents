## Feature Description
- This API imports one-to-one chat history to IM.
- It imports your messages from other instant messaging platforms to Tencent Cloud IM.
- It updates a conversation.
- It does not trigger a callback.
- It deduplicates the imported messages in a one-to-one conversation based on the `MsgSeq`, `MsgRandom`, and `MsgTimeStamp` fields. **When the values of all these three fields match their counterparts, the two messages are considered duplicates, regardless of their contents.** In addition, if the `MsgSeq`, `MsgRandom`, and `MsgTimeStamp` fields of the two messages matches each other, but `from_account` and `to_account` are opposite, the two messages are also considered duplicates.
- Imported messages will not be overwritten by the same messages from later imports.
- For one-to-one messages, the `MsgSeq` field is specified by the user when the message is sent. Its value can be repeated. It is not generated by the backend and not globally unique. **For group chat messages, the value of the `MsgSeq` field is generated by the backend, and each group maintains its respective `MsgSeq` which increases strictly from 1. For one-to-one messages, the historical messages of the same conversation are sorted by timestamp first, and then the historical messages of the same second are sorted by `MsgSeq`.**
