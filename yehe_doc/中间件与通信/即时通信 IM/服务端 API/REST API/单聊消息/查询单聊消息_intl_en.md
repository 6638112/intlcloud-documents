## Feature Overview
- This API is used by the app admin to query the message history of a one-to-one conversation from the perspective of a party of the conversation based on a specified time range.
- The one-to-one conversation to be queried is specified by `Operator_Account` and `Peer_Account` in the request and the query is performed from the perspective of the party specified by `Operator_Account`. The query result contains the messages sent between both parties. The specific sender and recipient of each message are specified by `From_Account` and `To_Account` respectively.
- In most cases, the query result is the same if you perform the query from the perspective of either party of a one-to-one conversation. However, there are four cases where the results are different (some messages in the conversation can be queried by one party but not by the other party):
 - One party of the conversation has cleared the message history of the conversation by calling the terminal API [clearC2CHistoryMessage()](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMMessageManager.html#a29aa6e75c2238c35cc609bef0e5a46ce).
 - One party of the conversation has deleted the conversation by calling the terminal API [deleteConversation()](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMConversationManager.html#a7a6e38c5a7431646bd4c0c4c66279077), web/uni-app API [deleteConversation](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/im/doc/en/SDK.html#deleteConversation), or [server API for deleting a conversation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/43088) with `ClearRamble` being set to `1`.
 - One party of the conversation has deleted some messages in the conversation by calling the terminal API [deleteMessages()](https://im.sdk.qcloud.com/doc/en/classcom_1_1tencent_1_1imsdk_1_1v2_1_1V2TIMMessageManager.html#adb346fede13d493e415f6574df911e9a) or web/uni-app API [deleteMessage](https://web.sdk.qcloud.com/im/doc/en/SDK.html#deleteMessage).
 - For messages sent through [the API for sending one-to-one messages to one user](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) or [the API for sending one-to-one messages to multiple users](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920), `SyncOtherMachine` is set to `2`, indicating that specified messages are not synced to the message history of the other party of the conversation.
- The query result contains recalled messages indicated by the `MsgFlagBits` field.
- The `IsPeerRead` field in the query result indicates whether the recipient sends the read receipt of the message. The field value is `1` only when the recipient calls the [sendMessageReadReceipts (Android / iOS and Mac / Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/48022) or [sendMessageReadReceipt (Web&)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/48021) API.
- If you want to recall a message, you can first call this API to query the `MsgKey` of the message and then call the [RESTful API for recalling one-to-one messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35015) to recall the message.
- The time range of message records that can be queried depends on the roaming message storage period, which is seven days by default. You can modify the message roaming period via the Chat console. Extending the message roaming period is a value-added service. For more information, see [Message Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33524).
- If the total size of the messages within the requested time range exceeds the upper size limit (currently 13 KB) of the response, continued pulling is needed. You can see whether all the requested messages have been pulled by checking the `Complete` field in the response.

In the response, `"Complete": 0` indicates that not all messages generated within the time range have been pulled. Therefore, continued pulling is required.
**In the continued pulling request, the value of `MaxTime` must be changed to the value of `LastMsgTime` in the response, and the `LastMsgKey` in the response must be entered**, as shown below:

In the response, `"Complete": 1` indicates that all messages generated within the time range have been pulled.
If the value of `Complete` in the response is `0`, you need to continue pulling messages until the value of `Complete` becomes `1`.
