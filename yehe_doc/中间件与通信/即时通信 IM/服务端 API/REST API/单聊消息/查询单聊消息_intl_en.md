## Feature Description
- This API is used by the app admin to query the history of a one-to-one conversation based on a specified time range.
- The one-to-one conversation to be queried is specified by `From_Account` and `To_Account` in the request. The query result contains the messages sent between both parties. The specific sender and recipient of each message are specified by `From_Account` and `To_Account` respectively.
- In most cases, if you exchange the values of `From_Account` and `To_Account` in the request, the query result will remain unchanged. However, to query a message sent via the [v4/openim/sendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) API or [v4/openim/batchsendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920) API, if you set `SyncOtherMachine` to `2`, you must specify `From_Account` and `To_Account` correctly.
  For example, you have called the [v4/openim/sendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) API to specify account A to send a message to account B and set `SyncOtherMachine` to `2`. To query the message by calling this API, you must set `From_Account` to account B and `To_Account` to account A.
- The query result contains recalled messages indicated by the `MsgFlagBits` field.
- If you want to recall a message, you can first call this API to query the `MsgKey` of the message and then call the [v4/openim/admin_msgwithdraw](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35015) API to recall the message.
- The time range of message records that can be queried depends on the roaming message storage period, which is 7 days by default. You can modify the message roaming period via the IM console. Extending the message roaming period is a value-added service. For more information, see [Roaming Message Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33524).
- If the total size of the messages within the requested time range exceeds the upper size limit (currently 13 KB) of the response, continued pulling is needed. You can see whether all the requested messages have been pulled by checking the `Complete` field in the response.
