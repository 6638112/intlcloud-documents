## Feature Overview
- This API enables admins to recall group messages.
- This API enables the recall of all group messages valid for roaming, including group messages sent from a client and those sent with a RESTful API.
- To recall group messages sent from a client, enable [Callback After Sending Group Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34375) first, which records the `GroupId` and `MsgSeq` of each group message, and then enter the `GroupId` and `MsgSeqList` obtained from the callback in this API to recall the message. Alternatively, get info of group messages to be recalled with [Pulling Historical Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34971), and then recall the message with this API.
- To recall group messages sent with the RESTful API [Sending Ordinary Messages in a Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34959), get `MsgSeq` contained in the response packets of these APIs and then recall the messages.
- Once a message is recalled by this API, it is recalled from the local caches of the sender’s and recipients’ clients.
- This API can recall group messages sent for any period of time, but the group messages must be valid for roaming.
