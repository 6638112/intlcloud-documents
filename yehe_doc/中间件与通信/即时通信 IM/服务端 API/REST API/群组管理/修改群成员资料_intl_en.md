## Feature Description
 This API is used by the app admin to modify the profile of a group member.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | RESTful API Support |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as the meeting group (Meeting) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | Yes. The group profiles can be modified. |

These are the built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>?Audio-video groups do not store group member profiles and therefore do not allow member profile modification. They only support modifying the member profiles of admins and the group owner. Error 10007 will be returned if you try to modify the profiles of common group members.
