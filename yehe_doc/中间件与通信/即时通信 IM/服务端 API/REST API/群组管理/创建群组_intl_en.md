## Feature Description
This API is used by the app admin to create groups.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | RESTful API Support |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | Yes. |
|Community | Yes.  |

These are the built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>!
>- If the group type is specified as `AVChatRoom`:
>  - The number of groups that can be created varies depending on the actual package. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
>  - Inviting users to groups is not supported when `AVChatRoom` groups are created, and a 10007 error will be returned if users to invite are specified during creation. The only way for users to join `AVChatRoom` groups is to apply.
>- If the group type is specified as a type other than `AVChatRoom`:
>  - If neither a group owner nor a group member list is specified when the request is sent, the number of groups that can be created is unrestricted.
>  - If a group owner or group member list is specified when the request is sent, the specified group owner or group members are automatically added to the group.
>- If the total number of groups in the app exceeds 100,000, certain fees will be charged. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).
>- A user account can only join a limited number of groups. Therefore, when that limit is exceeded, joining or creating groups will fail. For more information, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350).

## Error Codes

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the returned HTTP status code for this API is always 200. The specific error code and details can be found in the response packet fields `ErrorCode` and `ErrorInfo` respectively.
For public error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The list below contains error codes specific to this API.

| Error Code | Description |
|---------|---------|
| 10002 | Internal server error. Please try again. |
| 10003| Invalid request command word. |
| 10004 | Invalid parameter. Check the error description and troubleshoot the issue. |
| 10005 | The number of members imported in the request packet exceeds 100. Reduce the number of members imported in the `MemberList` parameter. |
| 10006 | The number of groups created exceeds the quota. For example, the cumulative number of BChatRoom groups created exceeds 5, or the net increase in the number of groups in a single day exceeds the set quota. For details, see [Differences in group limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#.E7.BE.A4.E7.BB.84.E9.99.90.E5.88.B6.E5.B7.AE.E5.BC.82). |
| 10007 | Insufficient permissions. Check the request parameters based on the error information. For example, the specified group type does not allow adding members, but you specified `MemberList` in the request packet. |
| 10008 | The request is invalid, probably because verification of the signing information in the request failed. Please try again or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=29&level2_id=40&source=0&data_title=%E4%BA%91%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%20%20IM&step=1). |
| 10016 | The app backend rejected this operation through a third-party callback. Check the returned value of your callback service "Callback before creating a group". |
| 10021 | The group ID has already been used by another user. Select another group ID. |
|10025 | You have already used this group ID. Delete the existing group first or select another group ID. |
| 10036 | The number of AVChatRoom groups created exceeds the limit. Delete some AVChatRoom groups first or refer to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) to purchase an upgrade. |
| 10037 | The request specifies Owner_Account, but the number of groups that the group owner has created or joined exceeds the limit. The group owner needs to quit some groups first or refer to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) to purchase an upgrade. |
| 10038 | The number of members imported in the request packet exceeds the limit. Reduce the number of members imported in the `MemberList` parameter or refer to [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34350) to purchase an upgrade. |
