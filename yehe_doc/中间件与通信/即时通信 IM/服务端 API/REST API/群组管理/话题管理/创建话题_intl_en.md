| 10003 | Invalid command word. |
| 10004 | Invalid parameter. Check the error description and troubleshoot the issue. |
| 10006 | The operation exceeds the frequency limit. Reduce the call frequency. This error is usually caused by too much net group increase in a single day or too frequent calls to obtain all groups in the app. |
| 10007 | Insufficient operation permissions. Check the request parameters based on the error message. |
| 10008 | The request is invalid, probably because verification of the signing information in the request failed. Try again or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=29&level2_id=40&source=0&data_title=%E4%BA%91%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%20%20IM&step=1). |

|10025 | You have already used this group ID. Disband the existing group first or select another group ID. |

To use this feature, you need to purchase the [Ultimate edition](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/1047/34577) and apply for enablement as instructed in [Configuration Change Ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/44322).|
