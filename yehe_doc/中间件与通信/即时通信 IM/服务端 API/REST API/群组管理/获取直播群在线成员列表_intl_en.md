### Sample request

This API is used to get the number of online members in an audio-video group (AVChatRoom), which is collected once every 10 seconds.

```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#a6I4ZUUGO",
    "Timestamp": 0
}
```

Only the group members marked as `1000` will be obtained.

```
{
    "GroupId":"@TGS#a6I4ZUUGO",
    "Mark": 1000,
    "Timestamp": 0
}
```

### Request fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GroupId | String | Yes | Group ID  |
| Timestamp | Integer | Yes | For the first request, pass in `0`. When there are a large number of members in an audio-video group, the backend will return a `Timestamp` that is not `0`, indicating that a paged pull is needed. Pass in the `Timestamp` in subsequent requests until the backend returns `0`. |

### Sample response
```
{
    "ActionStatus": "OK",
    "ErrorCode": 0,
    "ErrorInfo": "",
    "MemberList": [
        {
            "JoinTime": 1657773110,
            "Member_Account": "teacher2",
            "NickName": "Teacher t02",
            "Avatar": "http://www.example.com/teacher2.jpg"
        }
    ],
    "NextTimestamp": 0
}
```
### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ActionStatus | String | Request result. Valid values: `OK`: succeeded; `FAIL`: failed. |
| ErrorCode |	Integer	| Error code. Valid values: `0`: succeeded; other values: failed. |
