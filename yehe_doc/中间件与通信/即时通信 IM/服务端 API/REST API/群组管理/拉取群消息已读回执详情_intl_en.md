### Sample request
Pull the list of members who have or have not read a group message in batches:
- **Basic format**
You can use the `Cursor` and `Count` fields to control the pulling-by-page mode:
 - `Count`: Specifies the maximum number of members in the `ReadList` or `UnreadList` array in the response. Maximum value: 200
 - `Cursor`: Specifies a member position from which subsequent information is to be pulled. For the first request, the client request parameter `Cursor` must pass in "". For the last request, the server returns `1` for the `IsFinish` parameter, indicating that the information pulling ends.
