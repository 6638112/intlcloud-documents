## Background

- IM group messages are sorted by seq, and seq is allocated according to the order in which group messages are received by the server. The seq is greater for group messages sent earlier and smaller for group messages sent later.
- To pull all the messages of a group, you do not need to enter the seq for the initial pull. Instead, the server automatically returns the latest messages. For subsequent pulls, enter the previously returned smallest seq minus 1.
- If the value of `IsPlaceMsg` in the returned message is `1`, it indicates that the message with this seq has expired, failed to be stored, or been deleted.

## Feature Description

This API allows the app administrator to pull the historical messages of a group.

## API Call Description
### Applicable group types

### Sample request packets

- **Basic request**
Pulls the historical messages of a group. The most recent `ReqMsgNumber` group messages will be returned.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#15ERQPAER",    // The ID of the group of which messages are to be pulled
    "ReqMsgNumber": 2      // The number of messages to be pulled
}
```

- **Pulling by seq**
Pulls the historical messages of a group based on the specified seq.
The seq of the returned messages is less than or equal to the `ReqMsgNumber` of `ReqMsgSeq`.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#15ERQPAER",
    "ReqMsgSeq": 7803321,       // The maximum seq of the requested messages. The messages with a seq less than or equal to `ReqMsgSeq` will be returned.
    "ReqMsgNumber": 2
}
```

### Request packet fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GroupId | String | Yes | The ID of the group of which messages are to be pulled |
