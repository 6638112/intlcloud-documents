>!This document is only for users who are migrating their apps to Tencent Cloud IM.
## Feature Description
- This API is used by app admins to set the unread message count of a group member. When this API is called, no callback is triggered and no notification is sent.
- When you are migrating your app from another IM system to Tencent Cloud IM, you can use this API to set the unread message count of group members.

## API Call Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | RESTful API Support |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as work group (Work) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | No. Same as meeting group (Meeting) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No. |
|Community|Yes.|

These are the built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>?ChatRoom and AVChatroom (audio-video) groups do not support unread message counts. Therefore, you cannot set an unread message count for members of these two group types. If you try to do so, no error will be returned.
