  >?You can log to the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im) and click an app to view its standard billing plan in **Basic Configuration** > **Standard Billing Plan** > **Plan**.
- When an account is deleted, the account’s data such as relationship chain and profile will also be deleted.
- After an account is deleted, **the account’s data cannot be recovered**. Therefore, exercise caution when using this API.
