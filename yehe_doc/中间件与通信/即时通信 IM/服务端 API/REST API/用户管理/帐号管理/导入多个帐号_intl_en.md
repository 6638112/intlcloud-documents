## Feature Overview
This API is used to batch import app-owned accounts to Tencent Cloud Chat and create an internal ID for each of these accounts to ensure that these accounts can use the Chat service.

>?
- This API can import up to 100 accounts at a time. If an account is imported repeatedly, only one internal ID will be created for it.
- This API is unable to import account nicknames and profile photos. You can call the [Setting Profiles](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34916) API to set account nicknames and profile photos.
