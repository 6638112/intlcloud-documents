## Feature Overview
- This API is used to import group members without triggering callbacks or delivering notifications.
- When your app needs to be migrated to Chat from another instant messaging system, you can use this API to import existing group member data.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Applicable |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as work groups (Work) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as meeting groups (Meeting) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No |
| Community | Yes |

Above are the built-in group types of the Chat service. For more information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>?Generally, importing group members is not required for audio-video groups (AVChatRoom), so audio-video groups do not support this API. If you attempt to use this API on an audio-video group, error 10007 will be returned.

### Sample request

You can call this API to initiate a request to import members to a group. A single request can import up to 300 members. If the unread message count specified by this API is greater than the current number of messages of the group, the unread message count is set to the current number of messages of the group.
>!Before importing a member, ensure that the time that the member joined the group is later than the group creation time and earlier than the current time. Otherwise, the member cannot be imported.

```

    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // (Required) Target group

    {

        "Role":"Admin", // (Optional) Role of the group member to be imported. Currently, the only supported role is Admin.
        "JoinTime":1448357837, // (Optional) Time when the group member to be imported joined the group
        "UnreadMsgNum":5          // (Optional) Unread message count of the member
