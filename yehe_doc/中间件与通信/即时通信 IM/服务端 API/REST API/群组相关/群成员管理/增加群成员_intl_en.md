### Sample request

- **Basic format**
Used to invite users to a group. A single request supports adding up to 300 members. By default, the backend delivers group system notifications to all group members, except for private groups (or work groups in the new version) that have not been activated.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // (Required) Target group
    "MemberList": [ // Up to 300 members can be added at a time.
    {
        "Member_Account": "tommy" // The ID of the member to be added (required)
    },
    {
        "Member_Account": "jared"
    }]
}
```

- **Adding members silently**
When `Silence` is set to `1`, the system does not notify anyone after successfully adding members.
```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // (Required) Target group
    "Silence": 1, // Whether to add members silently (optional)
    "MemberList": [ // Up to 300 members can be added at a time.
    {
        "Member_Account": "tommy" // The ID of the member to be added (required)
    },
    {
        "Member_Account": "jared"
    }]
}
```

## Error Codes
The returned HTTP status code for this API is always 200 unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs. The specific error code and details can be found in the response fields `ErrorCode` and `ErrorInfo` respectively.
For public error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API:

| Error Code | Description |
|---------|---------|
| 10002 | Internal server error. Try again. |
| 10003 | Invalid command word. |
| 10004 | Invalid parameter. Check the error description and troubleshoot the issue. |
| 10005 | The number of member accounts in the request packet exceeds 300. |
| 10007 | No operation permissions. In this case, check whether the group type supports user invitation. For example, AVChatRoom and BChatRoom groups do not allow anyone to invite others to the groups. |
| 10014 | The users in the request cannot be added to the group because the group is already full. In this case, try deleting some `Member_Account` in the request or change the value of the `MaxMemberNum` field in the basic group information. For information, see the **Basic group information** section in [Group basic information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529#GroupBaseInfoFilter). |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been deleted. |
| 10015 | Invalid group ID. Use a correct group ID. |
| 10016 | The developer backend has rejected this operation through a webhook. |
| 10019 | The UserID does not exist. Make sure all the accounts specified in `Member_Account` are correct. |
| 10026 | The command word of the `SDKAppID` request is disabled. Contact customer service. |
| 10037 | The number of groups that the invited user has joined exceeds the limit. In this case, check and delete the `Member_Account` that has joined excessive groups, or purchase an upgrade based on the your need.
