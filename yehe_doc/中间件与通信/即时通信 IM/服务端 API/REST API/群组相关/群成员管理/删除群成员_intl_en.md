## Feature Overview
 This API is used by app admins to delete group members.

## API Calling Description

### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | RESTful API Support |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as work groups (Work) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as meeting groups (Meeting) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No |
| Community | Yes |

These are the preset group types in Chat. For more information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>?Audio-video groups (AVChatRoom) do not support deleting group members. If you attempt to delete members of an audio-video group, error 10004 will be returned. To achieve the effect of deleting group members, admins can [batch mute and unmute group members](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34951).

### Maximum call frequency

### Sample request

- **Basic format**
Used to delete group members. A single request supports deleting up to 100 group members. By default, the backend sends system notifications on the group member deletion to all group members, except for Private groups (same as Work groups in the new version) that have not been activated.
Even if a user to be deleted is not in the group, the API will still return success.
```json
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // Target group (required)
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // List of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 100 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```
- **Silent deletion**
When `Silence` is set to `1`, the system will not notify anyone after successfully deleting a member.
```json
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // Target group (required)
    "Silence": 1, // Whether to delete members silently (optional)
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // List of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 100 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```
- **Specifying the reason for deletion**
Specify the reason for deleting a user from a group, which will be reflected in the delivered notification.
```json
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // Target group (required)
    "Reason": "kick reason", // Reason for deleting a user from a group (optional)
    "MemberToDel_Account": [ // List of group members to be deleted. A maximum of 100 members can be deleted.
        "tommy",
        "jared"
    ]
}
```

### Request fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GroupId | String | Yes | ID of the target group  |

| MemberToDel_Account | Array | Yes | Group members to be deleted   |

### Sample response

For public error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The following table describes the error codes specific to this API:

| 10003 | Invalid command word. |
| 10004 | Invalid parameter. Check the error description and troubleshoot the issue. |
