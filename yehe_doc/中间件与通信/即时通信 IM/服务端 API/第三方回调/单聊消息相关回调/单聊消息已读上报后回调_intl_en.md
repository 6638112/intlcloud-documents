## Feature Description

This API is used by the app backend to monitor one-to-one message reads in real time.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and enable the corresponding switch for this callback. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTPS POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Trigger Scenarios

- An app user marks a one-to-one message as read on the client.
- An app admin marks a one-to-one message as read by calling the [admin_set_msg_read](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/38996) API.

## Callback Trigger Timing

After a one-to-one message is marked as read

## API Calling Description

  "Peer_Account": "Jonh", // The other party in the conversation
  "LastReadTime": 1614754606, // Read time
  "UnreadMsgNum": 7 // Total number of unread one-to-one messages of `Report_Account`
}
```
