## Feature Description
This callback allows you to view the changes in the topic profile (topic name, topic introduction, topic notice, and topic profile photo) in real time on the application backend. Specifically, you can view the real-time log of the changed topic profile or sync the information to other systems.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL. This callback and the callback after group profile modification use the same switch. For detailed directions, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

### Callback triggering content

The topic profile includes the basic topic profile and custom topic field.
Currently, this callback may be triggered by a change in the topic name, topic introduction, topic notice, or topic profile photo URL, and will not be triggered by a change in other basic topic profile.

### Callback triggering methods

- The application user modifies the topic profile on the client.
- The application admin modifies the topic profile through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

It will be triggered after the topic profile is changed.
