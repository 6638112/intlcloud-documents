## Overview

This API is used by the app backend to view the recalls of group messages in real time.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and enable the corresponding switch for this callback. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Trigger Scenarios

- An app user recalls a group message on the client.
- An app admin recalls a group message via calling the RESTful API.

## Callback Trigger Timing

After a group message is recalled successfully
