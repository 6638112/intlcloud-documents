## Feature Overview

This callback allows you to view the information of the topic created by the user on the application backend in real time. Specifically, it notifies the application backend of the successful topic creation so that the backend can sync data.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the URL. This callback and the callback after group creation use the same switch. For detailed directions, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).
- You need to [enable the topic feature in the console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34419) before using it.

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- The application user created a topic successfully on the client.
- The application admin created a topic successfully through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

It will be triggered after a topic is created successfully.
