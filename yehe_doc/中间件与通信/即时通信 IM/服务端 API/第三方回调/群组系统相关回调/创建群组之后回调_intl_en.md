## Feature Overview

This callback allows you to view the information of the group created by the user on the application backend in real time. Specifically, it notifies the application backend of the successful group creation so that the backend can sync data.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user creates a group successfully on the client.
- The app admin creates a group successfully through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

It will be triggered after a group is created successfully.

## API Calling Description

| EventTime | Integer | Event trigger timestamp in milliseconds |

### Sample response

A response is sent after the app backend synchronizes the data.

```
