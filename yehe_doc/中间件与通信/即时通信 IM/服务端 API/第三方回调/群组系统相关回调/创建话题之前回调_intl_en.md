## Feature Overview

This callback allows you to view the user's topic creation request on the application backend in real time. In addition, the application backend can reject the request.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the URL. This callback and the callback before group creation use the same switch. For detailed directions, see [Webhook Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).
- You need to [enable the topic feature in the console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34419) before using it.

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- The application user creates a topic on the client.
- The application admin creates a topic through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

It will be triggered before the IM backend creates a topic.

## API Calling Description

### Sample request URL

In the following sample, the callback URL configured in the app is `https://www.example.com`.

### Sample response

#### Creation allowed

The user is allowed to create a topic.

}
```

#### Creation refused

The user is not allowed to create a topic. No topic will be created, and the error code `10016` will be returned to the caller.

```json
{
    "ActionStatus": "OK",
    "ErrorInfo": "",

}
```
