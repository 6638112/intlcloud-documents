## Feature Overview

This callback allows you to view the group leaving status of users on the app backend. You can record the group leaving information of users in real time, for example, by recording a log or syncing the information to another system.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user leaves the group on the client.
- An app user removes a group member from the group on the client.
- The app admin deletes a group member through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

This callback will be triggered after a user leaves the group or is removed from the group by the group owner/admin.
