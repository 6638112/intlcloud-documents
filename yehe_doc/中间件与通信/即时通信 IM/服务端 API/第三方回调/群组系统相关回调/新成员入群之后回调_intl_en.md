## Feature Overview

This callback allows you to view the messages of group member join on the application backend in real time. Specifically, it notifies the application backend of group join so that the app can sync data as necessary.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- An app user sends a request to join the group on the client, and the request is approved.
- An app user successfully invites another user to join the group on the client.
- The app admin adds a user to a group through the RESTful API.

## Callback Triggering Timing

- This callback will be triggered after a user requests to join a group and successfully joins the group.
- This callback will be triggered after a user is invited by another member and successfully joins the group.
- This callback will be triggered after a user is added to a group by the app admin through the RESTful API.
