## Feature Description

This callback allows you to view the profile update operations by users in real time on the app backend.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and toggle on the corresponding protocol. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Triggering Scenarios

- App users modify their profiles through the client.
- App admins modify user profiles through RESTful APIs.

## Callback Triggering Timing

This callback is triggered after the user profile is successfully modified.
