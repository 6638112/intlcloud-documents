## Feature Description

This API is used by the app backend to:

- View responses to friend requests in real time.
- Block malicious responses to friend requests.



## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure a callback URL and enable the corresponding switch for this callback. For more information on the configuration method, see [Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTP POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the `SDKAppID` contained in the request URL is the `SDKAppID` of the app.
- For more security considerations, see the **Security Considerations** section in [Third-Party Callback Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Trigger Scenarios

- An app user initiates a response to accept or reject a friend request.

## Callback Trigger Timing

IM backend receives a response from an app user to a friend request.

>!Responses initiated via RESTful API calls to friend requests will not trigger the callback.

## API Calling Description
### Sample request URL

In the following sample, the callback URL configured in the app is `https://www.example.com`.
**Sample:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request parameters

| --- | --- |
| https | The request protocol is HTTPS and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | Callback URL |
