This document describes how to quickly run the IM demo for Flutter.

## Environment Requirements

| Platform | Version |
|---------|---------|
| Flutter | 2.2.0 or later|
| Android | Android Studio 3.5 or later; devices with Android 4.1 or later for apps |
| iOS | Xcode 11.0 or later. Ensure that your project has a valid developer signature. |

## Prerequisites

You have [signed up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) for a Tencent Cloud account and completed [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Directions
[](id:step1)

### Step 1. Create an app
1. Log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).
>? If you already have an app, record its SDKAppID and [obtain key information](#step2).
>A Tencent Cloud account can create a maximum of 300 IM apps. If you want to create a new app, [disable and delete](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34540) an unwanted app first. **Once an app (along with its SDKAppID) is deleted, the provided service and all its data are lost. Please proceed with caution**.
>
2. Click **Create Application**, enter your app name, and click **Confirm**.

3. After creation, you can see the status, service version, SDKAppID, creation time, and expiry time of the new app on the overview page of the console. Record the SDKAppID.

4. Click the created app. In the left sidebar, click **Auxiliary Tools** > **UserSig Tools** to create a UserID and the corresponding UserSig. Then copy the UserSig for future login.

### Step 2. Download the SDK and source code
1. Download the SDK and [demo source code](https://github.com/tencentyun/TIMSDK/tree/master/Flutter/Demo/im_discuss) that fit your needs.
2. Then, go to the directory TIMSDK/Flutter/Demo/im_discuss.

3. Run `Flutter pub get` to install the dependencies, launch the demo project, and enter the following command:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  plaintext
flutter run --dart-define=SDK_APPID=xxxx --dart-define=ISPRODUCT_ENV=false --dart-define=KEY=xxxx
:::
</dx-codeblock>

>? 
>-  Replace `xxxx` in `--dart-define=SDK_APPID=xxxx` with the SDKAppID created in [Step 1](#step1).
>-  Use `--dart-define=ISPRODUCT_ENV=false` to determine the environment (development or production). Enter “false” for a development environment.
>-  Replace `xxxx` in `--dart-define=KEY=xxxx` with the key mentioned in [Step 1](#step1).
>
4. Configure the launch.json file in the Visual Studio.

### Step 3 (optional). Run and debug the project in the IDE
<dx-tabs>
::: Android[](id:android)
1. Go to the discuss/andorid directory via Android Studio.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6516f9b17c58915c4ebc93c5c8829831.png)
2. Start an Android simulator, tap **Build And Run** to run the demo. Enter a random UserID (a combination of digits and letters).

>? The UI of the latest version of the demo may look different after adjustments.
:::
::: iOS[](id:ios)
1. Open Xcode and the file discuss/ios/Runner.xcodeproj:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6d74814ba9bce54c7439e8b3cea53e73.png)
2. Connect an iPhone, and click **Build And Run**. After the iOS project is built, the Xcode project will be displayed in a new pop-up window.
3. Open the iOS project, and set **Signing & Capabilities** (an iPhone developer account required) for the primary target to run the project on the iPhone.
4. Start the project and debug the demo on the iPhone device.

## FAQs

### What platforms are supported?
Currently, iOS, Android, and web platforms are supported. In addition, the editions for Windows and macOS are under development. Please stay tuned.

### What should I do if clicking **Build And Run** for an Android device triggers an error, stating no available device is found?
Check that the device is not occupied by other resources. Alternatively, click **Build** to generate an APK package, drag it to the simulator, and run it.

### What should I do if an error occurs during the first run for an iOS device?
If an error is reported for an iOS device after the demo configured as above is run, choose **Product** > **Clean** to clean the product, and build the demo again. You can also close Xcode and open it again, and then build the demo again.

### Flutter environment
If you want to check the Flutter environment, run `Flutter doctor` to detect whether the Flutter environment is ready.
