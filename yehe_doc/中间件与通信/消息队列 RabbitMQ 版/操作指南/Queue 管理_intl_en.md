## Overview

A queue is used to store messages. Each message will be put into one or more queues. Producers produce messages and deliver them to queues, and consumers pull messages from queues for consumption.

Multiple consumers can subscribe to the same queue. In this case, messages in the queue will be evenly distributed to such consumers for processing, rather than making each consumer receive and process all the messages.

This document describes how to create, delete, and query a queue in the TDMQ for RabbitMQ console.
