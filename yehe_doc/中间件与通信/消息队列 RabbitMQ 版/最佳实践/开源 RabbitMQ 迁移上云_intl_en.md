## Overview
This document describes how to migrate metadata from open-source RabbitMQ to TDMQ for RabbitMQ.

## Prerequisites

Before the metadata import, you need to first export the metadata file from open-source RabbitMQ. For metadata file export instructions, see [Export open-source RabbitMQ metadata](#export).

## Directions

### Export open-source RabbitMQ metadata[](id:export)

#### Export metadata via the console

1. Open the browser and log in to the open-source RabbitMQ console.
2. On the **Overview** tab page, click **Export definitions**, and enter the filename for download. Select “All” or a specific vhost for the “Virtual host” field and click **Download broker definitions** on the right to export the metadata file of all vhosts or the specified vhost.

#### Export metadata with the HTTP-based API of open-source RabbitMQ

1. Open the terminal.
2. Enter the command below to export the metadata file from open-source RabbitMQ.
	- Export the metadata of all vhosts:
	```plaintext
	wget http://<Open-source RabbitMQ IP address>:15672/api/definitions --user <Open-source RabbitMQ username>  --password <Open-source RabbitMQ password>  -O <Metadata file storage path>
	```
	- Export the metadata file of a specified vhost:
	```plaintext
	wget http://<Open-source RabbitMQ IP address>:15672/api/definitions/<Vhost name> --user <Open-source RabbitMQ username>  --password <Open-source RabbitMQ password>  -O <Metadata file storage path>
	```


<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
Currently, TDMQ for RabbitMQ doesn’t support the slash character “/”, but you don’t need to modify the metadata in case of such characters because TDMQ for RabbitMQ will escape the names that contain “/” when you import the metadata. The escape rules are as follows:
<li>The default RabbitMQ vhost name that starts with “/” will be renamed “__default_vhost__”.</li>
<li>For other vhost names that start with “/”, the slash character will be deleted and other characters will be retained.</li>
</dx-alert>



### Import the metadata to the TDMQ for RabbitMQ console

1. Log in to the [TDMQ for RabbitMQ console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdmq/rabbit-cluster) and click **Migration to Cloud** on the left sidebar.
2. On the **Migration to Cloud** page, select a region and click **Create Task**.

3. On the task creation page, create a task to import the open-source RabbitMQ metadata and fill in the required fields.

| Field       | Description                                                         |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Task Type   | Select either “Cluster migration” or “Vhost import”. If you select the former, the metadata of all the open-source RabbitMQ vhosts will be imported. If you select the latter, the metadata of a single vhost will be imported. |
| Cluster       | Select a target cluster that is to be imported. You can select an existing cluster or create a new one.     |
| Vhost Name  | This field is required if the task type is “Vhost import”.              |
| Message TTL   | This field specifies the ACK timeout of an unconsumed message. If the task type is “Cluster migration”, the metadata of all vhosts will be imported, and the message TTL will be applied to all the imported vhosts. To modify this field, you can select a cluster on the **Cluster** page, click the **Vhost** tab, and click **Edit** in the **Operation** column. |
| Metadata File | Select and upload a metadata file exported from open-source RabbitMQ. The file content can be modified in the editing box. For more information on the file format, see [Metadata file format description](#format). |

4. Click **Create Task** to submit the migration-to-cloud task.
After that, the metadata file format will be automatically verified. Once the verification is passed, you will be redirected to the **Migration to Cloud** page to view the migration progress.

>!Only one migration task can be executed in a TDMQ for RabbitMQ cluster at a time, that is, a new task can be created only after the last task is finished.


### View migration task details

1. Select a region on the [Migration to Cloud]https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdmq/rabbit-migrate page, and you can view the list of all migration tasks in this region.

2. The **Status** column displays the execution status of each migration task. Below are the status descriptions:

| Status     | Description                                                         |
| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Migrating   | The metadata file is being migrated.                                         |
| <nobr>Succeeded</nobr> | The metadata files of all vhosts have been successfully migrated.           |
| Failed | The metadata file of a single vhost failed to imported (for the “Vhost import” task type); or the metadata files of all vhosts failed to be imported (for the “Cluster migration” task type). |
| Some failed | The metadata files of some vhosts failed to be imported (for the “Cluster migration” task type).       |
| Timed out | The metadata file import timed out.                                       |

3. Click **View Details** in the **Operation** column to view the metadata file import details.
