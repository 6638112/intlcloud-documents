### Refund amount and method

**Refund amount = paid order amount - consumed resource amount**

Such amounts are calculated based on the **usage duration**:

Consumed resource amount = (usage duration / total amount) * original order price * current discount

A usage duration less than 1 day will be calculated as 1 day, and the current system discount matching the usage duration applies.
