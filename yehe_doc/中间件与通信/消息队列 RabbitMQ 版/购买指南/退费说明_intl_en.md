## 5-Day Unconditional Return

### Refund policy

- Each account can return **one** instance unconditionally within five (inclusive) days after purchase. The refund amount is **all the amount paid for purchase**, including cash, commission, and free credit amounts.
- Tencent Cloud has the right to reject any suspected abnormal or malicious application for return.

### Refund amount and method

Vouchers used for purchase are not refundable. Non-voucher payments will be proportionally refunded to the payer's Tencent Cloud account in accordance with the original payment method (cash or free credit) and percentage.


## Partial Refund

For prepaid Tencent Cloud products **not eligible for the 5-day unconditional full refund**, the refund policy is as follows:

### Refund policy

- Unit prices and discounts are subject to the current system offers.
- If the policy of the campaign where the product was purchased conflicts with the refund policy, the former shall prevail. If the campaign policy denies refunds, no refund can be made.
- Currently, self-service refund is unavailable for orders placed from promotion rewarding channels. You can submit a ticket to apply for a refund.
- Tencent Cloud has the right to reject any suspected abnormal or malicious application for return.

### Refund amount and method

**Refund amount = paid order amount - consumed resource amount**

Such amounts are calculated based on the **usage duration**:

Consumed resource amount = (usage duration / total amount) * original order price * current discount

A usage duration less than 1 day will be calculated as 1 day, and the current system discount matching the usage duration applies.
