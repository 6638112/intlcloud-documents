A dedicated instance is an advanced instance of API Gateway. Its underlying resources are exclusive to one user. Compared with shared instance, it can provide higher performance and SLA guarantee and thus is more suitable for use in production environments by large-sized customers. For the differences between shared and dedicated instances, see [Instance Selection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/40305).
