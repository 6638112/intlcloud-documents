API Gateway has two billing modes: pay-as-you-go (default) and resource pack. This document describes the billable items and prices in the former. For more information on the latter, see [Resource Pack Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/38407).

## Billable Items

Shared instance fees include API call fees and traffic fees.

### API calls

| Billable item | API calls |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Billing mode | Pay-as-You-Go |
| Billing cycle | Hourly |
| Bill generation time | Tencent Cloud generates hourly bills for API calls, typically within 30 minutes after the end of the current billing cycle. After a bill is generated, the fees will be automatically deducted from the account balance for settlement. If your account balance is insufficient to make the payment, your account will have overdue payment. |
| Deduction method | After a bill is generated, the fees will be automatically deducted from your account balance for settlement. |
| Billing currency | USD |
| Effective calls | Number of effective API call requests received by API Gateway. A request that is not a [frontend error](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/31717) will be considered as an effective call and billed. |

**After the API Gateway service is activated, the first one million calls in each calendar month in the first year are free of charge, and excessive calls will be billed at the tiered prices.**

### Public network outbound traffic

Public network outbound traffic refers to the outbound traffic from API Gateway to client. It is pay-as-you-go by the used public network traffic and settled hourly.

| Private network outbound traffic | Traffic generated by data transferred from API Gateway to the backend business over the Tencent Cloud private network        | Free of charge                                                         |
| Private network inbound traffic | Traffic generated by data transferred from the client to API Gateway over the Tencent Cloud private network          | Free of charge                                                         |
| Public network outbound traffic | Traffic generated by response data returned from API Gateway after data is transferred from the client to API Gateway over the internet | It is billed hourly and calculated by multiplying the unit price of each GB by the accumulative outbound traffic in an hour. |
| Public network inbound traffic | Traffic generated by data transferred from the client to API Gateway over the internet              | Free of charge                                                         |

> ?If your backend business and API Gateway are in different regions, or the backend business is not in Tencent Cloud, the fees generated by the traffic from API Gateway to your backend business will be billed additionally.

## Pricing

### API call fees

| Tier | Monthly Accumulative Excessive Calls (N) | Unit Price (USD/10,000 Calls) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Free tier | The first one million calls in each calendar month in the first year are free of charge | 0 |
| Tier 1 |  100 < N ≤ 10 million | 0.0089 |
| Tier 2 | 10 million < N ≤ 100 million | 0.0059 |
| Tier 3 | N > 100 million | 0.0045 |

### Public network outbound traffic price

| Region                                      | Unit Price (USD/GB) |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------: |
| Chinese mainland (excluding Hong Kong/Macao/Taiwan (China)), Singapore, Jakarta, Seoul, Tokyo, Frankfurt, and Moscow | 0.12                 |

**Billing example**
Suppose you purchase an EIP in Guangzhou region and use a total of 10 GB traffic between 07:00:00-07:59:59, then at 8:00:00, the payable fees will be 0.12 USD/GB * 10 GB = 1.2 USD.

>?
> - The traffic units are 1024-based. For example, 1 TB = 1,024 GB, and 1 GB = 1,024 MB.
> - Public network traffic refers to the downstream (i.e., outbound) traffic in bytes. During actual data transfer, the traffic generated over the network is around 5-15% more than the application-layer traffic, so the traffic calculated by Tencent Cloud may be about 10% more than that calculated by users themselves on the server.
>   - Consumption by TCP/IP headers: in TCP/IP-based HTTP requests, each packet has a maximum size of 1,500 bytes and includes TCP and IP headers of 40 bytes, which generate traffic during transfer but cannot be counted by the application layer. The overhead of this part is around 3%.
>   - TCP retransmission: during normal data transfer over the network, around 3-10% of packets are lost on the Internet and retransmitted by the server. This type of traffic cannot be counted by the application layer and accounts for 3-7% of the total traffic.

## Billing Examples

Billing for the Guangzhou region is as shown in the following example:
The backend business is in a different region from API Gateway and receives five million API calls cumulatively in a month, each of which returns a response of about 3 KB in size, and the size of each request of data forwarded from API Gateway to the backend business is 1 KB.

- API Gateway call fees = 5 million * 0.0089 USD/10,000 calls = 4.45 USD
- Total data transfer volume = 5 million * 3 KB = 15 million KB = 14.3 GB
- Total additional data transfer volume = 5 million * 1 KB = 5 million KB = 4.77 GB
- Total data transfer fees = 14.3 GB * 0.12 USD/GB + 4.77 GB * 0.12 USD/GB = 2.29 USD
- Total fees = 4.45 USD + 2.29 USD = 6.74 USD

## Refund Policy

Pay-as-You-Go instances can be released at any time, and billing will stop after they are released.

## Remarks

- For more information on the API Gateway overdue payment policy (data retention and destruction), see [Notes on Overdue Payment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11934).
- Public network outbound traffic fees but not API call fees are charged for APIs connected to WebSocket on the backend currently.
