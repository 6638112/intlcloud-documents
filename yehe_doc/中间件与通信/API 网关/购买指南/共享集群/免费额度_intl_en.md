New API Gateway users are eligible for the following limited-time free tier:

| Billable Item | Free Tier | Validity Period |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Number of calls   | The first one million calls in each calendar month | 12 calendar months in the first year after the service is activated |
| Public network outbound traffic   | The first one GB of traffic in each calendar month | 12 calendar months in the first year after the service is activated |

 

**Calculation of the validity period**

After the service is activated, the first one million calls in each calendar month in the first year (including the month when the service is activated) are free of charge.

For example, if you activate API Gateway at 17:13:14, November 10, 2019, then the one million free calls will be valid from November on. Unused calls in the free tier will not be accumulated for the next month; therefore, the monthly free tier will be reset at 00:00:00, December 1, 2019. The free tier will become unavailable after 23:59:59, November 10, 2020.
