API Gateway supports self-service refund for resource packs. You can perform self-service resource termination/return in the API Gateway console. The system will automatically refund your money and terminate/return cloud resources.

## Refund Policy

- Vouchers used for purchasing a resource pack are not refundable. Non-voucher fees will be fully refunded to the payer's Tencent Cloud account in accordance with the payment mode (cash or gift card). For more information, see [Order Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/deal).
- Self-Service refund is supported if the API Gateway resource pack meets the following four conditions:
  - The source of the resource pack is not the free tier.
  - The order type is **Purchase**.
  - Resources in the resource pack have not been used.
  - The resource pack is in the validity period.
