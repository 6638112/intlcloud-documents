## Overview
Tencent Cloud Web Application Firewall (WAF) is an AI-based one-stop web service protection solution.
This document describes how to integrate WAF to the API Gateway to protect your APIs.

## Prerequisites

- You have activated [Web Application Firewall](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/products/waf).
- You have released APIs using the API Gateway.

## Directions

### Step 1. Bind a custom domain name in the API Gateway console

For more information about how to bind a custom domain name in the API Gateway console, see [Custom Domain Name and Certificate](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/11791).

>! When a custom domain name is bound to the API Gateway console, the system will check whether you have configured CNAME and resolved it to the service subdomain name. Be sure to first configure CNAME and resolve it to the subdomain name of the API Gateway, modify the CNAME record, and point the custom domain name to the WAF domain name.

### Step 2. Configure WAF

1. Log in to the [WAF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/guanjia/waf/config).
2. Click **Web Application Firewall** > **Defense Settings** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **Add domains** at the top of the **Domain name list** module.
4. Select **Domain name** as the real server address and enter the subdomain name of the API Gateway. Complete the other configurations.
