## Notes
- You can select up to 10 services at a time.
- After a service is deleted, APIs under it will no longer provide services, and it cannot be restored. Therefore, please do so with caution.
- Tencent Cloud Serverless team provides a quick deletion tool. After simple configuration, you can quickly delete resources in batches. For more information on the tool, please see [Quick Deletion Tool](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/35955).
