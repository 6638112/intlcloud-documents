## Overview
This document describes how to manage keys in the API Gateway console.
- Creating a key: you can create a key using the **auto-generate key** or the **custom secret key** method. A successfully created key must be bound to an API using a usage plan so that the key can be used as a credential for accessing the API.
- Disabling/enabling a key: after a key is disabled, the API Gateway rejects all requests with signatures generated by using the key. After the key is enabled again, the API Gateway can properly process requests with signatures generated by using the key.
- Changing a key: you can reset the SecretKey of a key while the secret key name and SecretId remain unchanged.
- Deleting a key: you can delete a key in the **Disabled** state. A key in the **In Use** state cannot be deleted.

- A key in the **In Use** state cannot be deleted. To delete the key, disable it first.
- The SecretId of a custom key is unique across all regions. If you fail to create a custom key, change the SecretId and try again.
