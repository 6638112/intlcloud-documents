## Overview

The API debugging page allows you to verify the correctness of an API immediately after completing its configuration by initiating a simulated API call and viewing the specific request response. If the API fails to work as expected, you can modify the configuration according to the response to make it meet your design expectations.

## Prerequisites

You have [created an API ](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/44318).

## Directions

1. Find the API just created in [step 3](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/628/44318) on the API list page and click **Debug** in the **Operation** column to enter the API debugging page.
2. Select `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` as the `Content-Type`.
3. Click **Send Request** and view the result returned after debugging.
