## SDK Integration (Two Methods)

### Using Android Studio Gradle for automatic integration

1. In the `build.gradle` file in the Android project-level directory, add the Huawei repository address and HMS Gradle plugin dependencies under **repositories and dependencies** in **buildscript**, respectively:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        maven {url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/'}     // Huawei Maven repository address
    }
    dependencies {
        // Other `classpath` configurations
        classpath 'com.huawei.agconnect:agcp:1.6.0.300'     // Gradle plugin dependencies of Huawei Push
    }
}
```
2. In the `build.gradle` file in the Android project-level directory, add the Huawei dependency repository address under **repositories** in **allprojects**:
```
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        maven {url 'https://developer.huawei.com/repo/'}     // Huawei Maven repository address
    }
}
```
3. Copy the application configuration file `agconnect-services.json` obtained from the Huawei Push platform to the `app` module directory (not the submodule). 
 ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/338c87faaeb388f648835f17aeddc490.png)
4. Add the following configuration to the `build.gradle` file at its beginning in the `app` module (not the submodule `build.gradle`):
```
// Other Gradle plugins of application
apply plugin: 'com.huawei.agconnect'      // HMS Push SDK Gradle plugin
android {
    // Application configuration content
}
```
5. Import the dependencies related to Huawei Push into the `build.gradle` file under the `app` module:
```
dependencies {
		// ...Other dependencies of the program
		implementation 'com.tencent.tpns:huawei:[VERSION]-release'      //  For Huawei pushes, [VERSION] is the SDK's latest version number, which can be obtained from the release notes of SDK for Android.
		implementation 'com.huawei.hms:push:6.3.0.302'       // HMS Core Push module dependency package
		}
```

>?
> - For Huawei Push, `hms:push` depends on the preset `<queries>` tag compatible with Android 11 since v6.1.300. Please upgrade Android Studio to v3.6.1 or above and the Android Gradle plugin to v3.5.4 or above. Otherwise, errors may occur during project builds.
> - For Huawei pushes, [VERSION] is the SDK's latest version number, which can be obtained from the release notes of [SDK for Android](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/36191).
> - Starting from v1.2.1.3, TPNS SDK for Android officially supports Huawei Push v5. Please use TPNS Huawei dependency v1.2.1.3 or above to avoid integration conflicts.
>


### Using Android Studio for manual integration

If you cannot access Huawei Maven repository in your internal development environment, you can try the following manual integration method:

1. Download the [SDK installation package](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns/sdkdownload).
2. Open the `Other-Push-jar` folder and import the dependent packages related to Huawei Push v5 by copying all JAR and AAR packages into the project.
3. In the `build.gradle` file in the Android project-level directory, add HMS Gradle plugin dependencies under **dependencies** in **buildscript**:
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        // Other `classpath` configurations
        classpath files('app/libs/agcp-1.4.1.300.jar')     // Gradle plugin dependencies of Huawei Push
    }
}
```
4. Copy the application configuration file `agconnect-services.json` obtained from the Huawei Push platform to the `app` module directory.  
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/447e6453a5a996128b12c5ca9cdb10c7.png)
5. Add the following configuration to the `build.gradle` file at its beginning in the `app` module:
```
// Other Gradle plugins of application
apply plugin: 'com.huawei.agconnect'      // HMS Push SDK v4 Gradle plugin
android {
    // Application configuration content
}
```
6. Import the dependencies related to Huawei Push into the `build.gradle` file under the `app` module:
```
dependencies {
        // ...Other dependencies of the program
        implementation files('libs/tpns-huaweiv5-1.2.1.1.jar')      // TPNS plugin for HMS Core
        implementation fileTree(include: ['*.aar'], dir: 'libs')    // HMS Core Push module dependent package
    }
```
7. Add the following components between the `<application>` and `</application>` tags in the `manifest` file:
```
<application>
        <service
            android:name="com.huawei.android.hms.tpns.HWHmsMessageService"
            android:exported="false">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.huawei.push.action.MESSAGING_EVENT" />
            </intent-filter>
        </service>
</application>
```

## Huawei Push Activation

Enable the third-party push API before calling TPNS registration API `XGPushManager.registerPush`:

```
// Enable third-party push
XGPushConfig.enableOtherPush(getApplicationContext(), true);
```

The log of successful registration is as follows:

```
V/TPush: [XGPushConfig] isUsedOtherPush:true
E/xg.vip: get otherpush errcode: errCode : 0 , errMsg : success
V/TPush: [XGPushConfig] isUsedOtherPush:true
I/TPush: [OtherPushClient] handleUpdateToken other push token is : IQAAAACy0PsqAADxfCrWG3kupbOraeAiYoo9n2B-bAfb2d--kctc8E_UnY_mrIdg9ionukZvC******dVD8GlJi_5-0rpskunnNMcat35HA other push type: huawei
```

## Code Obfuscation

1. Add the following obfuscation rules in the `proguard-rules.pro` file at the application project level.
```
-ignorewarnings
-keepattributes *Annotation* 
-keepattributes Exceptions 
-keepattributes InnerClasses 
-keepattributes Signature 
-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable 
-keep class com.hianalytics.android.**{*;} 
-keep class com.huawei.updatesdk.**{*;} 
-keep class com.huawei.hms.**{*;}
-keep class com.huawei.agconnect.**{*;}
```

2. If the application uses the plug-in AndResGuard, add the following in the configuration allowlist of AndResGuard. Omit this step if AndResGuard is not used.
```
whiteList = [
"R.string.hms*",
"R.string.connect_server_fail_prompt_toast",
"R.string.getting_message_fail_prompt_toast",
"R.string.no_available_network_prompt_toast",
"R.string.third_app_*",
"R.string.upsdk_*",
"R.layout.hms*",
"R.layout.upsdk_*",
"R.drawable.upsdk*",
"R.color.upsdk*",
"R.dimen.upsdk*",
"R.style.upsdk*",
"R.string.agc*"
]
```

## Advanced Configuration (Optional)

### Configuring arrival receipt for Huawei channel

The arrival receipt for the Huawei channel should be configured by yourself. After configuring this feature as instructed in [Acquisition of Vendor Channel Arrival Receipt](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/35246), you can view the arrival data for the Huawei push channel in the push records.

### Badge adaptation for Huawei devices

You can set the application badge on Huawei devices after applying for the application badge setting permission and setting the application start class. For more information, see [Badge Adaption Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/35828).

## Troubleshooting

#### Querying Huawei Push registration error codes

The Huawei Push service has strict requirements on integration configuration. If you observe logs similar to the following, it indicates that registration with the Huawei channel fails. In that case, you can use the following method to get the Huawei Push registration error code.
```
[OtherPushClient] handleUpdateToken other push token is :  other push type: huawei
```

In debugging mode of the push service, filter logs by the keyword `OtherPush` or `HMSSDK` to view the return code logs, for example, `[OtherPushHuaWeiImpl] other push huawei onConnect code:907135702`. Then locate the error cause and rectify the error by referring to [Troubleshooting Vendor Channel Registration Failures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/37006).


#### Why are there no alerts for notifications delivered through the Huawei channel?

Starting from EMUI 10.0, Huawei Push intelligently categorizes notification messages into two levels: general and important. Versions below EMUI 10.0 don't categorize notifications but have only one level, so all notifications are displayed through the "default notification" channel, which is equivalent to the important level on EMUI 10.0. If a notification is categorized as "general", there will be no vibration, ringtone, or status bar icon alerts for it. Currently, the notification level can be set to "important" through the custom notification channel; however, according to the applicable Huawei Push rules, the final display effect will still be determined jointly by the set level and the level calculated by Huawei Push's intelligent categorization, and the lower level will prevail; for example, if the two levels are "important" and "general", "general" will prevail. For more information, see Huawei Message Classification User Guide [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/36250).
