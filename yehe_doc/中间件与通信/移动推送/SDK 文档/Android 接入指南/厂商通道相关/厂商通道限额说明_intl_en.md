## Vivo Channel Limits

### Quota description
#### Message push quota description
- Official messages include system messages and operation messages. The quota depends on the number of SDK subscriptions. A subscription number smaller than 10,000 will be counted as 10,000. If the number exceeds 10,000, the actual number of subscriptions will be counted. If you need to upgrade the system message volume, please see [How to Apply for Vivo System Message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/36250).
 - System message: includes emails, user-specified reminders, logistics messages, order messages, to-do/to-read, financial messages, feature reminders, and instant messages.
 - Operation message: includes but is not limited to operation-facilitating messages for advertisements, recommendations, promotions, as well as events, user-triggered messages, and unsubscribed video/audio messages, product promotions, advertisements, discounts, red pockets, and coupons.
- The number of testing system messages and testing operation messages that can be sent is limited to 10,000 per day and 100 per day, respectively. There can be up to 20 testing devices.
- Currently, the ratio of single push and group push is not limited. The number of users to whom the single/group push messages can be pushed should not exceed the total daily quota.

#### Message receive quota description

- A user can receive up to 5 operation messages a day from an application, while the number of system messages is not limited. This limit might be adjusted according to users’ feedback and experience. The specific quota is subject to the official announcement of Vivo.
- The number of messages a user can receive from an application is counted based on whether the number of messages **arrived** exceeds 5, which will be checked during message sending. If exceeded, Vivo will control and decide whether messages can still be sent to the device.

If the number of devices with the notification bar enabled is less than 10,000, it will be calculated as 10,000.
