## Overview

Currently, to avoid end users from being frequently disturbed, vendors are gradually restricting the number and frequency of notification messages pushed by application developers by type. The message type is mainly identified by the channel ID (`ChannelID`). Tencent Push Notification Service classifies messages into two types based on the types provided by major vendors:

- General message (default): This type is suitable for messages about group announcements, operational events, trending news, etc., which mainly contains user-oriented universal content.
- Notification message/private message: This type is suitable for personal notification-related messages such as chat messages, order status changes, and transaction reminders. The number of notification messages is unlimited.

The message type can be specified when you call the push API.
â€‹Meizu currently does not support message classification or limit the number of messages.

#### Directions

1. If you need to use vendor notification messages, apply for or create a channel ID as instructed in the following sections:
	- [OPPO](#oppozhinan)
	- [Mi](#xiaomizhinan)
	- [vivo](#vivozhinan)
	- [Huawei](#huaweizhinan)
>?After applying for the channel ID, specify it when using the push API.
2. If you need to manage channels by vendor, customize channel IDs to classify messages based on your application's business message types. You can make vendor-based configurations as below:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Push Channel</th>
<th>Configuration</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Tencent Push Notification Service channel</td>
<td><ul><li>On the application, call the channel ID creating API in the SDK for Android to create a channel ID.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID (no limit) when calling the Tencent Push Notification Service <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Huawei</td>
<td><ul><li><a href = "https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/message-classification-0000001149358835#section1653845862216">Apply for the self-help message classification permission for an application</a> in the Huawei console.

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mi</td>
<td><ul><li>Create a channel ID in the Mi open platform console or through the corresponding Mi server API.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the Tencent Push Notification Service <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OPPO</td>
<td><ul><li>On the application, call the SDK for Android to create a channel ID.</li><li>Register the same channel ID in the OPPO console.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the Tencent Push Notification Service <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meizu</td>
<td>No instructions on channels are provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vivo</td>
<td><ul><li>You can only configure using vivo system messages but cannot customize the notification channel.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the Tencent Push Notification Service <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
3. If you need neither vendor notification messages nor a custom channel ID, Tencent Push Notification Service will specify a default channel ID for all messages of your application and group them into the default type.

## vivo System Message Channel Application Guide

### vivo message classification overview

vivo classifies push messages into operation messages and system messages.

| Message Category | Quota         | Supported Message Content |    How to Increase Quota | Notification Bar Message Display                   | Frequency Control Rule After June 1, 2020            |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Operation message | Number of SDK subscriptions x 2 |  In addition to system messages, you can send notifications of content recommendations, event recommendations, social networking status updates, etc. For details, see [vivo message classification](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/359). |  Contact vivo sales personnel. | Collapsed when the application is not active and displayed when the application is active | Up to 5 messages per application per user per day |
| System message | Number of SDK subscriptions x 2 |<li>Instant message</li><li>Email</li><li>Reminder set by user</li><li>Logistics</li><li>Order</li><li>To-do/To-read</li><li>Finance</li><li>Feature reminder</li>For details, see [message classification scenario description](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/359). | Send an email to apply for quota increase. See below for the application template and requirements.   | Displayed regardless of whether the application is active           | No limit on the number of messages received by users                     |

> ?
>1. Before June 1, 2020, no matter whether the message classification feature is enabled, the frequency control rule remains the same: up to 5 **public messages (full push, group push, tag push)** per application per user per day, and no limit on the number of messages per push. From June 1, 2020 on, the frequency control rule specifies that the upper limit for **operation messages** per application per user is 5, and if any user experience-related complaint arises, the number will be adjusted.
>2. Funtouch OS 10 or later does not provide a message box, and messages are displayed on the narrow bar when the application is not active.
>3. Both the system message quota and operation message quota will automatically change with the number of SDK subscriptions. If special circumstances require an increase in the system message quota, please submit an application as instructed in the next section.
>4. If a vivo user receives more than 5 operational messages a day, the extra messages beyond the limit (5 messages) are delivered through the Tencent Push Notification Service channel, instead of the vivo channel.
>5. If you have applied to vivo to increase the operating message limit, please contact us so that we can configure it on the backend; otherwise, the new limit will not take effect.
>

[](id:vivo_system)
### Applying for vivo system messages

The system message quota is twice the number of SDK subscriptions by default. To increase the quota, send an application email based on the template below to push@vivo.com:
```plaintext
Subject: Application for Increasing the Quota of Instant Messages/System Messages for App XXX
Body: â€¦
Application name: â€¦
Package name: â€¦
Application overview: â€¦
Instant Messages/System message quota required (unit: 10,000): ...

## Huawei Message Classification User Guide

### Huawei message classification overview

Starting from EMUI 10.0, Huawei Push intelligently categorizes notification messages into two levels: "service and communication" and "information and marketing". Versions earlier than EMUI 10.0 don't categorize notification messages and have only one level, where all messages are displayed through the "default notification" channel, which is equivalent to the service and notification category on EMUI 10.0. From January 5, 2023 on, the number of information and marketing messages pushed per day will be capped according to the type of application, while there will be no limit to the number of service and communication messages pushed per day.
Huawei's response code 256 indicates that the number of information and marketing messages sent of the current day exceeds the limit, and you need to adjust the sending policy. For more information, see [here](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/message-restriction-description-0000001361648361?ha_source=hms5).

The table below compares the display style of messages at different levels.

| Message Level | Displayed in the Notification Center | Displayed in the Status Bar | Notification for Screen Lock | Ringtone | Vibration |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Service and communication     | Normal         | Supported           | Supported     | Supported | Supported |
| Information and marketing     | Normal         | Not supported             | Not supported       | Not supported   | Not supported   |

If you want service and notification messages to be sent silently, you can add the `hw_importance` field and specify its value as `1`. For more information, see the parameter description of [Push API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).

Classification rules:

- Intelligent message classification
Intelligent classification algorithms will automatically categorize your messages according to classification criteria based on multiple dimensional factors such as the content you send.
- Self-help message classification
Starting from July 1, 2021, the Huawei Push service will begin to receive developers' applications for self-help message classification. After their applications are approved, developers can classify messages by themselves according to Huawei Push's classification specifications.

### Applying for self-help message classification permission
The self-help classification permission for Huawei notification messages can take effect only after you apply for it. For more information, see [Message Classification Methods](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/message-classification-0000001149358835#section1653845862216).

>!
> - If the application does not provide the self-help message classification feature, its push messages will be automatically classified by intelligent classification.
> - If the application provides the self-help message classification feature, the classification information provided by developers is trusted, and intelligent classification is not implemented for messages.
> 

### Using self-classified messages

Self-classified messages can be delivered only through APIs but not the console. After successfully obtaining the permission for self-help message classification, you can use the feature as follows:

Configure the `hw_category` field in the `Android` request structure of the RESTful API to deliver self-classified messages. For more information, see the parameter description in [Push API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).

Sample push:

```json
{
    "audience_type": "token",
    "token_list": ["005c28bf60e29f9a***2052ce96f43019a0b7"],
    "message_type": "notify",
    "message": {
        "title": "Account logged out:",
        "content": "Your account has been logged out due to login from an unusual login location.",
        "android": {
            "hw_category":"VOIP"
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating a Huawei notification channel

Huawei Push supports customizing notification channels for applications. To create a notification channel on the client, use either of the following methods:

1. Use the Android API to create a notification channel. For more information, see [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/notify-user/channels).
2. Use the Tencent Push Notification Service SDK (version 1.1.5.4 or later). For more information, see [Creating a notification channel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30715) in the API Documentation.

### Using a Huawei notification channel

Currently, notifications pushed through Huawei's custom channel can be delivered only through a RESTful API but not the console. After a notification channel is created, you can:

Configure the `hw_ch_id` field in the Android request structure of the RESTful API to push messages through the Huawei notification channel. For more information, see the parameter description in [Push API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).

>! 
> - If you select China as the data processing location when you apply for the Huawei push service for your application in the Huawei push console, the custom channel feature is no longer applicable to your application. Your push messages will be classified as service and communication messages or information and marketing messages based on the message levels determined by the smart classification system or the self-help message classification permission. For more information, see [Notification Channel Customization](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/android-custom-chan-0000001050040122).
> - The custom channel feature requires the self-help message classification permission for your application. Please apply for it as instructed above.
>

Sample push:

```json
{
    "audience_type": "token",
    "token_list": ["005c28bf60e29f9a***2052ce96f43019a0b7"],
    "message_type": "notify",
    "message": {
        "title": "Huawei notification message",
        "content": "Test content",
        "android": {
            "hw_ch_id": "channel_id of the Huawei notification message"
        }
    }
}
```
