<td>Launched TDMQ for CMQ</td>
<td>TDMQ for CMQ is a distributed message queue service that features a reliable message-based async communication mechanism. It enables message sending/receiving among different applications deployed in a distributed manner (or different components of the same application) and stores the delivered messages in reliable and valid message queues to prevent message loss. It supports multi-process simultaneous read/write, so that message sending and receiving do not interfere with each other, eliminating the need for the applications or components to keep running.</td>
