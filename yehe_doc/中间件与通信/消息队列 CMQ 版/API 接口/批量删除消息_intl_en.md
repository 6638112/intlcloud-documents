## API Description
This API is used to batch delete up to 16 consumed messages. The consumer needs to use the `ReceiptHandle` obtained after the last consumption as a parameter to locate the messages to be deleted.
This operation can be successfully performed only before `NextVisibleTime`. After `NextVisibleTime` elapses, the message will return to the `Active` status, and `ReceiptHandle` will become invalid, making it impossible to delete the message. In this case, the message needs to be consumed again to get a new `ReceiptHandle`. When a message is consumed by multiple consumers concurrently, if the message is deleted by one of the consumers, other consumers can no longer get it.

The public/private domain names for API requests can be copied from **Queue Service** > **API Request Address** in the [TDMQ for CMQ console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/tdmq). A sample address is as follows:
- Public network address: `https://cmq-gz.publicXXX.tencenttdmq.com`
- Private network address: `http://gz.mqadapter.cmq.tencentyun.com`


>!
>- The API call URL varies by region.
>- Whenever downstream traffic is generated from using the public domain name, traffic fees will be charged (even during the beta test period). Therefore, we strongly recommend you use the **private** domain name to avoid traffic fees.
## Input Parameters

The list below contains only the API request parameters. Other parameters can be found in [Common Request Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1111/46459).

| receiptHandle.n | Yes | String | Message handler returned from the last consumption. For ease of use, `n` can start from either 0 or 1, but the values must be consecutive. For example, two messages to be deleted can be represented by `receiptHandle.0,receiptHandle.1` or `receiptHandle.1, receiptHandle.2`. |


## Output Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| code | Int | 0: Success. 4420: The QPS has reached the limit. 4440: The queue does not exist. 6010: Failed to delete some messages. 6020: Failed to delete all messages. For the descriptions of other returned values, see [Common Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1111/46458). |
| message | String | Error message. |
