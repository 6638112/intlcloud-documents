## API Description
This API is used to consume up to 16 messages in a queue.
Calling the `BatchReceiveMessage` API will change the status of the obtained message to `inactive`, and the period of being `inactive` is specified by the `visibilityTimeout` queue attribute (for more information, see [CreateCmqQueue](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api/1110/44169)). We recommend you make the consumer call the `(batch) DeleteMessage` API to delete the message after it successfully consumes the message within the `visibilityTimeout` period; otherwise, the message will return to the `active` status and can be consumed again.

The public/private domain names for API requests can be copied from **Queue Service** > **API Request Address** in the [TDMQ for CMQ console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/tdmq). A sample address is as follows:
- Public network address: `https://cmq-gz.publicXXX.tencenttdmq.com`
- Private network address: `http://gz.mqadapter.cmq.tencentyun.com`


>!
>- The API call URL varies by region.
>- Whenever downstream traffic is generated from using the public domain name, traffic fees will be charged (even during the beta test period). Therefore, we strongly recommend you use the **private** domain name to avoid traffic fees.


## Input Parameters

The list below contains only the API request parameters. Other parameters can be found in [Common Request Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1111/46459).

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| queueName | Yes | String | Queue name, which is unique under the same account in an individual region. It is a string of up to 64 characters, which must begin with a letter and can contain letters, digits, and dashes (`-`). |
| numOfMsg| Yes | Int | Number of messages to be consumed. Value range: 1–16. |
| pollingWaitSeconds | No | Int | Long polling wait time in seconds. Value range: 0–30. If this parameter is not set, the value of the `pollingWaitSeconds` queue attribute will be used by default. |


## Output Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| code | Int | 0: Success. others: Error. For more information, see [Common Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1111/46458). |
| message | String | Error message. |
| requestId | String| Request ID generated by the server, which can be submitted to the backend for troubleshooting when an internal server error occurs. |
| msgInfoList | Array | Message information list. Each element indicates the information of one message. |

**`msgInfoList` is defined as follows:**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| msgBody | String | Body of the consumed message. |
| msgId | String | Unique ID of the consumed message. |
| receiptHandle | String | The unique message handler returned from each consumption, which is used to delete the message. Only the handler generated from the last consumption of a message can be used to delete the message. The validity period is `visibilityTimeout`, i.e., hidden duration of fetched message, after which the handler will become invalid. |
| enqueueTime | Int | Time when consumption is created and enters the queue. A Unix timestamp will be returned which is accurate down to the second. |
| firstDequeueTime | Int | Reserved field. |
| nextVisibleTime | Int | Time when a message is visible next time (i.e., consumable again). A Unix timestamp will be returned which is accurate down to the second. |
| dequeueCount | Int | Reserved field. |
