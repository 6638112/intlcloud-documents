## API Description
This API is used to batch send up to 16 messages to a specified queue.

The public/private domain names for API requests can be copied from **Queue Service** > **API Request Address** in the [TDMQ for CMQ console](https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/tdmq). A sample address is as follows:
- Public network address: `https://cmq-gz.publicXXX.tencenttdmq.com`
- Private network address: `http://gz.mqadapter.cmq.tencentyun.com`


>!
>- The API call URL varies by region.
>- Whenever downstream traffic is generated from using the public domain name, traffic fees will be charged (even during the beta test period). Therefore, we strongly recommend you use the **private** domain name to avoid traffic fees.


## Input Parameters
The list below contains only the API request parameters. Other parameters can be found in [Common Request Parameters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1111/46459).

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| queueName| Yes | String | Queue name, which must be unique under the same account in the same region. It can contain up to 64 letters, digits, and hyphens and must begin with a letter. |
| msgBody.n | Yes | String | Message body, which represents a message in the batch. Currently, a batch can contain up to 16 messages. <br><br>For ease of use, `n` can start from either 0 or 1, but the values must be consecutive. For example, two messages to be sent can be represented by `msgBody.0, msgBody.1` or `msgBody.1, msgBody.2`. <br><br>Note: As the total size of all messages (`msgBody` only, excluding message headers and other parameters) cannot exceed 64 KB, we recommend you plan the number of messages to be sent in advance. |
| delaySeconds | No | Int | This field indicates how many seconds it should take for the messages to be visible after they are sent to the queue (this delay will take effect for a batch of messages, while many-to-many mapping is not supported). |
