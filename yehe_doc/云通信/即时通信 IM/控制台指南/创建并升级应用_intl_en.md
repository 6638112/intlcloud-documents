## Overview
This article describes how to use the IM console to create trial apps and obtain SDKAppIDs. It also describes how to upgrade trial apps to professional apps.

## Prerequisites
[Sign Up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) for a Tencent Cloud account and complete [Identity Verification](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Creating a Trial App
1. Log in to the Tencent Cloud [IM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).
2. Click **Add a new app** to bring up the **Create an app** dialog box.
3. Input a name for your app and click **OK**.
    After the app is created, use the console homepage to view the status, application version, SDKAppID, creation time, and expiration time of the app.
  > By default, a new app is a trial app and enabled.
  > A Tencent Cloud account can have a maximum of 100 IM apps. If you have reached that limit, [disable](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34540) and delete an app before creating a new one. **Once an app is deleted, all data and the services it offered are gone for good, so proceed with caution.**
