### Obtaining a key
**Keys are sensitive information. Keep it confidential and do not leak it.** Apps (SDKAppIDs) created before August 15, 2019 used the [ECDSA-SHA256](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385) signature algorithm by default, which uses a public key and a private key. You can update them to use the HMAC-SHA256 signature algorithm.

1. Click **Display key** next to **Key**.
2. Click **Copy** to copy and store the key information.
    The key can be used to generate UserSig. For more information, refer to [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385).

## Configuring Account Administrators
Account administrators can call RESTful APIs, disband groups, and perform operations on all members. You can use the default account administrator `administrator` or manually add a new account administrator.

## Enabling Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC)
If you need features such as audio calls, video calls, and interactive live broadcasting in your IM app, or need to integrate the IM SDK and TRTC SDK at the same time, enable [TRTC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047) in the **Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC)**. The system will create a TRTC app in the [TRTC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/trtc), which has the same SDKAppID as your current IM app. The two apps use the same account and authentication.

1. Click **Activate** in the **Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC)** area.
