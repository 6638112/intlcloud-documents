## 1. IM SDK Error Codes
> For Web SDK error codes, see [Error Code Table](https://imsdk-1252463788.file.myqcloud.com/IM_DOC/Web/global.html). 

### General error codes

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0 | No error. |
| 6015 | Operation in progress. Optimize the control over API calls. For example, if another initialization operation is performed before the first initialization operation is called back, the system returns this error code. |
| 6017 | A parameter is invalid. Check whether the parameter complies with requirements. For more information, check the error information to locate the specific field. |
| 6022 | Local I/O operation error. Check whether you have the read and write permissions or whether the disk is full. |
| 6027 | Incorrect JSON format. Check whether the parameters meet the requirements of the API. For more information, you can check the error information to locate the specific field. |
| 6028 | Insufficient memory. A memory leak may occur. Analyze and identify the location with high memory usage by using the Instrument tool on the iOS platform or the Profiler tool on the Android platform. |
| 6001 | PB parsing failed due to an internal error. |
| 6002 | PB serialization failed due to an internal error. |
| 6013 | The IM SDK has not been initialized. Try again after the IM SDK is initialized and the response is returned through callback. |
| 6005 | Failed to load the local database, possibly due to file corruption. |
| 6019 | Operation on the local database failed. This error may be caused by a lack of permissions for some directories or file corruption in the database. |
| 7001 | Cross-thread error. Cross-thread operations are not possible. This is an internal error. |
| 7002 | TinyId is empty. This is an internal error. |
| 7003 | Invalid UserID. A UserID cannot be empty and must be printable ASCII characters (0x20-0x7e) containing up to 32 bytes in length. |
| 7004 | The file does not exist. Check whether the file path is correct. |
| 7005 | The file size exceeds the limit. The maximum permitted size of an uploaded file is 28 MB. |
| 7006 | The file is empty. The file cannot be 0 bytes. When uploading an image, audio, video, or document, ensure that the file is generated correctly. |
| 7007 | Failed to open the file. Check whether the file exists or has been opened exclusively, which causes the SDK to fail to open it. |

### Account error codes

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6014 | You have not logged in to the IM SDK or have been forcibly logged out. Log in to the IM SDK first and try again after successful callback. To check whether you are online, use TIMManager getLoginUser. |
| 6026 | This user account was not logged in during auto login. Call the login API to log in to the user account again. |
| 6206 | UserSig has expired. Get a new valid UserSig and log in again. For more information on how to get a UserSig, see [Generating a UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385). |

| 9520 | The request packet has entered the network buffer of the system but timed out when waiting for the server to return packets. This internal error may occur if the request packet did not leave the client device, was discarded in an intermediate route, or is dropped accidentally by the server, or the response packet is discarded by the network layer of the system. |
