## Billing Method
Instant Messaging (IM) is pay-as-you-go on a monthly billing cycle.
- Fees are billed by calendar month. Fees incurred within a calendar month will be deducted on the third day of the next month.


## Basic Services

- **Maximum number of audio-video chat rooms that can be created**: indicates the total number of audio-video chat rooms that can be created by all users in a single SDKAppID. Audio-video chat rooms support only text, image, short audio, and custom messages. Services such as [Live Video Broadcasting](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/267) and [Tencent Real-Time Communication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647) need to be activated separately.
- **Maximum net increase in group quantity per day**: indicates the net total number of groups (of all types) that can be created by all users in a single SDKAppID in a calendar day. The maximum net increase in group quantity per day is 10,000, in which up to 5 online broadcasting chat rooms can be created. If you have reached the group creation threshold of the day but need to create more groups, you can delete the groups that are no longer needed and create new groups. For more information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).
- **DAU**: indicates the number of unique users that log in to IM on a given day. A user that logs in repeatedly on the same day only counts as one DAU.
- **Peak group count**: indicates the total number of groups created and joined by all users under a single app (SDKAppID). Charges are billed according to the peak value in a calendar month.

## Value-added Services
Each value-added service has its own billing method. Value-added services are available only for Pro Edition and Ultimate Edition.
