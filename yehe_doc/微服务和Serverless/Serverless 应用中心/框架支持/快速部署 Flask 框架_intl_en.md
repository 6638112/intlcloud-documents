## Overview


This document describes how to quickly deploy a Flask business to the cloud through an SCF web function.


>?This document mainly describes how to deploy in the console. You can also complete the deployment on the command line. For more information, please see [Deploying Framework on Command Line](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/41586).



## Prerequisites

Before using SCF, you need to sign up for a [Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629) first.


## Directions

### Template deployment - quick deployment of Flask project

1. Log in to the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/index?rid=1) and click **Function Service** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the region where to create a function at the top of the page and click **Create** to enter the function creation process.
3. Select **Template** for **Creation Method**, enter `WebFunc` in the search box to filter all web function templates, select **Flask Framework Template**, and click **Next** as shown below:

4. On the **Configuration** page, you can view and modify the specific configuration information of the template project.
5. Click **Complete**. After creating the web function, you can view its basic information on the **Function Management** page.
6. You can access the deployed Flask project at the access path URL generated by API Gateway. Click **Trigger Management** on the left to view the access path as shown below:

7. Click the access path URL to access the Flask project.



### Custom deployment - quick migration of local project to cloud

#### Local development

1. Run the following command to confirm that Flask has been installed in your local environment.
```shell
pip install Flask
```
2. Create the `Hello World` sample project locally.
In the project directory, create the `app.py` file to implement the Hello World application. Below is the sample code:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
   return 'Hello World'

if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run()
:::
</dx-codeblock>
3. Run the `python3 app.py` command locally to start the `app.py` file. Below is the sample code:
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
$ python3 app.py
 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: Do not use the development server in a production environment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
127.0.0.1 - - [22/Jun/2021 09:41:04] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
:::
</dx-codeblock>
4. Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in a browser, and you can access the sample Flask project locally as shown below:

#### Deployment in cloud

Next, perform the following steps to make simple modifications to the locally created project, so that it can be quickly deployed through a web function. The steps of project transformation for Flask are as follows:


1. **Install dependencies**
 1. As the Flask dependency library is not provided in the standard cloud environment of SCF, you must install the dependencies and upload them together with the project code. Please create the `requirements.txt` file first with the following content:
```txt
#requirements.txt
Flask==1.0.2
werkzeug==0.16.0
```
 2. Run the following command to install:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. **Modify the listening address and port**
The listening port in the web function must be **9000**, so you need to change the listening address and port to `0.0.0.0:9000` as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ea0a28fae8c9ab16dbe447bfe883aafe.png)
>?You can also configure the listening port through the environment variable in `scf_bootstrap`.
3. **Add the `scf_bootstrap` bootstrap file**
 1. Create the `scf_bootstrap` bootstrap file in the project root directory and add the following content to it (which is used to configure environment variables, specify service bootstrap commands, and make sure that your service can be started normally through this file):
```
#!/bin/bash
/var/lang/python3/bin/python3 app.py
```
 2. After the creation is completed, you need to run the following command to modify the executable permission of the file. By default, the permission `777` or `755` is required for it to start normally. Below is the sample code:
```shell
chmod 777 scf_bootstrap
```
>!
>- In the SCF environment, only files in the `/tmp` directory are readable/writable. We recommend you select `/tmp` when outputting files. If you select other directories, write will fail due to the lack of permissions.
>- If you want to output environment variables in the log, you need to add the `-u` parameter before the bootstrap command, such as `python -u app.py`.

4. After the local configuration is completed, run the following command to start the service (with execution in the `scf_bootstrap` directory as an example) and make sure that your service can be normally started locally.
<dx-codeblock>
:::  shell
./scf_bootstrap
:::
</dx-codeblock>
5. Log in to the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/index?rid=1) and click **Function Service** on the left sidebar.
6. Select the region where to create a function at the top of the page and click **Create** to enter the function creation process.
7. Select **Custom Creation** for **Creation Method** and configure the options as prompted as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/10dce3203472b93e65e66119e47135d8.png)
	- **Function Type**: select **Web function**.
	- **Function Name**: enter the name of your function.
	- **Region**: enter your function deployment region, such as Chengdu.
	- **Deployment Method**: select **Code deployment** and upload your local project.
	- **Runtime Environment**: select **Python 3.6**.
8. Click **Complete**.






#### Development management
After the deployment is completed, you can quickly access and test your web service in the SCF console and try out various features of SCF, such as layer binding and log management. In this way, you can enjoy the advantages of low cost and flexible scaling brought by the serverless architecture.
