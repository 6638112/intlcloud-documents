The SLS framework deployment scheme has been upgraded. You can use an SCF HTTP-triggered function to quickly deploy your Express service to the cloud.

>! **What are the differences between SLS console deployment and direct function deployment?**
Both SLS console deployment and function deployment can be based on HTTP-triggered functions, and quick deployment is usually used for web frameworks.
- If you only need to develop code logic and do not need to create additional resources, you can perform quick deployment through the SCF console.
- If you need to create more capabilities or resources, such as automatic creation of layer hosting dependencies, quick implementation of static resource isolation, and support for direct code repository pulling, in addition to code deployment, you can use the SLS console to create web applications.

This document introduces the SLS console deployment scheme. You can also complete the deployment in CLI by referring to [Deploying Web Function on Command Line](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/41376).

## Template Deployment - Deploying Express Sample Code
1. Log in to the [SLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sls).
2. Choose **Create Application** and select **Web Application** > **Express Framework**.
3. Click **Next** and complete basic configuration.
4. Select **Sample Code** as the upload mode and click **Complete**. The application deployment starts.
5. After the application deployment is completed, you can view the basic information of the sample application on the application details page. In addition, you can use access the deployed Express project at the access path URL generated by API Gateway.

## Custom Deployment - Quickly Deploying Web Application
### Prerequisites

The Node.js runtime environment has been installed locally.

### Local development
1. After confirming that the Node.js runtime environment has been installed locally, install the Express framework and express-generator tool and initialize your sample Express project.
```shell
npm install express --save
npm install express-generator --save
express WebApp
```

2. Go to the project directory and install the dependency package.
```
cd WebApp
npm install
```

3. After the installation is completed, you can directly start the service locally. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in a browser, and you can access the sample Express project locally.
```
npm start
```

### Deployment in cloud

Next, perform the following steps to make simple modifications to the initialized project, so that it can be quickly deployed through an HTTP-triggered function. The project transformation here is usually divided into the following two steps:

- Change the listening address and port to `0.0.0.0:9000`.
- Add the `scf_bootstrap` file.

The detailed steps are as follows:
1. In the sample Express project, you can specify the listening address and port through the environment variable in the `./bin/www` file. If you don't specify it, port 3000 will be listened on by default.

2. Create the `scf_bootstrap` file in the root directory of the project. This file is used to configure environment variables and specify service start commands.
 >? You can also complete the configuration in the console.

```shell
#!/bin/bash
export PORT=9000
npm run start
```
After the file is created, you need to run the following command to modify the executable permission of the file. By default, the permission `777` or `755` is required for the service to start normally.
```
chmod 777 scf_bootstrap
```
3. After the local configuration is completed, run the bootstrap file and make sure that your service can be normally started locally. Then log in to the [SLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sls), select **Web Application** > **Express Framework**, and select ***Local Upload** or **Code Repository Pull** as the upload mode.

You can configure the `scf_bootstrap` file in the console. When the configuration is completed, the console automatically generates the `scf_bootstrap` file and packages it and the project code for deployment.
>! The actual `scf_bootstrap` file in your project prevails. If the `scf_bootstrap` file already exists in your project, its content will not be overwritten.

When the configuration is completed, click **Complete** to deploy your Express project.
