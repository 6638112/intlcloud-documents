## Overview
* Welcome to Tencent Cloud Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.0, a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. SDK 3.0 is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
* This document describes how to use, debug, and connect to TencentCloud APIs with the SDK for Python 3.0 as an example.
* This version currently supports various Tencent Cloud products such as CVM, VPC, and CBS and will support more products in the future.

## Dependent Environment

* Python 2.7 and 3.6–3.9.
* Get the security credential, which consists of `SecretId` and `SecretKey`. `SecretId` is used to identify the API requester, while `SecretKey` is a key used for signature string encryption and authentication by the server. You can get them on the [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/53199c4c8465fb2c13a26fe18e42e63b.png)
>!**Your security credential represents your account identity and granted permissions, which is equivalent to your login password. Do not disclose it to others.**
* Get the calling address (endpoint), which is generally in the format of `*.tencentcloudapi.com` and varies by product. For example, the endpoint of CVM is `cvm.tencentcloudapi.com`. For specific endpoints, please see the [API documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api) of the corresponding product .



## Installing SDK
### Method 1. Install through pip (recommended)
You can install the Tencent Cloud SDK for Python into your project through pip. If you haven't installed pip in your project environment yet, install it first as instructed at [pip official website](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/?spm=a3c0i.o32026zh.a3.6.74134958lLSo6o).
Run the following command on the command line to install the SDK for Python.

```python
pip install tencentcloud-sdk-python
```
>! If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 environments, you need to use the pip3 command to install.

If you are in the Chinese mainland, you can use a Tencent Cloud mirror source to speed up the download. If you only use sources in the Chinese mainland, you can add the `-i` parameter for specifying. Below is the sample code:
```python
# Take a Tencent source as an example 
# The source address is followed by the package to be installed: tencentcloud-sdk-python
pip install -i https://mirrors.tencent.com/pypi/simple/ --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python
```

>?
>- If you only want to use the package of a specific product, such as CVM, you can install it separately, but this method cannot work together with the full installation method. For example, run `pip install --upgrade tencentcloud-sdk-python-common tencentcloud-sdk-python-cvm`.

### Method 2. Install through source package
Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-python) to download the latest code, decompress it, and run the following command:

    $ cd tencentcloud-sdk-python
    $ python setup.py install

## Using SDK
The following takes the instance list querying API as an example.

::: Simplified Python
```python
from tencentcloud.common import credential
from tencentcloud.common.exception.tencent_cloud_sdk_exception import TencentCloudSDKException
from tencentcloud.cvm.v20170312 import cvm_client, models

try:
     cred = credential.Credential("secretId", "secretKey")
     client = cvm_client.CvmClient(cred, "ap-shanghai")

    req = models.DescribeInstancesRequest()
     resp = client.DescribeInstances(req)

    print(resp.to_json_string())
except TencentCloudSDKException as err:
     print(err)
```

     httpProfile.protocol = "https"  # HTTP is supported if the network environment has access to the public network, and HTTPS is used by default and recommended

## More Samples
You can find more detailed samples in the `examples` directory in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-python).

## Relevant Configuration

### Proxy

If there is a proxy in your environment, you can set the proxy in the following two ways:

- Specify the proxy when initializing HttpProfile. For more information, please see the [example](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-python/blob/master/examples/cvm/v20170312/describe_zones.py).
- You need to set the system environment variable `https_proxy`.

Otherwise, it may not be called normally, and a connection timeout exception will be thrown.

## FAQs
### Certificate issue

When you install Python 3.6 or above on macOS, you may encounter a certificate error: `Error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1056).`.

This is because that on macOS, Python no longer uses the system's default certificate and does not provide a certificate itself. When an HTTPS request is made, the certificate provided by the `certifi` library needs to be used, but the SDK does not support specifying it; therefore, you can only solve this problem by installing the certificate with the `sudo "/Applications/Python 3.6/Install Certificates.command"` command.

Although this problem should not occur in Python 2, there may be similar situations in specific user environments, which can also be solved with `sudo /Applications/Python 2.7/Install Certificates.command`.
