Tencent Cloud Monitor provides the following monitoring metrics for SCF:

Currently, two levels of monitoring metrics are supported. Monitoring metrics at the function level can be viewed in specific functions, while those at the region level can be viewed by selecting a specific region on the overview page to display the statistics of all function monitoring metrics.

| Metric Name | Parameter | Description | Unit | Dimension |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- | -------------- |
| Execution duration | duration | The execution duration at the function or region level refers to the function code execution time from start to end, averaged by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | Milliseconds | Function <br>Region |
| Number of invocations | invocation | The number of requests at the function or region level, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function <br>Region |
| Number of errors | error | The number of error requests after the function is executed, which currently includes those on the client side and on the platform, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function <br>Region |
| Number of concurrent executions | concurrent_executions | The number of requests processed concurrently at the same time point, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes) and determined by the maximum value at the function or region level. | - | Function <br>Region |
| Number of restricted requests | throttle | The number of requests that reaches the bandwidth limit at the function or region level, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function <br>Region |
| Execution memory | mem | The actual memory used by the function runtime, whose maximum value is calculated by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | MB | Function |
| Time memory | mem_duration | Resource usage, which is calculated by multiplying the function execution duration by the execution memory, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | MBms | Function |
| Outbound traffic | out_flow | The outbound traffic generated by accessing resources on the public network from a function, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | KB | Function |
| System internal error (HTTP 5xx) | syserr | The number of 5xx status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
| Function error (HTTP 4xx) | http_4xx | The number of 4xx status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
| Successful invocations (HTTP 2xx) | http_2xx | The number of 2xx status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
| Resource limit exceeded (HTTP 432) | http_432 | The number of 432 status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
| Function execution timed out (HTTP 433) | http_433 | The number of 433 status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
| Memory limit exceeded (HTTP 434) | http_434 | The number of 434 status codes returned after function execution, summed by granularity (1 minute or 5 minutes). | - | Function |
