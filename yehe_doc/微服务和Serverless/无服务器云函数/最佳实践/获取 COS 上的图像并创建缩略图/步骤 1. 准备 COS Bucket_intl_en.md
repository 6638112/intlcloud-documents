>1. The source and target buckets must be in the same region as the function. In this tutorial, the Guangzhou region is used.

1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login) and select **Cloud Object Storage**.
2. Click **Create Bucket** in the **Bucket List** tab to create a source COS bucket.
3. Set the name of the COS bucket as `mybucket`, select `Guangzhou` as the region, set the access permission to the default value of `private read and write`, and click **OK**.
4. Create the target bucket `mybucket-resized` in the same way.
