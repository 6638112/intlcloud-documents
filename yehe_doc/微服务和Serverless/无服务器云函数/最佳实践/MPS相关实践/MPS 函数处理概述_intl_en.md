Through the function processing service, you can quickly process and operate on the callback events generated by [MPS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1041). Events are pushed to SCF through an [MPS trigger](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39163), and then callback event processing and response are implemented through function computation of Serverless Framework.
The overall data processing flow is as shown below:

## Function Processing Practices

CLS can send data in a log topic to SCF for processing through an [MPS trigger](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39163) to satisfy the needs of various use cases, such as video event notification, status monitoring, and alarm processing as detailed below:


| Function Processing Scenario | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| [Video task callback backup to COS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39165) | Backs up task callbacks generated by MPS to COS through SCF promptly |
| [Video task callback notification tool](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39166) | Receives MPS data messages in real time and pushes them through WeCom, email, etc. |


>! Data is delivered to SCF, which incurs corresponding computation fees. For billing details, please see SCF [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/17299).
