This document describes how to quickly create an event-triggered function in the console.
Compared with event-triggered functions, the HTTP-triggered functions provided by SCF focus more on optimizing web services. Click [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/40689) to understand and quickly create an HTTP-triggered function.


## Step 1. Sign up for a Tencent Cloud Account

If you already have a Tencent Cloud account, ignore this step.

<div style="background-color:#00A4FF; width: 170px; height: 35px; line-height:35px; text-align:center;"><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register" target="_blank"  style="color: white; font-size:13px;">Click here to sign up for a Tencent Cloud account</a></div>

## Step 2. Topping Up Online

SCF users are entitled to a certain free tier of resource usage and invocations each month as shown below. There is no free tier for public network outbound traffic. SCF is billed by the actual Tencent Cloud resource usage. If you need to use other postpaid Tencent Cloud resources, top up your account first as instructed in [Payment Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/555/7425) before making purchases.



## Step 3. Authorizing TKE

Log in to the [Tencent Cloud console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), select **Products** > **Serverless Cloud Function** to enter the SCF console, and follow the prompts to authorize SCF. (If you have already authorized SCF, skip this step.)

<div style="background-color:#00A4FF; width: 150px; height: 35px; line-height:35px; text-align:center;"><a href="https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/scf/index?rid=1" target="_blank"  style="color: white; font-size:13px;">Click here to authorize TKE</a></div>



## Step 4. Create a function

<div style="background-color:#00A4FF; width: 170px; height: 35px; line-height:35px; text-align:center;"><a href="https://console.intl.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list-create?rid=1&ns=default" target="_blank"  style="color: white; font-size:13px;">Click here to enter the function creation page</a></div>

1. Click **Function Service** on the left sidebar to enter the **Function Service** page.
2. Select **Guangzhou** at the top of the page and click **Create** as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/718294ab42e0352407f5675ed50ade95.png)
3. Enter the basic information of the function on the **Create Function** page and click **Next** as shown below: 
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/16bb5ab1368b418d67a07db7b5d142d0.png)
 - **Create Method**: select **Function Template**.
 - **Filter**: after entering `helloworld`, press "Enter" to search for and select the `helloworld` template. SCF supports multiple runtime environments. This function uses Python 2.7 as an example.
4. The function name is automatically generated by default and can be modified as needed. Keep the default function configuration and click **Complete** as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/1f97c60e8cffc2b089d41c187d7b4609.png)
After the function is created, you will be automatically redirected to the "Function Configuration" page where you can view the configuration information.
5. Select the **Function code** tab to view or edit the function code online as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/80b6fbaccc151814b4fdfd9012929b3a.png)




## Step 5. Deploy the function (including trigger configuration)
1. After editing the function code online, click **Deploy**, and the function will be deployed.
2. On the details page of the created function, select **Trigger Management** on the left and click **Create a Trigger**.
3. In the **Create a Trigger** window that pops up, set **Trigger Method** to **API Gateway Trigger**, unselect **Enable integration response**, and keep other parameters as default as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3fd656b836b6892cea8aecff6feb5594.png)
4. Click **Submit** to complete the function deployment and trigger configuration.

## Step 6. Test in the cloud
<dx-tabs>
::: Function\sdeployment\stest
On the **Function Management** page, select **Function code** and click **Test** to run the code with the test result returned as shown below:

<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
- If you need to replace the test template or its content, you can directly edit the function content or select **Current Test Template**, replace it, and then click **Save**.
- Different test templates simulate different trigger message sources, and the messages passed between different triggers and SCF are data structures agreed upon in advance. For more information, please see [Trigger Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/9705).
</dx-alert>

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3758f32893e46b38d94d25cb71666542.png)
The following information will appear:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/7d5c5d7fc1b7b79f37861df7b3b8d1eb.png)
During this test, SCF will get the data structure of the "Hello world event template" in the `event` parameter of `main_handler`.

```
{
  "key1": "test value 1",
  "key2": "test value 2"
}
```

:::
::: Trigger\sconfiguration\stest
On the **Trigger Management** page, view the trigger details.
1. After a trigger is successfully created, an access path will be generated on the **Trigger Method** page of the function as shown below:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/1f97c60e8cffc2b089d41c187d7b4609.png)
2. If "hello from scf" is displayed when you open the access path in a browser, the function is successfully deployed.

:::
::: View\smonitoring\sdata
On the **Function Management** page, select **Monitoring information** of the created function to view metrics such as function invocations and execution duration as shown below:

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
The minimal granularity of monitoring statistics collection is 1 minute. You need to wait for 1 minute before you can view the current monitoring record.

</dx-alert>
