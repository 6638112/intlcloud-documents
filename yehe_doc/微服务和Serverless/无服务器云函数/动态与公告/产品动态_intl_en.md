<td>Added support for processing multiple concurrent requests by a single instance for HTTP-triggered functions</td>
<td>In web applications, typical business scenarios are I/O-intensive, and access to downstream services such as database or other system APIs in the function takes a long time to wait for the downstream services to respond. Generally, such waits are iowait and don't consume the CPU resources. In this case, if the multiple concurrent requests feature is enabled, one instance can process multiple requests to better utilize the CPU resources of the single instance.</td><td>2022-04-28</td><td>
