### Why are fees billed within the free tier?

Check whether the billable item is response traffic. SCF free tier and resource package don't cover the respond traffic of HTTP-triggered functions. For more information, see [Free Tier](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/12282) and [HTTP-Triggered Function Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/45902).

### Why are public network outbound traffic fees incurred only in this month when the function is executing for a long time without update?

- You can view the public network outbound traffic statistics through the SCF monitoring data.
- The payment will be deducted from the account as long as the aggregate amount reaches two decimal places.
