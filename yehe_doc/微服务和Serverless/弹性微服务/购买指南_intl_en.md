TEM is currently in the beta period (August 17 to July 18,2022). You can log in to the [TEM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tem) to experience it free of charge during beta. You need to pay for other Tencent Cloud services you select such as [CFS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/9553) though.

After the beta test, this product will be commercially available. We will announce its formal launch. If its price changes, we will notify users in advance. For more information of the product, please [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1094/40350).
