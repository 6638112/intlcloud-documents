## Overview
This document describes how to grant an existing TEM permission policy to a sub-account through CAM.
If you have completed authorization in CAM when creating a policy, you can directly grant the policy to other users/user groups in the CAM console. If the policy generated in CAM is deleted or cannot be found, generate the corresponding CAM policy and grant it as follows:

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TEM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tem/overview?ns=) and click **Permission management** on the left sidebar.
2. In the permission policy list, select the target policy and click **Generate CAM policy**.

3. In the CAM console, create a policy, click **Complete**, and **associate the policy to the target users/user groups**.
