## Overview
Events generated by your own applications are custom events. You can deliver custom events in either of the following ways:
- **Using event connectors**: A connector is mainly used to proactively pull events from event sources such as the message queue service and gateways and push them to a custom event bus in **standard format**. You can bind one or more connectors in the custom event bus to automatically pull event content from message queues and gateways and push the content to the specified custom event bus.
