>! All OPS events, such as alerts and auditing events, generated by Tencent Cloud services are delivered to the Tencent Cloud service event bus, which is the default event bus and cannot be modified or deleted. You can go to the EventBridge console to bind rules and targets to the Tencent Cloud service event bus.

## Tencent Cloud Service Event Overview
Tencent Cloud service events include [**Cloud Monitor events**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46252) (such as CVM kernel faults and OOM exceptions) and **CloudAudit events** (available soon) that are generated by Tencent Cloud services. The event content to deliver varies depending on the event type:
