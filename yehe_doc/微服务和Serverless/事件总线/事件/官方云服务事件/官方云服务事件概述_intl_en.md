>! All Ops events such as alarms and auditing events generated by Tencent Cloud services will be delivered to the Tencent Cloud service event bus, which is the default event bus and cannot be modified or deleted. You can go to the EventBridge console to bind rules and targets to the Tencent Cloud service event bus to distribute Tencent Cloud service events.

## Tencent Cloud Service Event Overview
Tencent Cloud service events include [**Cloud Monitor events**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46252) (such as CVM kernel faults and OOM exceptions) and **CloudAudit events** (available soon) that are generated by Tencent Cloud services.
