An event is a data record of a status change. This document describes the details of event parameters in EventBridge.

Event release from an event source to EventBridge needs to comply with CloudEvents specifications. For more information, please see [CloudEvents - Version 1.0](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md?spm=a2c4g.11186623.2.2.749c6781ZcKk8R&file=spec.md).

Below is a sample structure of event release from an event source to EventBridge:


<dx-codeblock>
:::  json
{
   "specversion":"1.0",
   "id":"13a3f42d-7258-4ada-da6d-023a333b4662",
   "type":"cos:created:object",
   "source":"cos.cloud.tencent",
   "subject":"qcs::cos:ap-guangzhou:uid1250000000:bucketname",
   "time":"1615430559146",
   "region":"ap-guangzhou",
   "datacontenttype": "application/json;charset=utf-8",
   "data":{
      $data_value
   }
}

There are two types of events published from event sources to EventBridge:

- **Tencent Cloud service event**
  Tencent Cloud services are automatically connected to EventBridge as event sources.
- **Custom application event**
  To use your application as an event source, you need to configure a connector and deliver events to applications supported by the connector, or use an API/SDK to connect to EventBridge.
