## Automated Ops
EventBridge can be used as a hub to receive status changes of all applications. Auditing events or monitoring alarm events generated for API calls can be quickly delivered to EventBridge, and then EventBridge routes the events to the services that need to perceive the application status changes respectively for message push and automated processing.
