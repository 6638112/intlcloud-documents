## General Trigger


EventBridge is an independent serverless service, which enables you to stay up to date with the real-time data changes in Tencent Cloud services, your applications, and SaaS applications with no need to write code. It is widely used in event-driven architectures (EDAs) to implement inter-application communication through event-triggered services.

## Status Change Notification
EventBridge can be used as a hub to receive status changes of all applications and route them to the services that need to perceive them respectively. You can use it to monitor and receive alarms for any exception, change, and update instead of constantly checking resources such as bucket, database table, serverless feature, and compute node.

## Streaming Data Channel
A core capability of EventBridge is to act as a channel for streaming data. Through CloudEvents specifications and the schema registry (coming soon), it describes streaming data in a unified manner and provides basic filtering and conversion capabilities to route data between different data warehouses, data processing programs, and data analysis and processing systems, so as to connect different systems and services.
