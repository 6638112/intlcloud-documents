## Tencent Cloud EventBridge Overview
Tencent Cloud EventBridge (EventBridge) is a secure, stable, and efficient serverless event management platform. EventBridge can receive real-time events and relevant data streams from your applications, SaaS services, and Tencent Cloud services and route them to other Tencent Cloud service targets such as SCF or TDMQ. In addition, it supports processing and filtering custom events. You can set event rules and customize event match conditions and filter logic. When event data matching the event pattern defined in a rule is received, EventBridge will send the event to one or multiple targets defined in the rule.

## Concepts
Before using EventBridge, you need to understand the following concepts:
- Event: it is a data record of a status change.
- Event source: it is a source that produces an event.
- Event bus: it is an event receiver that stores an event.
- Event rule: it is used to monitor events of the specified types. When a matched event occurs, it will be routed to the event target associated with the corresponding event rule.
- Event target: it is an event processing terminal that consumes events.


## Service Architecture

- Event source: it publishes event messages generated by Tencent Cloud services, custom applications, and SaaS applications to the specified event buses.
- EventBridge: it stores received event messages and routes them to the event targets specified in the corresponding event rules.
- Event target: it consumes event messages.
