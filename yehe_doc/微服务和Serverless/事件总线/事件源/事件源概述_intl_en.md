An event source publishes produced events to EventBridge.

EventBridge supports the following event source connection methods:



#### Tencent Cloud service

If you want to connect a Tencent Cloud service as an event source, you just need to activate the target Tencent Cloud service, and it will be automatically connected to EventBridge. By configuring the predefined event pattern and target, you can publish events to the Tencent Cloud service event bus, use the event pattern to filter events, and route them to the event target with ease.

#### Custom application

If you want to connect a custom business as an event source, you need to configure your application for connection to EventBridge through the corresponding API/SDK. By creating a custom event bus and configuring a custom event pattern and event target, you can publish events generated by your application to the custom event bus, use the custom event pattern to filter them, and route them to the custom event target.

#### Connector

A connector is mainly used to actively pull events from event sources and push them to EventBridge. With it, you don't need to care about the underlying consumer delivery logic and can use the pushed events more easily. You can centrally bind events to a connector to automatically pull event content from message queues and gateways and push the content to the specified event bus.
