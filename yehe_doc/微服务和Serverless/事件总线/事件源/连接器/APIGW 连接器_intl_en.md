## Overview

You can configure API Gateway to process events delivered through webhook so as to use a third-party webhook to receive events generated by other systems. An API Gateway connector is an ideal cross-terminal event receiving connector in HTTP scenarios.

An API Gateway connector is implemented in the **push pattern**. API Gateway monitors requests, generates the corresponding call events, delivers them to the event bus, and routes them to relevant services through event rules.



## Prerequisites

You have [created an event bus](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42285).



## Directions


1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb/) and select **Event Bus** on the left sidebar.
2. In the **Event Bus** list, select the event bus for which you want to configure an API Gateway connector.
3. Click **Add** in the connector configuration section on the **Event Bus Details** page 
4. Enter the relevant information 
	 Here, select **API Gateway** for **Connector Type**.
5. Click **OK**.
6. Select **Event Rule** on the left sidebar.
7. In the drop-down lists at the top of the **Event Rule** page, select the same connector information as that set during connector creation and click **Create Event Rule** 
8. Enter the relevant information as prompted 
	 Here, select **API Gateway** for **Tencent Cloud Service Type** and configure the event target.
9. Click **OK**.
