## Overview 


You can configure a CKafka connector to consume content in CKafka message queues. A CKafka connector is implemented in the **pull pattern**. It automatically pulls CKafka content and routes events to relevant services through event rules. This document describes how to create a CKafka connector and the structure of events generated by the CKafka connector.


## Prerequisites

You have [created an event bus](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42281).



## Directions


1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb/) and select **Event Bus** on the left sidebar.
2. In the **Event Bus** list, select the event bus for which you want to configure a CKafka connector.
3. On the **Event Bus Details** page, click **Add** in the connector configuration section.

5. Click **OK**.
6. Select **Event Rule** on the left sidebar.
7. In the drop-down lists at the top of the **Event Rule** page, select the same connector information as that set during connector creation and click **Create Event Rule** as shown below:
