Event rule is one of the most basic resource units in EventBridge. You can configure an event bus to receive events from an event source and use event rules to filter events. This document describes how to create an event rule in the EventBridge console.

## Prerequisites

You have [created an event bus](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42285).


## Directions

1. Log in to the EventBridge console and select **[Event Rule](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb/rule)** on the left sidebar.
2. At the top of the **Event Rule** list page, select the event bus and region for the event rule to be created.

    - **Event matching**: Used for event filtering. You can specify what events can be matched. You can configure a custom event matching pattern or select an existing template rule. As shown in the figure above, all events from the TDMQ message queue can be matched. For more information about event pattern rules, see [Event Pattern](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42288).
    - **Delivery target**: Specifies the target that is eventually triggered by events.
4. Click to expand **Test Event Matching**. Then you can test the defined event pattern. **Template** is preset with all currently supported templates for events generated by Tencent Cloud services and templates for events generated by connectors.
