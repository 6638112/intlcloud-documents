Each event bus has several event rules. Event rules are the core feature of EventBridge and implement capabilities such as event triggering, filtering, and extraction. You can specify several event targets for each event rule. When an event hits an event rule, the event will be pushed to the specified event target. Event rule related features and operations are as follows:


- The filter feature in an event rule is provided by the event pattern. For more information, please see [Event Pattern](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42288).
- The target triggering feature in an event rule is provided by the event target.
- You can view, modify, or delete an event rule. For more information, see [Managing Event Rule](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42290).
