An event bus receives events from event sources and can be used normally after being bound to a specific event rule. This document describes the types of event buses.



The types of event buses in EventBridge include:

- Tencent Cloud service event bus: It is the default event bus created in **Guangzhou** region. [Cloud Monitor events](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46252) and [CloudAudit events](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46246) generated by Tencent Cloud services will be automatically published to this event bus. You cannot manually create or delete it.
- Custom event bus: It is an event bus that you create and manage by yourself and is used to receive events from your applications. Events of your applications can be published only to custom buses.

To ensure the observability of each event delivery linkage, you can enable the [linkage tracing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46990) feature when creating an event bus.
