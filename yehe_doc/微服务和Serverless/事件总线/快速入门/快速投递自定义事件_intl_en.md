## Overview
In addition to Cloud Monitor and CloudAudit events generated by official Tencent Cloud services, events generated by your own applications can only be published to custom event buses. You can [create custom event buses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42285) and [configure event connectors](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42277) to deliver custom events. Alternatively, you can use an API/SDK to deliver custom events. This document describes how to deliver custom events via an **event connector**.
>? In addition to using an event connector, you can call an API to deliver custom events.

## Delivering Custom Events
### 1. Create a custom event bus

1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb) and click **Create Event Bus**.

2. Enter the event bus name and description.

3. Click **OK**.

### 2. Create an event connector
1. On the **Event Bus** page, click the name of the custom event bus to enter the event bus details page.

2. On the event bus details page, click **Add** in the **Event connector** area.

3. Enter information as instructed. (This example takes a CKafka event connector as an example.)
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/11620e56a0688d03befb7a999db5b811.png)
Set **Connector type** to **CMQ (Kafka)**, set other parameters as needed, and click **OK**. For how to configure other types of connectors, see [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42277).

After the configuration is completed, the event connector can pull a message from CKafka, generate an event based on the message content, and deliver the event to the event bus. Taking the message "Hello from Ckafka again!" as an example, the event connector generates the following event:
```json
 {       
        "specversion":"1.0",       
        "id":"13a3f42d-7258-4ada-da6d-023a333b4662",
        "type":"connector:kafka",   
        "source":"ckafka.cloud.tencent",   
        "subject": "qcs::ckafka:ap-guangzhou:uin/1250000000:ckafkaId/uin/1250000000/ckafka-123456",     
        "time":"1615430559146",   
        "region":"ap-guangzhou",       
        "datacontenttype":"application/json;charset=utf-8",   
        "data":{             
             "topic":"test-topic",         
             "Partition":1,         
             "offset":37,         
             "msgKey":"test",         
             "msgBody":"Hello from Ckafka again!"      
           }
}
```

For more information about the event format, see [Event Structure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42275).

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
Currently, only delivery for Tencent Cloud CKafka instances is supported. Please confirm that no username and password have been configured for your CKafka instances; otherwise, the connector may fail to get messages.

### 3. Create an event rule
1. Select **Event Rule** on the left sidebar.
2. At the top of the **Event Rule** page, select the created event bus from the **Event Bus** drop-down list and click **Create Event Rule**.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/bcfda9e8a96d2df23d710f9a074e3dbc.png)
3. Enter information as instructed.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/9ab5ef4e6b575c7798c022acb9b26e16.png)
This event pattern means to receive all messages that are from CKafka and in `target-topic`. For how to create an event pattern, see [Event Pattern](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42288).
4. Click **Next** to configure the event target, which can be [SCF](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46254) or [CKafka](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46249). Here takes SCF as an example. Event content will be delivered to SCF as parameters.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/d3c06d68ad6a34becdb34fbc0a3a26ac.png)
The `test` function here is to print the events received, and you can write your function based on the actual business scenario. Alternatively, you can quickly deliver events to CKafka or a downstream SaaS service through a template function provided by the platform. For more information, see [SCF Target Delivery](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/46254).

### 4. Check the event
After sending the message to `target-topic`, you can view the following information in the corresponding SCF log page:

```json
START RequestId:79e6d53e-7a98-11ec-8f0d-******4284e2
Received event: {
  "data": {
    "Partition": 1,
    "msgBody": "Hello from Ckafka again!",
    "msgKey": "test",
    "offset": 37,
    "topic": "target-topic"
  },
  "datacontenttype": "application/json;charset=utf-8",
  "id": "13a3f42d-7258-4ada-da6d-******3b4662",
  "region": "ap-guangzhou",
  "source": "ckafka.cloud.tencent",
  "specversion": "0",
  "status": "",
  "subject": "qcs::ckafka:ap-guangzhou:uin/1250000000:ckafkaId/uin/1250000000/ckafka-123456",
  "tags": null,
  "time": 1615430559146,
  "type": "connector:kafka"
}
```
