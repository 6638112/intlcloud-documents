## Overview
After EventBridge is activated, it will automatically create a **default Tencent Cloud service event bus** in the **Guangzhou** region, to which all alarm events generated by services connected to it will be automatically delivered. You can also set event rules and delivery targets to configure an alarm link.

## Instructions
1. The alarm push feature was officially launched on October 15, 2021.
2. The Event Center feature of CM had been gradually deactivated since November 30, 2021 and will be replaced by EventBridge. In addition to the original features, new features such as rule match, custom event bus, and multi-target delivery have been added. To ensure that your event features can be used normally, starting from November 1, 2021, you should activate EventBridge and migrate original capabilities to it. To facilitate migration, we provide the [quick migration](#1) service free of charge.

## Alarm Configuration Steps
### 1. View the event list

1. Log in to the [EventBridge console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/eb) and choose **Tencent Cloud service event bus** > **default** to view the Tencent Cloud service events that are currently connected to the Tencent Cloud service event bus.

#### Sample
Taking a "ping unreachable" event generated by CVM as an example, the standard format for delivering the event to the Tencent Cloud service event bus is as follows:
```json
{
    "specversion":"1.0",
    "id":"13a3f42d-7258-4ada-da6d-023a333b4662",
    "source":"${ProductName}.cloud.tencent",
    "type":"cvm:ErrorEvent:ping_unreachable",
    "subject":"${six-segment service description in CAM}",
    "time": 1615430559146,
    "region":"ap-guangzhou",
    "resource":[
        "qcs::eb:ap-guangzhou:uid1250000000:eventbusid/eventruleid"
    ],
    "datacontenttype":"application/json;charset=utf-8",
    "tags":{
        "key1":"value1",
        "key2":"value2"
     },
    "status":"1",
    "data":{
        "appId":"1250000011",
        "instanceId":"ins-xxxxxxx",
        "projectId":"11",
        "dimensions":{
            "ip":"127.0.0.1"
            },
        "additionalMsg":{
            "IP":"something unnormal"
            }
    }
}
```

### 2. Configure an alarm event rule

1. Go to the **Event Rule** page, select the target event bus, and create an event rule under it to filter the events for which to configure alarm push.

2. Taking CVM alarm configuration as an example, you can also select another event alarm or all events. For more information on event match rules, see [Event Pattern](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/42288).

### 3. Configure delivery targets

For event alarm scenarios, you can set **Notification message** for the delivery target.

- **Notification message**: You can configure a notification message to push your alarm events in the specified delivery method to promptly reach users.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/5d6e8323c1022cbcc64efc50fe095553.png)

After completing the configuration, you can view and configure the push of alarm events in the EventBridge console.

## Quickly Migrating Existing Users of Cloud Monitor Event Center

For existing users of Event Center, EventBridge offers a **quick migration** feature (see [Quick Migration Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1108/45205)). After you select quick migration, the backend service will automatically perform the following operations:

1. Automatically convert the existing alarm policies in Event Center to event rules in the Tencent Cloud service event bus (one policy corresponds to one rule).
2. Create the corresponding message push target for each existing notification template in Event Center and bind it to the default Tencent Cloud service event bus to complete alarm push.

>?
>- The default logset created by EventBridge offers a free tier of 1 GB per month for log storage. You can also configure CLS targets to record alarm events.
>- Quick migration can be performed repeatedly, and each time the existing configuration in Event Center will **overwrite all** event rules and delivery targets in EventBridge.
