### 1. EventBridge supports only the Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou regions. How do I process alarm events in other regions?
Alarm events from all regions can be received and processed by EventBridge, as the alarm events generated by businesses in different regions will be delivered to the Tencent Cloud service event bus in the Guangzhou region in a unified manner. You can manage all events delivered by services in different regions in this event bus.

### 2. Will global monitoring be performed on instances under the current account in the event alarm scenario?
 EventBridge can report all instance alarm events, which are actively pushed by businesses. Once an alarm is triggered, it will be automatically sent to EventBridge over the default link. You can also configure filter rules and delivery targets in the EventBridge console to determine how to process the delivered events as shown below:

### 3. Will EventBridge be charged in the future?
For Tencent Cloud service event delivery and alarm event processing, the Tencent Cloud service event bus in EventBridge will be free of charge. If you connect to and use other Tencent Cloud services such as SCF and CKafka in the downstream, you will be charged according to the billing rules of the corresponding services.
      
>? For the CLS delivery target, we provide a free tier of 1 GB per 30 days for log storage to help you manage and trace back event alarm messages.

### 4. How do I bind an alarm instance?
In an EventBridge link, the events of **all instances in all regions** are reported automatically by default, and you don't need to manually bind the instances. However, you can configure event rules to determine which events from which instances need to be pushed.

Event rule examples:
- Receiving all events:
Set "source" to "cvm.cloud.tencent", which indicates to receive and deliver all alarm events from CVM
```json
{
  "source":"cvm.cloud.tencent"
}
```
- Receiving specified events:
Only unreachable ping events from CVM are delivered. All other events will be discarded.
```json
{
  "source":"cvm.cloud.tencent",
  "type":"cvm:ErrorEvent:PingUnreachable"
}
```
- Receiving events from the specified instance:
Receive and deliver events of the CVM resource "ins-XXX". Other events are discarded.
```json
{
  "source":"cvm.cloud.tencent",
  "subject":"ins-xxxxxx"
}
```

### 5. How do I configure the thresholds supported by CM in the EventBridge console? 
   You can migrate only event alarms to EventBridge. Thresholds are metric alarms and still managed in the CM console.
