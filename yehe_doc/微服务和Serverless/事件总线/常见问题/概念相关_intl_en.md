### What is EventBridge?

Tencent Cloud EventBridge is a secure, stable, and standardized serverless event management platform. It supports standardized and centralized connections of Tencent Cloud services, custom applications, and SaaS applications, helping you easily implement a serverless event-driven architecture (EDA).

### What are the benefits and strengths of EventBridge?

- Ease of use
  EventBridge provides fully managed, OPS-free, and deployment-free serverless event management services, which rid you of the need to care about supporting components of event services and make your EDA construction much easier.
- Standardized connection
  EventBridge provides a unified Put Event push protocol, which is compatible with CloudEvents 1.0 specifications and fully embraces the open-source community ecosystem.
- Fast build
  EventBridge supports Tencent Cloud service event bus and cloud connectors to interconnect multiple data channels. You can quickly import data into it after simple necessary configurations. You can also convert and cleanse events in the cloud to meet the needs in various event use cases.
- High availability
  EventBridge can be deployed in a distributed cluster across AZs in a region-specific manner to offer strong disaster recovery capabilities, so that it can still be available even when some nodes or AZs are exceptional. In addition, it leverages different Tencent Cloud services to meet the needs of different business scenarios and make your service architecture even more robust.
- Supporting capabilities
  EventBridge offers various capabilities such as event query, log, and audit as well as full-linkage tracking. It also provides basic EDA capabilities, including event replay, backup, and retry policy.
