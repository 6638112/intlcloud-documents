### Social Networking
- Scenario description: when a user performs an operation such as liking, commenting, or sharing in an application with social networking features, the application can call the TPNS service to send a reminder message to target users, who can receive the reminder without opening the application. This can promote repeated user interaction, which helps form a closed functionality loop and improve the user activity.

- Scenario description: product teams generally need to carry out layered operational events for users in different phases throughout the product lifecycle, such as pushing product guides to new users. By accurately profiling new users, they can make precise predications in various aspects such as the problems that may occur in actual use and the events that may interest users the most, based on which they can actively push messages in a more targeted manner to improve the user retention rate and attract more active users.
