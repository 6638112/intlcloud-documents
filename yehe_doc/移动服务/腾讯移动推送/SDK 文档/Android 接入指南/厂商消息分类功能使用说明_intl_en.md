## Overview
Currently, to avoid end users from being disturbed, vendors are gradually starting to limit the number and frequency of notification messages pushed by application developers by type. The message type is mainly identified by the channel ID (`ChannelID`). TPNS divides messages into two types based on the types provided by major vendors:

- General message (default): this type is suitable for messages about group announcements, operational events, trending news, etc., which is mainly user-oriented universal content.
- Notification message/private message: this type is suitable for personal notification-related messages such as chat messages, order status changes, and transaction reminders. The number of notification messages is unlimited.

The message type can be specified when you call the push API.

**Directions:**

1. If you need to use vendor notification messages, apply for the channel ID as instructed in the following documents:
   - [OPPO Application Guide](#oppozhinan)
   - [Mi Application Guide](#xiaomizhinan)
After you get the channel ID, specify it when calling the push API.
Meizu and Huawei channels do not support notification messages currently, and they don't limit the number of messages. Vivo will support message types and quotas in June 2020.

2. If you do not need to use notification/private messages of a vendor and only need a customized channel ID to group messages based on your application's business message types, you can configure the channel ID based on the corresponding vendor's configuration description:

| Push Channel | Configuration Description |
| --------    | -------  |
| TPNS    |   1. On the application, call the channel ID creating API in the SDK for Android to create a channel ID<br>2. Specify the corresponding channel ID (no limit) when calling the TPNS [server API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764) |
| Huawei |   1. On the application, call the channel ID creating API in the SDK for Android to create a channel ID<br>2. Specify the corresponding channel ID (no limit) when calling the TPNS [server API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764) |
| Mi    | 1. Create a channel ID in the Mi Open Platform Console or through the corresponding Mi server API<br>2. Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the TPNS server API |
| OPPO    |   1. On the application, call the SDK for Android to create a channel ID<br>2. Register the same channel ID in the OPPO Console<br>3. Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the TPNS server API |
| Meizu    | No instructions on channel are provided |
| Vivo    | No instructions on channel are provided |

3. If you do not need notification messages of a vendor and customized channel ID, you do not need to perform relevant operations, and TPNS will specify a default channel ID for all messages of your application and group them into the default type.

## How to Apply for OPPO Notification Channel

### OPPO notification channel overview
The default channel on the Opush platform is the public message channel. Now, the "private message" channel is provided to push user-specific personalized messages, with no limit on the number of pushes. The comparison between "public message" and "private message" is as follows:

| Type | Public Message | Private Message |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Push content | Universal content for multiple users such as trending news, new product promotions, platform announcements, community topics, and lucky draws | Content closely related to individual users such as changes of orders, package delivery notifications, subscribed content updates, interactive comments, and loyalty program point updates |
| Push object | Multiple users (single user is also allowed) | Only single user |
| Maximum number of pushes | All public message channels share a total number of pushes; if the daily limit is reached, they will stop pushing messages on the day. The current maximum number of daily pushes is the total number of all registered users * 2 | Unlimited |
| Configuration method | Default | You need to register the channel with the Opush platform and set the corresponding channel attribute to "Private Message" |

>Official reminder from OPPO: you must not use the private message channel to push universal messages (such as trending news and new product promotions), as the backend will monitor the push content, and if you violate the operational rules, Opush has the right to disable your private channel access, and all consequences arising therefrom, such as exceptional API calls and delivery failures of messages sent through the private message channel shall be borne by you.

### Application for OPPO private message channel

1. Log in to the [Opush platform](https://push.oppo.com) and select **App Configuration** > **Create Channel** to create a channel. The channel ID and name are required and must be the same as those on the application client. Other configuration items are optional.
>Once the channel ID is set, it cannot be randomly changed or deleted.


2. Currently, the OPPO private message channel can take effect only after you apply for it through email. Please send an application email to Opush according to the following requirements. For more information, please see [Opush Channel Upgrade Beta Invitation](https://open.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc#id=10614).
