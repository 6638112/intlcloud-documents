TPNS provides two billing modes to meet customer needs in different scenarios: monthly subscription and pay-as-you-go.

The following table lists the differences between the two billing modes:

| Billing Mode | Monthly Subscription | Pay-as-you-go |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Payment mode | Prepaid | Postpaid and settled daily |
| Billable item | Monthly peak of daily connected devices | Daily connected devices |
| Unit price | Low | High |
| Minimum usage duration | At least one month | Resources are billed on a daily basis and can be purchased/released at any time |
| Use case | Business with long-term stable device needs | Scenarios where the number of devices fluctuates greatly |

## Monthly Subscription
Monthly subscription is a prepaid billing mode of TPNS. You need to pay for one or multiple months or even years in advance. Monthly subscription is cheaper than pay-as-you-go and is suitable for scenarios where the number of daily connected devices can be predicted.

Monthly subscription is pay before use. Before purchasing a TPNS service package, check your Tencent Cloud account balance. If your balance is less than the service cost, top up your account first.

## Pay-as-you-go
Pay-as-you-go is an elastic billing mode of TPNS. You can activate/terminate services at any time. Billing is based on the number of daily connected devices and settled daily. Pay-as-you-go is more expensive than monthly subscription and is suitable for scenarios where the number of daily connected devices fluctuates greatly.

After purchasing a pay-as-you-go service, make sure that your account balance is sufficient. If your account is in arrears for over 24 hours, the pay-as-you-go service will be suspended.
