## Overview

A charitable organization must meet the requirements of the Charity Law of the People’s Republic of China. For the purpose of the charity law, “charitable organization” refers to legally established nonprofit organizations that comply with this law and aim at conducting charitable activities for the public. Charitable organizations include foundations, social groups, social service agencies and other forms of organization.
