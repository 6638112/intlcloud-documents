As the restrictions of vendor channels on the push quota and frequency are gradually tightened, the arrival rate and delivery speed of pushes are also limited to a certain degree. For specific restrictions, please see:
- [Vendor Channel Limit Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/35829)
- [Vendor Channel QPS Limit Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/35247)

TPNS provides two channel assignment policies: "smart assignment" and "custom", which can improve the comprehensive arrival rate and push speed against the restrictions of the vendor channels.
## Channel Policy Overview
<span id="zhineng"></span>
### Smart assignment
TPNS will take into account the device status, group active status, and push channel status to intelligently assign the optimal delivery channel for each device to achieve the following effects:
1. Improve the comprehensive arrival rate of pushes
2. Improve the comprehensive arrival speed of pushes
3. Save available quotas for certain vendor channels

<span id="zidingyi"></span>
### Custom policy
Currently, Mi, OPPO, and Vivo channels limit the daily number of pushes. You can choose which channel a certain push task can be delivered through according to your business needs and adjust the push channel delivery policy in a personalized manner to save vendor channel resources and maximize the value of pushes.
The delivery rules of the custom policy are as detailed below:
