## Operation Scenarios

Rich media push allows you to push rich media contents such as image, audio, and video in addition to text, which can effectively increase the notification click rate. You can use this feature to push a wider variety of contents such as news, coupons, and event information, satisfying your personalized push needs.

## Scope of Application

Currently, the rich media push feature of TPNS supports the following types of rich media contents:

- Android: image and audio.
- iOS: image, audio, and video (the application needs to integrate with the [notification service extension plugin](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30730)).

The supported types of rich media and use requirements for each push channel are as detailed below:

## FAQs

#### The Meizu, OPPO, and Vivo channels do not support rich media. How do I deliver a notification when pushing to all devices?

Notifications delivered through the TPNS, Huawei, Mi, and FCM channels can contain images, while those delivered through the Meizu, OPPO, and Vivo channels are in text format without images by default.

#### How can I include an image in a push message?

No matter whether you call an API or use the console to deliver a message, you should generate a URL for the image to include it in the message.

#### What is the delivery policy for audio rich media on Android?

Audio rich media pushes delivered through the TPNS channel can display the audio normally, while those delivered through other channels will be in text format without audio by default.

#### Can notification image and notification audio/video be enabled for rich media notification on iOS at the same time?

No. Only one of them can be enabled at a time.
