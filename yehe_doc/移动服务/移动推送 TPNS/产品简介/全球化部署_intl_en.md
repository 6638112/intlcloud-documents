As mobile applications are getting more and more globalized, the collection of basic attributes of devices and the storage of operational data need to comply with local data protection regulations. To this end, we have launched a global deployment service that complies with the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which can implement global cluster deployment, data storage, and compliant marketing.

## 1. Currently available regions

TPNS currently has four clusters deployed in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hong Kong (China), and Singapore (Southeast Asia Pacific). The data between different clusters is completely isolated. You can choose a "service access point" when creating an instance.

| Service Access Point | Service Availability Area | Data Storage Location |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| South China (Guangzhou)<br/>ap-guangzhou      | Mainland China     | Guangzhou         |
| East China (Shanghai)<br/>ap-shanghai | Chinese mainland | Shanghai |
| Hong Kong, China<br/>ap-hongkong | Outside Mainland China | Hong Kong (China)     |
| Southeast Asia (Singapore)<br/>ap-singapore    | Outside Mainland China | Singapore       |

## 2. Regions that can be applied for

Based on Tencent Cloud's nodes in and outside Mainland China, TPNS currently can store data and push messages in more than 200 countries and regions. If you need to activate a new region, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=517&level2_id=554&source=0&data_title=%E8%85%BE%E8%AE%AF%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E6%8E%A8%E9%80%81%EF%BC%88%E8%85%BE%E8%AE%AF%E4%BF%A1%E9%B8%BD%EF%BC%89&step=1) for application.

>?Considering cost factors, the requirement for applying for activation of a new region is that the number of daily connected devices reaches 2 million.

Currently, regions that can be applied for include:

| Region | Service Availability Area | Data Storage Location |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| North America (Toronto) <br/>na-toronto     | Outside Mainland China | Toronto       |
| Europe (Moscow)<br/>eu-moscow      | Outside Mainland China | Moscow       |
| Europe (Frankfurt)<br/>eu-frankfurt | Outside Mainland China | Frankfurt     |
