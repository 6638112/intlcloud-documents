## Overview

This document describes how to quickly integrate the TPNS SDK into your Android application. You can use the TPNS service on your application after performing the following steps.

## Preparing for Integration

1. Before integrating the SDK, you need to log in to the [TPNS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns) and create the product and Android application. For detailed directions, please see [Creating Products and Applications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/32603).

2. Go to the **Configuration Management** page of the application to prepare for the integration.

## Starting Integration

1. On the **Configuration Management** page, click **Quick Integration**.

	If verification failure is reported, please check whether the application has been successfully registered with the push service as instructed in [Verifying the Integration Result](#jierujieguo).
>!To increase the offline reach rate, the TPNS SDK enables the session keep-alive feature by default. To disable the feature, see [here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/32624#how-do-i-disable-the-keep-alive-feature-of-tpns.3F).

## Verifying the Integration Result

1. Run the application, filter logs by the "TPush" keyword, and view the displayed logs.

   If a log similar to that shown in the preceding figure is displayed, the TPNS SDK has been successfully integrated as a plugin.
2. Check whether the registration with the push service is successful. The following log indicates successful registration.
```plaintext
XG register push success with token:6ed8af8d7b18049d9fed116a9db9c71ab4aabb65
```
If the token cannot be found, please check the error code returned by the registration API and troubleshoot as instructed in [Error Code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30722).

## Quickly Integrating with a Vendor Channel

1. On the **Configuration Management** page, enable the vendor push channel and configure the application information such as `AppId` and `SecretKey`. For more information about how to apply for such information, see the documentation of the vendor channel.
 - Click **View Documentation** to see the vendor channel description.
 - Configure `AppId`, `AppKey`, and `AppSecret` for the vendor channel.

2. After configuring the vendor channel information, click **Download Configuration File** at the top of the page to download the vendor channel configuration file and use it to replace the legacy one in the project file.

## Troubleshooting

1. View the Android Gradle plugin logs.
 If an exception occurs during integration, set the `debug` field in the `tpns-configs.json` file to `true` and run the following command: 
```
./gradlew --rerun-tasks :app:processReleaseManifest 
```
Then, use the `TpnsPlugin` keyword for analysis.
2. Click the **sync projects** icon.

3. Check whether relevant dependencies exist in **External Libraries** of the project.

4. If the log displays `Execution failed for task ':Paracraft:checkTPNS'`, the TPNS Android SDK can be updated to a later version. If you do not want to check for updates, add `"upgrade": false` to the `tpns-configs.json` file, as shown below:

5. If you encounter the version mismatch between the Android Gradle plugin and Gradle version when using the plugin, upgrade the Gradle version by referring to [Android Gradle plugin release notes](https://developer.android.google.cn/studio/releases/gradle-plugin). The table below lists which version of Gradle is required for each version of the Android Gradle plugin.
