Applications created in the [TPNS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns) after July 1, 2020 are eligible for a push service trial free of charge, which allows you to try out and connect to the TPNS service with ease.

> ?
>1. The trial version does not limit the use duration and number of pushes and provides the same features as the paid version, such as message push through vendor channel, notification bar message collapsing, and rich media notification.
>2. A trial version application supports up to 1,000 devices for testing. After the number of daily connected devices exceeds 1,000, service suspension will be triggered, and the resource will be repossessed by the system on the eighth day after the service is suspended. At that time, your application token information, account and tag information, push history, and other resource data will be deleted immediately and cannot be recovered. If your application exceeds the limit, please make a payment to activate the TPNS service in time. For activation steps, please see [Purchase Directions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/37863).
