TPNS provides [Instant Messaging (IM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/im) with the offline push capability. For an instant messaging app or an app with instant messaging features, you are advised to integrate it with IM for instant messaging capabilities in [different scenarios](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/im). You can activate IM in the [IM console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/im).

You can integrate an instant messaging app with [IM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/im) and the [SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/34673) of [TPNS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/tpns) for a complete push service. This helps improve the push delivery rate and implement diversified push scenarios without the need to integrate with different vendor channels separately. End users would like to be able to get the latest messages at any time, but the performance and power of mobile devices are limited. When the app is running in the background, to avoid excessive resource consumption caused by maintaining a persistent connection, you can use TPNS for offline message notifications. It provides a more stable system-level persistent connection, allowing end users to receive push messages at any time and greatly reducing resource consumption.
