## Overview

Currently, to avoid end users from being frequently disturbed, vendors are gradually starting to limit the number and frequency of notification messages pushed by application developers by type. The message type is mainly identified by the channel ID (`ChannelID`). TPNS divides messages into two types based on the types provided by major vendors:

- General message (default): this type is suitable for messages about group announcements, operational events, trending news, etc., which is mainly user-oriented universal content.
- Notification message/private message: this type is suitable for personal notification-related messages such as chat messages, order status changes, and transaction reminders. The number of notification messages is unlimited.

You can specify the message type when calling the push API.

#### Directions

1. If you need to use vendor notification messages, apply for or create a channel ID as instructed in the following sections:
	- [OPPO](#oppozhinan)
	- [Mi](#xiaomizhinan)
	- [vivo](#vivozhinan)
	- [Huawei](#huaweizhinan)
	

 After you get the channel ID, specify it when calling the push API. Meizu and Huawei channels do not support notification messages currently, and they don't limit the number of messages.
2. If you do not need to use vendor notification/private messages and only need a custom channel ID to group messages based on your application's business message types, you can configure the channel ID based on the corresponding vendor's configuration description:
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Push Channel</th>
<th>Configuration Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>TPNS</td>
<td><ul><li>On the application, call the channel ID creating API in the SDK for Android to create a channel ID.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID (no limit) when calling the TPNS <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Huawei</td>
<td><ul><li>On the application, call the channel ID creating API in the SDK for Android to create a channel ID.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID (no limit) when calling the TPNS <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mi</td>
<td><ul><li>Create a channel ID in the Mi open platform console or through the corresponding Mi server API.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the TPNS server API. </li></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OPPO</td>
<td><ul><li>On the application, call the SDK for Android to create a channel ID.</li><li>Register the same channel ID in the OPPO console.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the TPNS server API.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Meizu</td>
<td>No instructions on channels are provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>vivo</td>
<td><ul><li>Call the server API to create a channel ID.</li><li>Specify the corresponding channel ID when calling the TPNS <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764">server API</a>.</li></ul></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
3. If you do not need vendor notification messages nor a custom channel ID, you do not need to perform relevant operations, and TPNS will specify a default channel ID for all messages of your application and group them into the default type.

## OPPO Notification Channel Application Guide

### OPPO notification channel overview

The default channel on the OPPO PUSH platform is the public message channel. Now, the private message channel is provided to push personalized messages to individual users, with no limit on the number of pushes. The table below compares the public and private message channels.

| Type | Public Message Channel | Private Message Channel |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Push content | Universal content for multiple users, for example, trending news, new product promotions, platform announcements, community topics, and lucky draws | Content closely related to individual users such as changes of orders, package delivery notifications, subscribed content updates, interactive comments, and loyalty program point updates |
| Push object | Multiple users (single user is also allowed) | Only single user |
| Maximum number of pushes | All public message channels share a total number of pushes; if the daily limit is reached, they will stop pushing messages on the day. The current maximum number of daily pushes is twice the total number of all registered users | Unlimited |
| Configuration method | Default | You need to register the channel with the OPPO PUSH platform and set the corresponding channel attribute to **Private Message** |

>! !Official reminder from OPPO: you must not use the private message channel to push universal messages (such as trending news and new product promotions), as the backend will monitor the push content, and if you violate the operational rules, OPPO PUSH has the right to disable your private message channel access, and all consequences arising therefrom, such as API call exceptions and delivery failures of messages sent through the private message channel shall be borne by you.

### Applying for the OPPO private message channel

1. Log in to the [OPPO PUSH platform](https://push.oppo.com) and choose **App Configuration** > **Create Channel** to create a channel. The channel ID and name are required and must be the same as those on the application client. Other configuration items are optional.

>! Once the channel ID is set, it cannot be changed or deleted.



2. Currently, the OPPO private message channel can take effect only after you apply for it through email. Please send an application email to the OPPO PUSH platform according to the following requirements. For more information, see [OPPO PUSH Channel Upgrade Beta Invitation](https://open.oppomobile.com/wiki/doc#id=10614).
```plaintext
Standard for applying for the public/private message channel beta eligibility: total number of users for OPPO PUSH â‰¥ 300,000
Application method: send an email to push@oppo.com for application. You can use the following email template:
Application ID: XXX
Application name: XXX
Total number of users: XXX
Dedicated private channel name:
Dedicated private channel ID:
WeChat account of business contact:
I apply for connection to the OPPO PUSH beta public/private message service for the XX application. I undertake to comply with the operational rules and will not use the private message channel to push any marketing messages.
```

### Using the OPPO private message channel

1. Create a notification channel for the client in either of the following ways:
	Use the corresponding Android API to create a notification channel. For more information, see [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/notify-user/channels).
	Use the TPNS SDK (v1.1.5.4 or above) to create a notification channel. For more information, see [Creating Notification Channel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30715).
2. Configure RESTful API push.
   Set the `oppo_ch_id` parameter in the Android structure of the RESTful API request parameters to implement delivery based on the notification channel. For more information, see [push API parameter description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).

Currently, notifications pushed through the OPPO private message channel can be delivered only through RESTful APIs but not the console.

Below is a sample push:
```
{
    "audience_type": "token",
    "token_list": ["005c28bf60e29f9a1c2052ce96f43019a0b7"],
    "message_type": "notify",
    "message": {
    "title": "Test title",
    "content": "Test content",
    "android": {
        "oppo_ch_id": "Private message channel ID"}
    }
}
```

## vivo System Message Channel Application Guide

### vivo message classification overview

vivo classifies push messages into operation messages and system messages.

| Message Category | Quota         | Message Display on Notification Bar                    | Frequency Control Rule After June 1, 2020            |
| -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Operation message | Number of SDK subscriptions x 2 | Collapsed when the application is not active and displayed when the application is active | Up to 5 messages per application per user per day |
| System message | Number of SDK subscriptions x 2 | Displayed regardless of whether the application is active           | No limit on the number of messages received by users                     |

> ?
>1. Before June 1, 2020, regardless of whether the message classification feature is enabled, the frequency control rule remains the same: up to 5 **public messages (full push, group push, tag push)** per application per user per day, and no limit on the number of messages per push. From June 1, 2020 on, the frequency control rule specifies that the upper limit for **operation messages** per application per user is 5, and if any user experience-related complaint arises, the number will be adjusted.
>2. Funtouch OS 10 or above does not provide a message box, and messages are displayed on the narrow bar when the application is not active.
>3. Both the system message quota and operation message quota will automatically change with the number of SDK subscriptions. If special circumstances require an increase in the system message quota, please submit an application as instructed in the next session.

### Applying for vivo system messages

1. System messages can be created only through vivo server APIs but not on the vivo web operation platform. The API has a new request field `classification`, where `0` indicates operation message and `1` indicates system message. If the field is left empty, `0` will be used by default. For more information, see the [vivo server API documentation](https://dev.vivo.com.cn/documentCenter/doc/362).
2. The system message quota is twice the number of SDK subscriptions by default. To increase the quota, send an application email based on the template below to push@vivo.com:
```plaintext
Subject: Application for Increasing the Quota of IM/System Messages for Application XXX
Body: â€¦
Application name: â€¦
Package name: â€¦
Application overview: â€¦
IM/System message quota required (unit: 10,000): ...
Description of the specific push scenario: for example, personal user chat and merchant chat
```

### Using vivo system messages

Currently, vivo notification messages can be delivered only through RESTful APIs but not the console.
Set the `vivo_ch_id` parameter in the Android structure of the RESTful API request parameters to `1` to implement delivery of vivo system messages. For more information, see [push API parameter description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).
Below is a sample push:

```json
{
    "audience_type": "token",
    "token_list": ["005c28bf60e29f9a***2052ce96f43019a0b7"],
    "message_type": "notify",
    "message": {
    "title": "vivo system notification",
    "content": "Test content",
    "android": {
        "vivo_ch_id": "1"
    }
}
```

## Huawei Notification Channel User Guide

### Huawei notification channel overview

Starting from EMUI 10.0, Huawei's push service intelligently classifies notification messages into two levels: **common and important**. Before EMUI 10.0, there is only one level and all messages are displayed through the **default notification** channel, equivalent to important messages in EMUI 10.0.

The table below compares the display style of messages at different levels.

| Message Level | Display in Notification Center | Display in Status Bar | Notification for Screen Lock | Ringtone | Vibration |
| -------- | ---------------- | -------------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| Important     | Normal         | Supported           | Supported    | Supported | Supported |
| Common     | Normal         | Not supported             | Not supported       | Not supported   | Not supported   |

Classification rules:

- Obtain message types based on the title and content of notification messages sent by developers.
  Message types include marketing, feature, life, social networking, transaction, work, alarm, and others.

- Obtain message levels through mapping the types of received messages.
  Messages are divided into two levels: common and important.

  For example, content recommendations sent by applications (such as information from audio and video, reading, and video applications) and surveys (such as questionnaires) will be intelligently classified as common notifications; logistics status, such as dispatched, signed, delivering, and pickup information will be intelligently classified as important notifications.

>! Intelligent notification classification is available only to terminal devices in Chinese mainland.

### Creating a Huawei notification channel

Huawei Push supports customizing notification channels for applications. To create a notification channel on the client, use either of the following methods:

Use the Android API to create a notification channel. For more information, see [Create and Manage Notification Channels](https://developer.android.google.cn/training/notify-user/channels).
Use the TPNS SDK (version 1.1.5.4 or later). For more information, see [Creating notification channel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30715) in the API documentation.

### Using a Huawei notification channel

Currently, notifications pushed through Huawei's custom channel can be delivered only through a RESTful API but not the console. After a notification channel is created, you can:

Configure the `hw_ch_id` parameter in the Android request structure of the RESTful API to push messages through the Huawei notification channel. For more information, see the parameter description in [Push API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/33764).

> ! If you configure the `hw_ch_id` parameter, TPNS automatically configures the level of messages pushed through the Huawei channel as important. However, according to Huawei's push rules, the ultimate display effect of pushed messages is determined by both the levels specified by TPNS and Huawei's intelligent classification, whichever is lower. For example, if TPNS and Huawei's intelligent classification classify messages as important and common respectively, the message level "common" will be used. For more information, see [Intelligent Message Classification](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/development/HMSCore-Guides/android-intelligent-classification-0000001050040120).

Below is a sample push:

```json
{
    "audience_type": "token",
    "token_list": ["005c28bf60e29f9a***2052ce96f43019a0b7"],
    "message_type": "notify",
    "message": {
        "title": "Huawei notification message",
        "content": "Test content",
        "android": {
            "hw_ch_id": "channel_id of the Huawei notification message"
        }
    }
}
```
