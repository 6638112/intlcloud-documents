## vivo Channel Limits

### Quota description

- The daily message delivery limit is calculated based on the number of SDK subscriptions. If the actual number of SDK subscriptions is below 10,000, it will be calculated as 10,000; otherwise, the actual number will be used. Currently, the proportions of single pushes and group pushes are not limited. The number of users to whom single-push and group-push messages can be sent cannot exceed the daily message delivery limit.
- Public message: push messages include full-push, group-push, and tag-push messages. A user can receive up to 5 public messages per day. The number of arrived messages is counted in the quota. Once a message arrives at a user phone, no matter whether notification is enabled on the phone, the remaining quota will decrease by one.
  - Full push: one full-push message can be sent to all application users subscribing to vivo push (`turnOPush` succeeds on the client) per day by default. If the number of messages arrived at user phones reaches the quota, excessive messages will not be sent.
 - Group push: a group push can be used to send a message to multiple users. The number of user phones at which a message arrives is counted in the quota; for example, if a message arrives at the clients of 500 valid users, 500 will be deducted from the quota. "Group push message body" refers to the group push message body saved by calling an API, whose quantity limit is 1,000 by default and increases with the number of SDK subscriptions.
 - Tag push: the rule is the same as that of group push.
- Personalized information message: it refers to single push, for which only the daily total number of pushes is limited, while the number of pushes that can be received by one user is not limited. One message can be sent to only one user, and the remaining quota will decrease by one once a message arrives at a valid `regId`.
