## Huawei Phone Badge Adaptation Guide

### Use limits
Badge display is supported for Huawei phones on EMUI 8.0 or above.
Limited by the openness of Huawei phone badge capabilities, the badge feature varies by push scenario as detailed below. Please use the Huawei phone badge feature as instructed.

| Push Form | Badge Capability | Implementation Method |
|:-:|:--:|:--:|
| Notification through Huawei channel | The badge number is auto increased by 1 or unchanged when a push message is received | This feature can be set in the console or through the push API keyword |
| Notification through TPNS channel | When the user clicks or dismisses a notification pushed through TPNS channel, the badge number can be auto decreased by 1, which is not supported for notifications pushed through the Huawei channel | This feature can be adapted through the TPNS SDK with no additional settings required |
| In-app message | You can process the increase/decrease logic by yourself | An open API of the TPNS SDK can be called to implement this feature |



### Implementation method
#### Applying for permission to set in-app badge
To implement the correct badge modification effect, please first apply for the Huawei phone badge read/write permission for your application by adding the following permission configuration under the `manifest` tag in the application's `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="com.huawei.android.launcher.permission.CHANGE_BADGE "/>
```
#### Setting notification delivery badge
You can implement the badge for push message delivery in the notification bar on the push page in the console or through the RESTful API. You need to enable the Huawei channel in the console and enter the `Activity` class of the application entry corresponding to the homescreen icon in parameter configurations, such as `com.test.badge.MainActivity`; otherwise, the badge settings will not take effect. The settings are as shown below:

#### Setting badge rules
**Method 1:** set on the push page in the console
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/bd1156cf0106d3894c5aa900884c3988.png)

**Method 2:** set through the `Push` API
  In the push message body, add the `badge_type` field with the following attributes under `body.message.android`:

| Parameter Name | Type | Parent Project | Required | Default Value | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|  badge_type | int | android| No |-1 | Notification badge, which takes effect only for Huawei devices. Valid values: <br><li>-2: auto increased by 1<br><li>-1: unchanged |


Sample message body:
```json
{
	"audience_type": "token",
	"expire_time": 3600,
	"message_type": "notify",
	"message": {
			"android": {
					"badge_type": -2,
					"clearable": 1,
					"ring": 1,
					"ring_raw": "xtcallmusic",
					"vibrate": 1,
					"lights": 1,
					"action": {
							"action_type": 1,
							"activity": "com.qq.xg4all.JumpActivity",
							"aty_attr": {
							"if": 0,
							"pf": 0
					}
					}
			},
			"title": "android test",
			"content": "android test 21"
	},
	"token_list": [
		"01f6ac091755a79015b4a30c9c4c7ddba1ea"
	],
	"multi_pkg": true,
	"platform": "android",
}
```

#### Setting in-app message badge

You can implement the badge number increase/decrease logic of TPNS in-app messages by calling the corresponding API provided in the SDK v1.1.6.0 or above.
You can get in-app message content by inheriting `com.tencent.android.tpush.XGPushBaseReceiver` and implementing the callback API `onTextMessage(Context context, XGPushTextMessage message)`. You can call the following API in this callback method to increase the badge number by 1:
```java
/**
     * Huawei phone badge modification API
     *
     * @param context   Application context
     * @param changeNum   Changed number, which is incremental during modification; for example, if the badge number 5 and the input parameter is 1, it will be increased to 6
     *		Valid values: 1: the badge number is increased by 1; -1: the badge number is decreased by 1
     */
XGPushConfig.changeHuaweiBadgeNum(Context context, int changeNum);
```

Example: when an in-app message is received, call `XGPushConfig.changeHuaweiBadgeNum(context, 1)` to increase the badge number by 1; when the message badge needs to be dismissed, call `XGPushConfig.changeHuaweiBadgeNum(context, -1)` to decrease the badge number by 1.


#### Resetting badge number
As the badge number set for notifications through the Huawei channel cannot be auto decreased by 1 to respond to user's click/dismissal event, you are recommended to call the following API to reset the application badge number upon application start or at other appropriate times:

```java
/*
     * Resetting Huawei phone badge number
     * You are recommended to reset the badge number upon application start or at other appropriate times
     * @param context   Application context
     */
XGPushConfig.resetHuaweiBadgeNum(Context context)
```
