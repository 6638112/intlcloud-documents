2. Click **Purchase** and complete the payment. Then, you can log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) to see your CVM.
Information such as the instance name, public IP address, private IP address, login username, and initial login password of the CVM will be sent to your account through the [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message). You can use this information to log in to and manage your instances. To ensure the security of your CVM, please change your CVM login password as soon as possible.

## Logging in to and Connecting the Instance

After completing CVM operations, you can log in to your CVM on the Tencent Cloud Console and perform operations such as building a site as needed.
Select a method for logging in to the CVM on the Tencent Cloud Console as needed:
- [Log in to a Windows CVM Instance Using the RDP File (Recommended)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5435)
- [Log in to a Windows CVM Instance Using Remote Desktop](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32498)

## Formatting and Partitioning the Data Disk

If you added a data disk when [selecting the instance type](#SelectType), you need to format and partition the data disk after logging in to the CVM instance. **If you have not added any data disks, skip this step.**
Select the appropriate operations guide according to the disk capacity and the CVM operating system.
- For a disk smaller than 2 TB:
[Initializing a Cloud Disk (Windows)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31597)
