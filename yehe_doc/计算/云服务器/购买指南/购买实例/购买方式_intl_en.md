Tencent Cloud allows users to purchase CVMs either from the console or via API. This document describes these two purchase methods in detail.

## Purchasing from the console

All users can purchase CVMs on [Tencent Cloud Console](http://manage.qcloud.com/shoppingcart/shop.php?tab=cvm). Based on different billing methods, you can purchase two types of CVMs: pay-as-you-go instance (billing is accurate to seconds and settled on an hourly basis) and spot instance (billing is accurate to seconds and settled on an hourly basis). For more information, see [Pricing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).
Below describes how to purchase these two types of CVMs from the console.
