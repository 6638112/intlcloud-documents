## Billing Mode

The Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) is pay-as-you-go. For details, see [Pricing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).

## Instances

An instance type you specify determines the hardware configuration of its host. Every instance type has different computing and storage capacities. You can choose the computing capacity, storage space, and network access method for the instances suited to your service scale. 
Depending on the underlying hardware, Tencent Cloud provides various models, as detailed in [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518).

For more information about instance prices, see [Pricing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).

## Storage

Tencent Cloud provides a wide range of flexible, cost-effective and user-friendly data storage devices for CVM instances. These storage devices perform differently at different prices for use cases. Storage devices fall into the following categories by dimensions:

- HDD disk and SSD disk by storage medium.
- System disk and data disk by use case.
- Cloud disk, local disk and Cloud Object Storage by architectural pattern.

Tencent Cloud now has three cloud disks, including HDD cloud disk, Premium Cloud Storage, and SSD, billed by monthly subscription or pay as you go.
For more information about disk prices, see [Pricing List](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2255).

## Network Bandwidth

Tencent Cloud provides high-quality multi-line BGP networks for ISPs to ensure optimal network experience. Two billing modes are available to network: bill-by-traffic and bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-bandwidth: it is billed based on the public network transmission rate (in Mbps). When your bandwidth utilization is higher than 10%, we recommend bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-traffic: it is billed based on the total amount of data transmission (in GB). When your bandwidth utilization is less than 10%, we recommend bill-by-traffic.

For more information about the network billing mode, see [Public Network Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).
