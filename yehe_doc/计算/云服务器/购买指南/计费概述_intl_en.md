## Billing Mode

Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) is a pay-as-you-go service. For details, see [Billing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180).

## Instances

The instance type determines the hardware configuration of its host. Every instance type has different computing and storage capacities. You can choose the computing capacity, storage space, and network access method for the instances that best suits your service scale. 
Tencent Cloud provides various models with different hardware specifications. For details, please see [Instance Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518).

## Network Bandwidth

Tencent Cloud provides high-quality multi-line BGP networks for ISPs to ensure optimal network experience. There are two billing options: bill-by-traffic and bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-bandwidth: billed based on the public network transmission rate (in Mbps). When your bandwidth utilization is higher than 10%, we recommend bill-by-bandwidth.
- Bill-by-traffic: it is billed based on the total amount of data transmission (in GB). When your bandwidth utilization is less than 10%, we recommend bill-by-traffic.
