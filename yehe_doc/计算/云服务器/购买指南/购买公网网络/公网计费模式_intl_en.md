# Public Network Billing

### Overview

Tencent Cloud provides high-quality multi-line BGP networks to ensure the optimal network experience.

For now, the network fee is based on the traffic usage, i.e., the total data volume transferred through internet.

### Billing plan

- The public network fee is based on the outbound traffic. Outbound traffic refers to the traffic going from your CVM to internet, e.g., when a user downloads files that are hosted on your CVM instance via internet.
- To avoid unexpected costs due to traffic surges, you can set a bandwidth cap. Any traffic over the cap is dropped and does not incur charges.
