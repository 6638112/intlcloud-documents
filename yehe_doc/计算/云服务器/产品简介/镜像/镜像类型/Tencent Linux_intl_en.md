Tencent Linux (Tlinux) is Tencentâ€™s Linux operating system designed for cloud scenarios. With specialized features and optimized performance, Tencent Linux provides a high-performance, secure, and reliable operating environment for applications in Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instances. Tencent Linux is free of charge, and applications developed on CentOS distributions can directly run on Tencent Linux. In addition, Tencent Cloud continuously provides you with updates, maintenance, and technical support.

## Use Cases
Tencent Linux can be used in the following scenarios:
- Tencent Linux is suitable for instances of most CVM types.
- When launching instances, Tencent Linux is used to transfer related operations to cloud-init via user data (the userdata field) to support dynamic configuration.
