Tencent Linux (Tlinux) is Tencentâ€™s Linux operating system designed for cloud scenarios. With specialized features and optimized performance, Tlinux provides a high-performance, secure, and reliable operating environment for applications in Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instances. Tlinux is free of charge, and applications developed on CentOS distributions can directly run on Tlinux. In addition, Tencent Cloud continuously provides you with updates, maintenance, and technical support.

## Use Cases
Tlinux can be used in the following scenarios:
- Tlinux is suitable for instances of most CVM types.
