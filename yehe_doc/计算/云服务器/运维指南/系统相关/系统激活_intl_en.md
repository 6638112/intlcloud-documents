CVMs use KMS to authorize Windows servers.
> 
> - This document is only applicable to Windows Server public images provided by Tencent Cloud. Custom and imported images cannot use the activation methods described in this document.
> - Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 need to be authorized using this method. The default KMS address (kms.tencentyun.com:1668) configured for the public images of Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2019 is correct and does not need to be modified.


## Notes
1. SPP Notification Service in Windows is used to run activation services. Make sure it runs properly, as shown in the following figure:

2. Some optimization software may disable modifying the execute permissions of service-related programs. For example, if the execute permissions of sppsvc.exe processes are modified, services may have an exception.
