## Operation Scenario
This document describes how to edit tags of resources.

## Use Limits

There are several limitations on editing tags:
- Quantity: each resource can have at most 50 tags.
- Tag key limitations:
  - You cannot create tag keys that start with `qcloud`, `tencent`, and `project` as they are reserved for the system.
  - Tag keys can only contain `numbers`, `alphabet characters`, `+=.@-`, and must be less than 255 characters.
- Tag value: tag values can only contain `empty strings or numbers`, `alphabet characters`, `+=.@-`, and must be less than 127 characters.
