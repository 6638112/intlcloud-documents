## Scenario
You can bind one or more security groups to a CVM. If you have bound multiple security groups, these security groups are executed based on their priorities, such as 1, 2, and 3. You can adjust the priorities as follows.

## Prerequisites
The instance is associated with two or more security groups.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. On the instance management page, click the ID of the CVM instance to go to the details page.
3. Click the **Security Group** tab to go to the security group management page.
4. In the "Bound Security Group" section on the right, click **Order** and select <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/15a91d68b0396cb89bfd75a578b42130.png" style="margin:-3px 0px;width:20px"> to the right of the group.
