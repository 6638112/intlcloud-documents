### Obtaining the private IP address using API
Please see [DescribeInstances API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33258).

### Obtaining the private IP address using instance metadata

1. Log in to the CVM.
2. Access the instance metadata by using the cURL tool or an HTTP GET request.
> The following operations use the cURL tool as an example.
>
Execute the following command to obtain the private IP.

## Configuring private network DNS 
When a network resolution error occurs, you can manually configure the private network DNS based on your CVM operating system.

### For Linux operating system

1. Log into the Linux CVM.
2. Execute the following command to open the `/etc/grub.conf` file.
```
vi /etc/resolv.conf
```
3. Press **i** to switch to the edit mode, and modify the DNS IP according to the corresponding region in the [Private Network DNS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5225) list.
For example, change the private network DNS IP to an private network DNS server in the Beijing region.
```
nameserver 10.53.216.182
nameserver 10.53.216.198
options timeout:1 rotate
```
4. Press **Esc**, enter **:wq**, save the file and return.

### For Windows operating system

2. On the operating system interface, open **Control Panel** > **Network and Sharing Center** > **Change adapter settings**.
3. Right-click the **Ethernet** and select **Properties** to open the “Ethernet Properties” window.
4. In the “Ethernet Properties” window, double-click **IP version 4 (TCP/IPv4)**, as shown below:
