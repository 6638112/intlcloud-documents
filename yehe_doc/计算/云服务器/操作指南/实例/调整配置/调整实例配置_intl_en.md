## Scenario

Hardware devices of Tencent Cloud CVM instances can be adjusted quickly and flexibly. This document describes the operation methods for configuration upgrade, downgrade, and cross-model adjustment.

## Prerequisites

You can adjust the configuration of an instance when it is in shutdown or running status. If the instance is running, the adjustment takes effect after it is forcibly shut down and restarted.
> 
> - If the instance has been **shut down**, you can adjust its configuration directly via the console.
> - If the instance is **running**, you can adjust its configuration online and confirm to force shut down the instance. The adjustment takes effect after the instance is restarted.
> - You can adjust the configurations of instances online **in batches**. If an instance in the batch operation is **running**, you need to confirm to force shut down the instance. The adjustment takes effects after the instance is restarted.

## Limits and Impacts

### Configuration adjustment limits

Only instances **whose system and data disks are both CBS cloud disks** support configuration adjustment.
- Configuration upgrade:
No limits on the number of configuration upgrades. The upgrade takes effect immediately.
- Configuration downgrade:
 Pay-as-you-go instances can be downgraded at any time. No limits on the number of downgrades.
- Adjustment across instance families: configurations can be adjusted between instance families without the need for data migration.
During configuration adjustment, target specifications depend on the instance types provided in the current availability zone. Note the following limits:
 - **Spot instances** do not support cross-model configuration adjustment.
 - **Dedicated instances** do not support cross-model configuration adjustment. The adjustment scope is subject to the remaining resources of the dedicated host where the instance is located.
 - **Heterogeneous instances such as GPU and FPGA instances** cannot be used as the source or target instance type for configuration adjustment across instance families.
 - **Instances configured with a basic network** cannot be adjusted to instances that only support VPC.
 - If the target instance type does not support the CBS disk type configured for the current instance type, the configuration cannot be adjusted.
 - If the target instance type does not support the image type configured for the current instance type, the configuration cannot be adjusted.
 - If the target instance type does not support the ENI or ENI quantity configured for the current instance type, the configuration cannot be adjusted. For more information, see [Use Limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/576/18527).
 - If the target instance type does not support the public network bandwidth cap configured for the current instance type, the configuration cannot be adjusted. For more information, see [Public Network Bandwidth Cap](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12523).

### Impacts

The private IP of an instance may change after configuration adjustment. In this case, a prompt will appear on the configuration adjustment page. Otherwise, the private IP will remain the same.

## Directions

>
> - If your business changes, you can adjust the instance configuration.
> - During configuration upgrade, upgrade accordingly and pay for fees that may be incurred.
> - During configuration downgrade, confirm the refund detail and forcibly shut down and restart your CVM instance for the new configuration to take effect immediately.

### Configuration adjustment via the console

#### Adjusting the configuration of a single instance

1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm) and click **Instances** to view the CVM instance list.
2. Locate the instance to be adjusted and choose **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Adjust Configuration** in the **Operation** column on the right, as shown in the following figure:

3. In the "Select target configuration" step, confirm the instance status and operation, **select the required model and specifications, confirm the performance parameters**, and click **Next**, as shown in the following figure:

4. Based on the instance billing method, confirm the fees and click **Next**.
	- Pay-as-you-go instances: confirm the amount to be frozen for the new instance type. After configuration adjustment, pay-as-you-go instances are charged starting from the tier-1 price. Confirm the billing rules, as shown in the following figure:

5. In the "Shutdown CVM" step, read the prompt carefully based on the instance running status.
 - If the current instance is running, read the prompt carefully and select "Agree to forced shutdown", as shown in the following figure:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/e016f2cc674938acd0046115f007669b.png)
 - If the current instance is shut down, the following prompt will appear:

6. Click **Adjust Now** to go to the order page and complete the payment. 

### Configuration adjustment via APIs 

You can use the ResetInstancesType API to adjust the instance configuration. For more information, see the [ResetInstancesType](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33239) API documentation.
