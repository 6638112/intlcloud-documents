Tencent Cloud allows you to change the public network billing mode or public network bandwidth as needed. The change takes effect immediately. To learn about the restrictions and updated prices after the change, see [Adjusting Public Network Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10580).

## Changing Billing Mode
Tencent Cloud provides two network billing plans: bill-by-traffic and bill-by-bandwidth. You can switch between them in the console by performing the following steps.
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. At the top of the **Instances** page, select the region where the target CVM instance resides.
3. Locate the CVM instance for which you want to adjust the bandwidth, and click **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Adjust Network** under the **Operation** column.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the network billing mode you want to use, and click **Confirm**.

## Adjusting Public Network Bandwidth
Tencent Cloud provides two types of public network configurations: dedicated and shared. The shared public network is billed by bandwidth package, which is currently in beta. You need to [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to apply for it. This document describes how to adjust the dedicated network configurations. Perform the following steps to change the bandwidth cap of a CVM instance:
1. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/index).
2. At the top of the **Instances** page, select the region where the target CVM instance resides.
3. Locate the CVM instance for which you want to adjust the bandwidth, and click **More** > **Resource Adjustment** > **Adjust Network** under the **Operation** column.
4. In the pop-up dialog box, select a new bandwidth cap and click **Confirm**.
