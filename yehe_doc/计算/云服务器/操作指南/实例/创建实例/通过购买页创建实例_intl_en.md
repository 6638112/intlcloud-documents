## Overview

This document guides you through how to create a Tencent Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instance using the custom configuration mode as an example.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a CVM instance, you need to complete the following steps:
- [Sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) and complete [identity verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).
- To create a CVM instance whose network type is virtual private cloud (VPC), you need to [create a VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805) in the target region and [create a subnet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31806) in the target availability zone under the VPC.
- If you do not use the default project, you need to [create a project](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/34726).
- If you do not use the default security group, you need to [create a security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34271) in the target region and add a security group rule that meets your business requirements.
- To bind a SSH key pair when creating a Linux instance, you need to [create a SSH key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16691) for the target project.
- To create a CVM instance with a custom image, you need to [create a custom image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942) or [import an image](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4945).

## Directions

1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/). Choose **Products** -> **Compute** -> **[Cloud Virtual Machine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cvm)**. Click **Get Started** to access the CVM purchase page.
 - **[Custom Configuration](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/cvm?tab=custom):** This mode is suitable for specific use cases. It allows users to purchase a CVM instance that meets their specific requirements.
2. Configure the following information as prompted by the page:
<table>
<tr><th style="width: 20%">Category</th><th style="width: 12%">Required/Optional</th><th>Configuration Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>Billing Mode</td><td>Required</td><td>Please select based on your actual needs:<ul><li><b>Pay as you go</b>: an elastic billing mode for the CVM.</ul>For more information on billing modes, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180">Billing Modes</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Region/Availability Zone</td><td>Required</td><td><ul><li><b>Region</b>: we recommend you select the region closest to your customers to reduce access latency and increase access speed.</li><li><b>Availability zone</b>: please select based on your actual needs.</br>If you want to purchase multiple CVMs, we recommend you select different availability zones to implement disaster recovery.</li></ul>For more information on regions and availability zones, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6091">Regions and Availability Zones</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Network</td><td>Required</td><td>A logically isolated network space built in Tencent Cloud. A virtual private cloud (VPC) includes at least one subnet. The system provides a default VPC and subnet for each region.</br>
If the existing VPC or subnet does not meet your requirements, you can create a VPC or subnet on the VPC Console.</br><b>Note</b>:<ul><li>resources in the same VPC can be shared within the private network.</li><li>When purchasing the CVM, ensure that the CVM and the subnet where the CVM is created have the same availability zones.</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Instance</td><td>Required</td><td>Tencent Cloud provides different instance types based on the underlying hardware. For optimal performance, we recommend you use instance types of the latest generation.</br>
For more information on instances, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/11518">Instance Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Image</td><td>Required</td><td>Tencent Cloud provides public images, custom images, and shared images. For more information on images, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4941">Image Types Overview</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">System Disk</a></td><td>Required</td><td>Used to install the operating system. Its default capacity is 50 GB.</br>Available Cloud Block Storage (CBS) types vary with regions. Please select a value as instructed by the page.</br>For more information on CBS, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">CBS Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">Data Disk</a></td><td>Optional</td><td>Used to scale up the storage capacity of the CVM to ensure high efficiency and reliability. CBS data disks are not added by default.</br>For more information on CBS, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31636">CBS Types</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Public Network Bandwidth</td><td>Required</td><td>A free independent public IP address is allocated by default.</br>Tencent Cloud provides two network billing modes. Configure a value greater than 0 Mbps as needed.<ul><li><b>Bill-by-bandwidth</b>: select a fixed bandwidth. Packet loss will occur when the bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where the network connection fluctuates slightly.</li><li><b>Bill-by-traffic</b>: billing is based on traffic that is actually used. You can specify a peak bandwidth to prevent charges incurred by unexpected traffic. Packet loss will occur when the instantaneous bandwidth exceeds this value. This is applicable to scenarios where the network connection fluctuates significantly.</li></ul><b>Note</b>: <ul><li>The allocated free independent public IP cannot be unbound from the instance. To unbind this IP address, first convert the public IP to an elastic IP. For more information on elastic IP, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733">Elastic IP (EIP)</a>. </li><li>An independent public IP address cannot be assigned in the following two cases. Please refer to the purchase page for the latest information.
<ul><li>The IP resources have been sold out</li><li>In certain regions</li></ul></li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td>Public Gateway</td><td>Optional</td><td>Applicable only to Linux images.</br>As a network interface between the VPC and the public network, the public gateway can forward requests of CVMs that are within different subnets of the VPC and have no public IP addresses.</br><b>Note:</b> Tencent Cloud discontinued configuring the public gateway on the CVM purchase page after December 6, 2019. To configure the public gateway, see <a href="https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34835">Configuring a Public Gateway</a>.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Quantity</td><td>Required</td><td>Number of CVMs to be purchased.</td></tr>

If multiple CVMs are purchased together, the custom data will run on all CVMs. The Linux operating system supports the Shell format while the Windows operating system supports the PowerShell format. A maximum of 16 KB of raw data is supported. For details, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17525">Configuring Custom Data (Linux CVM)</a>.</br><b>Note</b>: custom data configuration only supports certain common images with the Cloud-init service.
