## Overview
If you enable "No Charge when Shut Down" when shutting down a pay-as-you-go instance, the billing of CPU and memory resources of this instance stops. However the Cloud disks (system disk and data disk), public network bandwidth, images, and other key components of the CVM instance are still billed.
>! When this feature is enabled, the instanceâ€™s CPU and memory resources **will not be retained**, and the public IP address **will be automatically released** after shutdown. For more information about the feature, its use limits, and impacts, see [No Charges When Shut down for Pay-as-You-Go Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/19918).
