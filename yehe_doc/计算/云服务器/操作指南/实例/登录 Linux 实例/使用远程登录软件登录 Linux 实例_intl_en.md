## Overview

This document takes PuTTY as an example to describe how to log in to a Linux instance from Windows by using remote login software.


## Applicable OS

Windows

## Authentication Method

**Password** or **Key**

## Prerequisites
- You must already have the admin account and password (or key) of the instance to be logged in to.
 - If you use a system default password to log in to the instance, go to [Message Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/message) to obtain the password first.
 - If you forgot your password, please [reset your instance password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16566).
- A public IP has been purchased and obtained for your CVM instance, and port 22 is open (this is open by default for CVM purchased with quick configuration).
