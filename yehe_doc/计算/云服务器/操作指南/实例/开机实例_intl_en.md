### Starting up an instance via API
Use the [StartInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/33236) API to start up an instance.

## Subsequent Operations
Once the instance starts up, you can perform the following operations:
- **Log in to the instance**: depending on the instance type, you can login to the [Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436) or [Windows instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5435).
- **[Initialize cloud disks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/31596)**: format, partition, create a file system, or otherwise initialize the cloud disks mount to the instance.
