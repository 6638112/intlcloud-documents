2. In the **Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager** window, expand your server in the left sidebar, right-click **Website**, and select **Add FTP Site**, as shown in the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3d2c1a2708939cd5a8d7bf3bdf9aa1ff.png)
3. On the “Site Information” interface, enter the following information. Click **Next**, as shown in the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/76761e667657b80bfdd2d2403d64ba3c.png)
    - **FTP site name**: name of your FTP site. In this article, `ftp` is used.
    - **Physical path**: path of the shared folder. Make sure you set the appropriate permissions. In this article, `C:\test` is used.
4. On the **Binding and SSL Settings** interface, enter the following information. Click **Next**, as shown in the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/355c3de0e19d7e1c161c51156bf0965f.png) 
The following is a list of parameters:
     - **Binding**: the default option for IP addresses is **None assigned**; and the default port is port 21, the default FTP port number. You can choose your own port number.
     - **SSL**: select an option. In this article, **No SSL** is selected.
       - **No SSL**: does not support SSL connections.
       - **Allow SSL**: allow the FTP server to connect with clients with or without SSL.
      -  **Require SSL**: SSL encryption is required for communication between the FTP server and clients.
   If you choose **Allow SSL** or **Require SSL**, you can select an existing SSL certificate in “SSL Certificates”, or refer to [creating a server certificate](#ssl) to create an SSL certificate.
5. On the “Identity Authentication and Authorization Information” interface, enter the following information. Click **Next**, as shown in the figure below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0f3be2c7ba449240cdac3f3c767e668c.png)
 - **Identity authentication**: select an identity authentication method. In this article, **Basic** is used.
    - *Anonymous**: allow users access to the content without authentication.
	 -. **Basic**: require users to provide valid user names and passwords before allowing them to access the content. Under this mode, passwords are transferred without encryption. Therefore, select this authentication mode only when you know that the connection between the clients and FTP server is secure (for example, by using SSL).
 - **Authorize**: choose an option from the access permission drop-down list. In this article, `ftpuser` is used.
	    - **All users**: all users, anonymous or identified, can access the content.
	    - **Anonymous users**: anonymous users can access the content.
	    - **Specified role or user group**: only the specified roles or members of the specified groups can access the content. If you choose this option, you need to specify the roles or user groups.
	    - **Specified user**: only the specified user can access the content. If you choose this option, you need to specify the username.
 - **Permissions**: permissions to the shared content. In this article, **Read** and **Write** are selected.
    - **Read**: allow authorized users to read shared content.
    - **Write**: allow authorized users to write into the directory.
7. Click **Complete**.

### Step 6: configure security group and firewall
1. After the FTP site is created, add an inbound rule that allows traffic to the FTP port, which is 21 for the purpose of this article. For more information, refer to [Adding Security Group Rules](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34272).
If you selected other ports, you also need to add one inbound rule for each port selected.
2. (Optional) Refer to [Microsoft official documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.11/hh831655(v=ws.11)) on how to configure firewall so that the FTP server is able to accept passive connections from the firewall.

### Step 7: test the FTP site
You can use an FTP client, browser, or the file manager to connect to the FTP server. For the purpose this article, the file manager is used.
1. Configure Internet Explorer
 - If you have added the appropriate firewall rules, open an Internet Explorer window and select **Tools** -> **Internet Options** -> **Advanced**. Clear **Use Passive FTP (used for compatibility between the firewall and DSL modem)** and click **OK**.
 - If you did not add the appropriate firewall rules:
    1. Open an Internet Explorer window on **the FTP server** and select **Tools** -> **Internet Options** -> **Advanced**.  Clear **Use Passive FTP (used for compatibility between the firewall and DSL modem)** and click **OK**.
    2. Open an Internet Explorer window on the **client** and select **Tools** -> **Internet Options** -> **Advanced**. Clear **Use Passive FTP (used for compatibility between the firewall and DSL modem)** and click **OK**.
2. Open the file manager on your PC and type the following address in the address box of the browser and press **Enter**, as shown in the following figure.
```
ftp://CVM_public_IP_address:21
```
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/d3d5a93170bb990f47ecd9f24c3e89ab.png)
3. The **Login identity** dialog box appears. Enter the user name and password configured in [Creating FTP user name and password](#user).
In this article, the username is `ftpuser`, and the password is `tf7295TFY`.
4. Upload and download files after login.
