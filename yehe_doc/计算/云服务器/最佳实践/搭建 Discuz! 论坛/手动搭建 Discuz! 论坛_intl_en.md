## Overview

Used by over 2 million websites, Discuz! is the worldâ€™s most sophisticated and predominant forum software. This document describes how to create a website using Discuz! on Tencent Cloud CVM instance and deploy the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) runtime environment it needs.


To manually set up a Discuz! site, you should be familiar with common Linux commands (See [Installing Software via YUM under CentOS Environment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2046), and understand the usage and version compatibility of the software to be installed.
## Software
The following software is used to build a Discuz! website.
- Linux: Linux operating system. This document uses CentOS 7.6 as an example.
- Apache: Web server software. This document uses Apache 2.4.15 as an example.
- MariaDB: database. This document uses MariaDB 5.5.60 as an example.
- PHP: scripting language. This document uses PHP 5.4.16 as an example.
- Discuz!: forum software. This document uses Discuz! X3.4 as an example.


## Directions
### Step 1: log in to the CVM
See [Logging in to Linux Instance Using Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). You can also use other login methods that you are more comfortable with:

- [Log in to Linux Instances via Remote Login Tools](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502).
- Log in to Linux Instance via SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501)



### Step 2: set up the LAMP environment 

Tencent Cloud hosts a software repository containing CentOS official releases, which provides the most recent and stable version. Use Yum to quickly install CentOS.
