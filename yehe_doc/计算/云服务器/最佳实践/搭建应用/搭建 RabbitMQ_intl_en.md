## Overview
RabbitMQ is an open-source message broker based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP). It features usability, scalability, and high availability with an Erlang-programmed server, and supports multiple clients including Python, Ruby, .NET, Java, JMS, C, PHP, ActionScript, XMPP, STOMP, and AJAX. This document describes how to deploy RabbitMQ on Tencent Cloud CVM.

## Software
This document uses the following software as an example to deploy RabbitMQ:
- Linux: Linux operating system. This document uses CentOS 7.7 as an example.
- RabbitMQ Server: open-source message broker. This document uses RabbitMQ Server 3.6.9 as an example.
- Erlang: programming language. This document uses Erlang 19.3 as an example.


## Prerequisites
- A Linux CVM is required to deploy RabbitMQ. If you have not purchased a Linux CVM yet, see [Customizing Linux CVM Configurations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10517).
- The security group rules for the Linux instance have already been configured. Open the ports 80, 5672 and 15672. For more information, see [Adding Security Group Rules](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/34272).

## Directions
### Installing Erlang
1. See [Log in to Linux Instances Using the Standard Login Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436). You can also use other login methods that you are more comfortable with:
	- [Log in to Linux Instances via Remote Login Tools](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32502)
	- [Log in to Linux Instances via a SSH Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/32501)
1. Run the following command to install dependencies.
```
yum -y install make gcc gcc-c++ m4 ncurses-devel openssl-devel unixODBC-devel
```
2. Run the following command to download the Erlang installation package.
```
wget http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_19.3.tar.gz
```
3. Run the following command to decompress the Erlang installation package.
```
tar xzf otp_src_19.3.tar.gz
```
4. Run the following command to create the erlang folder.
```
mkdir /usr/local/erlang
```
5. Run the following commands in sequence to compile and install Erlang.
```
cd otp_src_19.3
```
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/erlang --without-javac
```
```
make && make install
```
6. Run the following command to open the profile configuration file.
```
vi /etc/profile
```
7. Press **i** to enter the editing mode, and append the following at the end of the file.
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/erlang/bin
```
8. Press **Esc** and enter **:wq** to save and close the file.

### Installing RabbitMQ Server
1. Run the following command to download the RabbitMQ Server installation package.
```
wget -P /root "https://www.rabbitmq.com/releases/rabbitmq-server/v3.6.9/rabbitmq-server-3.6.9-1.el7.noarch.rpm"
```
10. Run the following command to import the signature key.
```
rpm --import https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc
```
11. Run the following commands in sequence to install RabbitMQ Server.
```
cd
```
```
yum install rabbitmq-server-3.6.9-1.el7.noarch.rpm
```
12. Run the following commands in sequence to enable RabbitMQ autostart and start RabbitMQ.
```
systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
```
```
systemctl start rabbitmq-server
```
13. Run the following command to delete the default guest account of RabbitMQ.
```
rabbitmqctl delete_user guest
```
14. <span id="Step6"></span>Run the following command to create an account.
```
rabbitmqctl add_user Username Password
```
15. Run the following command to set the new account as the admin account.
```
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags Username administrator
```
16. Run the following command to grant the admin account all permissions.
```
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / Username ".*" ".*" ".*"
```


### Verifying installation
1. Run the following command to open the Web management page of RabbitMQ.
```
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
```
2. Open a browser and visit:
```
http://Instance public IP:15672
```
For more information about how to obtain the public IP address of the instance, see [Getting Public IP Addresses](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17940).
If you see the following page, it indicates that RabbitMQ has been successfully installed.
