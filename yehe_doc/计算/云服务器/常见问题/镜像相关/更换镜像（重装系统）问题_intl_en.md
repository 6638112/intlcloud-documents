### How long does it take to reinstall the operating system for an instance?

After the operation, reinstallation generally takes 10-30 minutes.

### What should I do if the re-installation is very slow or fails?

After the operation, reinstallation generally takes 10-30 minutes.

- If the re-installation is not completed after a long time less than 30 minutes, please wait.
- If the re-installation is not completed within 30 minutes or even fails, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact us.

### Will re-installation of operating system cause data loss?

After the re-installation, all data on the system disk of the server is cleared and the system disk is restored to its initial status. All data on the data disk of the server are retained but cannot be used until the data disk is mounted manually.
