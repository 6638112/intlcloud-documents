### I have purchased a Linux CVM with cloud disks over 20 GB. How will it be charged if I reinstall the operating system as Windows?

- The billing for the part exceeding 20 GB of the system disk previously purchased will stop once the Windows OS is successfully installed.

### I have purchased a Windows CVM with cloud disks. How will it be charged if I reinstall the operating system as Linux?

Because the capacity of the system disk cannot be reduced, it needs to be reinstalled at the current capacity with no additional charges. If you need to expand the system disk capacity after reinstalling the system as Linux, additional fees incur. For more information, see system disk expansion in [System and Data Disks](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/17351).
For more information on cloud disk prices, see [Pricing List](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/362/2413).
