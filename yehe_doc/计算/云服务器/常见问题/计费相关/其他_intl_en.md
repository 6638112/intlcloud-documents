### I have purchased a Linux CVM with cloud disks over 20 GB. How will it be charged if I reinstall the operating system as Windows?

### I have purchased a Windows CVM with cloud disks. How will it be charged if I reinstall the operating system as Linux?

Because the capacity of the system disk cannot be reduced, it needs to be reinstalled at the current capacity with no additional charges. If you need to expand the system disk capacity after reinstalling the system as Linux, additional fees will apply.
