### How do I view the operation logs of a CVM?

You can view the operation logs of a CVM in the upper right corner of the [Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/login?s_url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsole.cloud.tencent.com%2Fcvm).

### What if I cannot find my CVM on the console?

If your CVM is not shown on the console, verify the following:
1. Check the recycle bin to verify whether the instance has expired.Â·
2. Check whether the instance has been terminated because it has expired for more than 7 days.
3. Check whether you have selected a wrong project.

If none of the above applies, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact us.
