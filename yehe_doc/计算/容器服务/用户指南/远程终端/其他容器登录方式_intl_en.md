2. Log in to the node. For more information, see [Logging In to a CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436).
3. Run the `docker ps` command to view the target container.
```shell
[root@VM_88_88_centos ~]# docker ps | grep 75b3b15af61a  
75b3b15af61a       nginx:latest       "nginx -g 'daemon off"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute  k8s_worid.e8b44cc_worid-24bn2_default_81a59654-aa14-11e6-8a18-52540093c40b_42c0b746
```
4. 通过 `docker exec` 命令登录到容器。
```shell
[root@VM_0_60_centos ~]# docker ps | grep 75b3b15af61a
75b3b15af61a        nginx:latest                                 "nginx -g 'daemon off"   2 minutes ago       Up 2 minutes                            k8s_worid.e8b44cc_worid-24bn2_default_81a59654-aa14-11e6-8a18-52540093c40b_6b389dd2
