## Directions

<span id="createNode"></span>
### 新建节点

1. Click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** in the left sidebar to go to the "Cluster Management" page.
2. Click the ID of the cluster in which the CVM instance is to be created to go to the details page of the cluster.
3. Choose **Node Management** > **Nodes** in the leftside pane to go to the node list page. Then, click **Create a Node**.
4. On the "Select the Model" page, specify the billing method, availability zone, node network, and instance type as needed, as shown in the following figure:
![Select the model](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1b7044ca716512a7e3971f821d1cf866.png)
5. 单击【下一步】。
6. Configure the CVM on the "CVM Configuration" page, as shown in the following figure:
![CVM configuration](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/021ce75916acdb30e2d9fa3491c4efeb.png)
The following describes the main parameters:
 - Operating System: you can modify the operating system setting on the cluster details page. Nodes created or reinstalled after the modification will run the new operating system.
 - System Disk: select the local disk, HDD cloud disk, Premium Cloud Storage, or SSD cloud disk as needed.
 - Data Disk: select a data disk as needed.
 - Public Bandwidth: select "Bill-by-Bandwidth" or "Bill-by-Traffic" as needed.
 - Host name:
    - Auto-generated: the CVM instance will be automatically named in the format of ccs_cluster id_node.
    - Custom name: enter a custom CVM instance name with up to 60 characters.
 - Login mode:
    - Custom Password: set a password as prompted.
    - SSH Key Pair: a key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. Logging in to a CVM by using a key pair is more secure than using regular passwords. For more information, see [SSH Keys](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
    - Random Password: a password will be automatically generated and sent to you through Message Center.
 - Security Group: configure network access control for the CVM instance as needed. You can click **Create Security Group** to open other ports to the Internet.
6. 单击【下一步】。
7. On the "Confirm Information" page, confirm the configuration information, set the number of CVM instances, and click **Done**.

### Adding an existing node

>
>- Currently, you can add CVM instances only in the same VPC instance.
>- Do not add public gateway CVMs to the cluster. A DNS exception occurs when this type of CVM is reinstalled and added to the cluster, and the node becomes unavailable.

1. Click **[Clusters](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** in the left sidebar to go to the "Cluster Management" page.
2. Click the ID of the cluster to which an existing node is to be added to go to the details page of the cluster.
3. Choose **Node Management** > **Nodes** and click **Add Existing Node**, as shown in the following figure:

4. On the "Select Nodes" page, select the node to add and click **Next**.
5. On the "CVM Configuration" page, configure the CVM instance to add to the cluster.
The following describes the main parameters:
 - Data Disk Settings: select "Store containers and images on a data disk".
    - Set Later: no storage path is set for containers and images. This option is recommended if the system disk capacity is large, or a CVM without data disks is used, or data disks need to be manually mounted and used later.
    - Store containers and images on a data disk: set a storage path for containers and images if the system disk has a small capacity, or the used CVM has a data disk that permits formatting.
 - Operating System: you can modify the operating system setting on the cluster details page. Nodes created or reinstalled after the modification will run the new operating system.
 - Login Mode:
     - Custom Password: set a password as prompted.
    - SSH Key Pair: a key pair is a pair of parameters generated by an algorithm. Logging in to a CVM by using a key pair is more secure than using regular passwords. For more information, see [SSH Keys](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6092).
    - Random Password: a password will be automatically generated and sent to you through Message Center.
 - Security Group: configure network access control for the CVM instance as needed. You can click **Create Security Group** to open other ports to the Internet.
6. Click **Done**.
