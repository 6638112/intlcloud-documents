## Billing Mode

Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is billed in pay-as-you-go mode on a postpaid basis. The fees are calculated based on the configured amount of resources and the actual period of using them. Therefore, you do not need to prepay for EKS.

## Billing Method

EKS calculates fees based on the specifications of the CPU, GPU, and memory for a workload and the running time of the workload. For more information on the billing method, see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34055).

## Other Fees
If you use EKS with other paid products such as [CLB](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/clb), [CBS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cbs), and [CFS](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/cfs), these products are billed according to their own billing rules. For more information, see the purchase guide for the specific product.
