This document describes how to try out the recognition features in the [ASR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/asr). You can try out the recording recognition feature by directly uploading a file or using a URL. You can also try out the real-time speech recognition feature by scanning the QR code.

## Trying out Recording File Recognition

- **File Source:** you can upload a local file or use a URL. According to the requirements specified in the recording file recognition section in [ASR Details](https://cloud.tencent.com/product/asr/details#973919730), **the uploaded audio file cannot exceed 512 MB in size and 5 hours in length**.
- **Audio Category:** phone call and non-phone call scenarios are supported. Their recommended bit depth is 16. **The audio category must be the same as the uploaded audio for you to get the correct recognition result. If you don't know the audio attributes of a recording file, you can view them in common audio software programs such as Adobe Audition or the open-source command line tool FFmpeg.
 - Phone Call: audio generated by a mobile or landline phone call. The sample rate is generally 8,000 Hz by default.
 - Non-phone Call: audio not generated by a mobile or landline phone call. The recommended sample rate is 16,000 Hz.
- **Engine Model:** it can be selected based on the language and industry of your audio. If there is no engine model in the corresponding industry, we recommend you use a general model for recognizing the audio.
- **Result Style:** styles with or without timestamp are supported.
 - With Timestamp: the recognition result contains the start and end time of the corresponding audio segment.
 - Without Timestamp: the recognition result contains only text.
- **Recording File**: select a file/file address.
 - If you select **Local File** as **File Source**, click **Select File** to upload a local file.
 - If you select **URL** as **File Source**, you need to enter the URL of the audio.

After uploading the file, click **Start**. After recognition is completed, click **Click Download Result** to view the recognized content.
