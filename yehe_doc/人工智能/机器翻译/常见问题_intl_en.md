### What is machine translation？
Machine translation leverages the machine learning technology to translate the text from source languages to target languages supported by the system. It integrates several complicated cutting-edge technologies, including deep learning (AI), big data, linguistics, cloud computing, and APIs. The emergence of the neural machine translation (NMT) has brought fundamental transformation of translation technologies, making high-quality machine translation versions possible. NMT began to gain popularity among users and developers in the second half of 2016. Its translation accuracy depends on engines, algorithms, corpora, and iteration strength.
