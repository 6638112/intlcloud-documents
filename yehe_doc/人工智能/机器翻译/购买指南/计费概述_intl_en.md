All billable items of TMT are billed on a monthly basis, and the bill of all charges incurred in this month is issued within the first three days of the next month.

## Pricing
#### Published price
- Text translation is billed based on the characters translated every month, and a monthly stepwise pricing mode applies.
- The published price of text translation is 10 USD per 1 million characters.
- Each Chinese character, letter, punctuation mark, and space is counted as a character.

## Freezing
A bill for the current month will be generated within the first three days of the next month, and after it is settled, an amount equal to the number of calls in the current month x **published price** x 100% will be frozen in your account as the estimated fee for the next month. This frozen amount will be unfrozen during settlement in the next billing cycle.
