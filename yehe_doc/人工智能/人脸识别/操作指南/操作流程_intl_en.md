## Calling APIs
Face Recognition provides a full set of APIs. For more information, please see the [API documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1059/36941) of Face Recognition.
- We recommend using Tencent Cloud SDKs to call Face Recognition APIs. The SDKs are available in multiple programming languages, such as Python, Java, PHP, Go, Node.js, and .NET. You can download the corresponding SDK in the documentation of each service or get it from the [SDK Center](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/494).
- You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=iai&Version=2018-03-01&Action=DetectFace&SignVersion=), for online calls, signature verification, SDK code generation, quick API retrieval, etc.
- You can also call Tencent Cloud APIs through [TCCLI](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1013/33463) to manage your resources, implement automation, and manage scripts. This helps simplify services with complex APIs.
