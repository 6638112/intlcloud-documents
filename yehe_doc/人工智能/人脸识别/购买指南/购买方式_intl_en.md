# Purchase Method

The service is pay-as-you-go, so you do not need to purchase it. On the 1st to 3rd day of every month, the system will generate the bill for the previous month and automatically deduct the fees from your account balance. You can activate the service in the following steps:
1. Log in to the [Face Recognition Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/aiface).
2. Read the Terms of Service of Face Recognition and select the service to be activated.
