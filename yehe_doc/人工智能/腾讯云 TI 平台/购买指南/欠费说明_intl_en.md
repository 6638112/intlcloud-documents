## Overdue Payment Policy
Starting from the moment your account balance and frozen amount become negative:
* You can continue to use postpaid TI Platform resources for 2 hours, and we will continue to bill you for this period.
* After 2 hours, postpaid TI Platform resources will be automatically repossessed, and billing will stop.
