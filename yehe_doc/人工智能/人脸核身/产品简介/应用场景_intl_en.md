## Finance Industry
**Typical scenarios: bank account opening and insurance verification**

ID card recognition can be widely used in industries such as banking and securities where end user's identity requires verification to implement businesses such as remote account opening and large amount transfer, helping reduce bank's labor costs and improve user convenience.
Commercial insurance companies and social security institutions are often unable to verify the identity and existence of beneficiaries as they may not come on-site to complete the formalities in person for various reasons such as age and health condition. With the remote Faceid service, those organizations can effective avoid insurance fraud risks.

## Identity Registration
**Typical scenario: internet access in internet café and hotel check-in**

According to the applicable laws and regulations, identity registration is required in certain venues such as internet cafés. For example, when users want to surf the internet, they need to verify their identities at the front desk of the internet café. In this case, the front desk can call the Faceid service to verify their identities and register them after approval before granting the internet access.

## Telecommunications
**Typical scenarios: SIM card registration, activation, etc. with carriers**

To combat and prevent illegal and criminal activities conducted with SIM cards without identity verification, protect people's legitimate rights, and guarantee state security and social stability, users of phone services (including landlines, mobile phones, wireless internet access services, and broadband services) need to have their identity registered.
