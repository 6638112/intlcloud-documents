### Leading Algorithms
Tencent Cloud's face comparison algorithm has set records in multiple open international contests; for example, its recognition accuracy reaches 99.80% under the test of LFW (internationally recognized as one of the most challenging face image sets), leading the industry in terms of accuracy. In business scenarios, the true acceptance rate (TAR) of Faceid is over 98%, while the false acceptance rate (FAR) is 0.01%, which is also industry-leading.

### Security and Reliability  
With the aid of Tencent's many years of experience in security protection and big data security capabilities, the liveness detection technology of Faceid can block various attack means such as photos, videos, and static 3D models, providing high reliability and security for your business.
