## Product Overview
Tencent Cloud Faceid is a service kit that can verify the authenticity of user's face information. It provides various features such as liveness detection and 1:1 face comparison to satisfy diversified user identity verification needs in different industries like social security, finance, and insurance. 




## Features
### Liveness detection
Live detection is a technology developed for face recognition with high requirements for security. It can check whether the current user in the recorded selfie video is a real person and block attacks through various means such as photos, videos, and static 3D models. Currently, it supports multiple liveness detection modes such as lip language, motion, and video and can be applied in various verification scenarios.

### Face comparison
Face comparison can automatically verify a user's identity by calculating the similarity of facial features between two faces. Based on massive amounts of face data and cutting-edge technologies such as high-dimensional LBP, PCA, LDA-Bayesian, metric learning, transfer learning, and deep learning neural network, its detection accuracy can reach 99.80% as tested under LFW (a leading face comparison data set) in 2017. It supports recognition and verification in various scenarios and delivers excellent performance for different ages, postures, and lightness levels.
