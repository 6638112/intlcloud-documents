### Step 2. Apply for service activation

### Step 3. Use the service
You are recommended to use the [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=faceid&Version=2018-03-01&Action=DetectAuth&SignVersion=) tool for online test. It provides capabilities such as online call, signature verification, SDK code generation, and quick API search, significantly reducing the difficulty in using TencentCloud API 3.0. You can use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=faceid&Version=2018-03-01&Action=DetectAuth&SignVersion=) to generate the **server SDK** code and combine it with a developed Tencent Cloud SDK to quickly call the Faceid service. The server SDKs are available in multiple programming languages, including Python, Java, PHP, Go, Node.js, and .NET. You can download the corresponding SDK in the documentation of each service or get it from the [SDK Center](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/494).
