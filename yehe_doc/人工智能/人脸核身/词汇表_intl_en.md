### Liveness Detection
Live detection is a technology developed for face recognition with high requirements for security. It can check whether the current user in the recorded selfie video is a real person and block attacks through various means such as photos, videos, and static 3D models. Currently, it supports multiple liveness detection modes such as lip language, motion, and video and can be applied in various verification scenarios.

### Face Comparison
Face comparison can automatically verify a user's identity by calculating the similarity of facial features between two faces.
