TTS is pay-as-you-go by default after you activate its paid services.

## Pricing

### Pay-as-You-Go
By default, TTS charges you for its paid services on a pay-as-you-go basis.
TTS is billed by the number of processed characters at the following prices:

| Service | Unit Price (USD/10,000 Characters) |
|---------|---------|
| Synthesis of text to speech - standard voice | 0.125 |
| Synthesis of text to speech - premium voice | 0.185 |

## Billing and Payment Modes
### Pay-as-You-Go
TTS is charged by usage. All of its paid services are billed daily, which means that usage generated today will be billed and settled the next day.

| Billing mode | Pay-as-you-go |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Payment mode | Postpaid |
| Billing cycle | Daily |
| Use case | Businesses with greatly fluctuating or unpredictable usage |

## Fees Calculation Examples

### Pay-as-You-Go
If 1 million and 30 million characters are processed with standard voices and premium voices respectively in the current month, then the fees are as follows:
100 * 0.125 + 3000 * 0.185 = 567.5 USD

## Overdue Payment
If your account balance is negative, the TTS service will be suspended after 24 hours. Your data will be retained for seven days, and if you fail to top up your account to a **positive balance** within this period, your data will be terminated and cannot be recovered.

Once you receive an overdue payment reminder, top up your account in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/recharge) as soon as possible to prevent your business from being affected.
