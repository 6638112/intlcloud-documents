## Overview
This document describes how to use API 3.0 Explorer to debug TTS APIs online and quickly integrate the Tencent Cloud SDK corresponding to the APIs into your local project.

## Directions
### Activating TTS service
Before calling TTS APIs, you need to go to the [TTS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tts), read the User Agreement, select **I have read and agree to the User Agreement**, and click "Activate now".

After the service is successfully activated, you will get the free tiers of calls for each service, which can be viewed on the [Resource Package Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tts/resourcebundle) page. In addition, you can also purchase resource packages for various speech recognition service on the [TTS purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/tts). After the free tiers and number of resource package calls are used up, API calls will be billed in the pay-as-you-go mode and settled daily. For billing details, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1154/47874).

### Debugging TTS APIs
After the TTS service is successfully activated, go to the TTS [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=tts&Version=2019-08-23&Action=TextToVoice&SignVersion=) online API debugging page, select the API to be called, and enter the **input parameters**. You can view the specific descriptions of input parameters in the **Parameter Description** tab on the API 3.0 Explorer UI.

>- When you initiate a request in the online call module, the platform gets the temporary access keys of the current account through the information of the logged-in user and perform operations on the account.
>- Initiating a request is a sensitive operation, and you need to complete authentication for verification purpose. This operation is real and may incur fees. We recommend you carefully read the [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1154/47874) to learn more about fees.

After entering the **Input Parameters**, select the **Code Generation** tab, and you can see the automatically generated code in different programming languages (Java, Python, Node.js, PHP, Go, .NET, and C++), and some fields in the generated code are related to the entered content. If you need to adjust the input parameters, you can regenerate the code after modifying the parameter values on the left.

Select the **Online Call** tab and click **Send Request** to make a real request for your debugging and reference.

### Integrating TTS SDK
Confirm that your local dependent environment meets the following requirements:

| Programming Language | SDK Integration Requirements |
|---------|---------|
| Node.js | Node.js 10.0.0 or later |
| Python | Python 2.7 or 3.6â€“3.9 |
| Java | JDK 7 or later |
| Go | Go 1.9 or later (or Go 1.14 if go.mod is used) |
| .NET | .NET Framework 4.5+ or .NET Core 2.1 |
| PHP | PHP 5.6.0 or later |
| C++ | Compiler for C++ 11 or later, i.e., GCC 4.8 or later (currently, only the Linux installation environment is supported, while Windows is not) |
| Ruby | Ruby 2.3 or later |

Install the Tencent Cloud TTS SDK corresponding to the local dependent environment. The following takes Node.js as an example to describe the SDK installation and use methods.

#### Installation through npm (recommended)
Installation through npm is the recommended way to use the SDK for Node.js. npm is a dependency manager for Node.js that supports the dependencies your project requires and installs them into your project. For more information, visit [npm's official website](https://www.npmjs.com/).
1. Run the following installation command:
```
npm install tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs --save
```
2. Import the corresponding module code in your code. For more information, see the sample code.
3. The above import method downloads the SDKs of all Tencent Cloud products to your local system. You can replace `tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs` with a specific product SDK name such as `tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs-cvm/cbs/vpc` to import the SDK of the specific product. In the code, you can change `require("tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs")` to `require("tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs-cvm/cbs/vpc")` and keep the rest unchanged, which can greatly save the storage space. For more information, see the sample.

#### Installation through source package
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs) to download the source code package.
2. Decompress the source package to an appropriate location in your project.
3. Import the applicable module code in your code. For more information, see the sample code.

### Demo
After the SDK installation is completed, you can import the code automatically generated by API 3.0 Explorer into your project. Taking Node.js as an example, a simple demo is as follows:

```
const tencentcloud = require("tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs")

// Import the client models of the corresponding product module
const CvmClient = tencentcloud.cvm.v20170312.Client

const clientConfig = {
  // Tencent Cloud authentication information
  credential: {
    secretId: "secretId",
    secretKey: "secretKey",
  },
  // Product region
  region: "ap-shanghai",
  // Optional instance configuration
  profile: {
    signMethod: "HmacSHA256", // Signature algorithm
    httpProfile: {
      reqMethod: "POST", // Request method
      reqTimeout: 30, // Request timeout period in seconds, which is 60s by default
    },
  },
}
// Instantiate the client object of the requested product (with CVM as an example)
const client = new CvmClient(clientConfig)
// Call the API you want to access through the client object; you need to pass in the request object and the response callback function
client.DescribeZones().then(
  (data) => {
    console.log(data)
  },
  (err) => {
    console.error("error", err)
  }
)
```

In projects that support typescript, use the following method to call:

```
import * as tencentcloud from "tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs"

// Import the client models of the corresponding product module
const CvmClient = tencentcloud.cvm.v20170312.Client

const clientConfig = {
  // Tencent Cloud authentication information
  credential: {
    secretId: "secretId",
    secretKey: "secretKey",
  },
  // Product region
  region: "ap-shanghai",
  // Optional instance configuration
  profile: {
    signMethod: "HmacSHA256", // Signature algorithm
    httpProfile: {
      reqMethod: "POST", // Request method
      reqTimeout: 30, // Request timeout period in seconds, which is 60s by default
    },
  },
}
// Instantiate the client object of the requested product (with CVM as an example)
const client = new CvmClient(clientConfig)
// Call the API you want to access through the client object; you need to pass in the request object and the response callback function
client.DescribeZones().then(
  (data) => {
    console.log(data)
  },
  (err) => {
    console.error("error", err)
  }
)
```
The input parameters for instantiating `Client` support the `clientConfig` data structure. For more information, see [ClientConfig](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs/blob/master/src/common/interface.ts).
