**1. Terms and Definitions**

**1.1 Tencent Cloud Text Recognition Service**

Refers to each independent text recognition service within the text recognition product provided to you by Tencent Cloud, such as the ID Card recognition, general printed character recognition, and general handwriting recognition services.

**1.2 Service Month(s)**

Service Month(s) means the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you. For example, if you purchase the Service for a term of three months starting from March 17, there will be four (4) Service Months (the first Service Month from March 17 to March 31, the second from April 1 to April 30, the third from May 1 to May 31, and the fourth from June 1 to June 16). The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

**1.3 Failed Request**

The Service deems any request with an error code of “Internal Error” as a Failed Request.

**1.4 Valid Request**

The Service deems any request received by the server end of the Text Recognition Service as a Valid Request.

**1.5 Error Rate Per 5 Minutes**

Error Rate Per 5 Minutes = (Count of Failed Requests per 5 minutes / Count of all requests per 5 minutes) x 100%

**2. Service Availability**

**2.1 Calculation of the Service Success Rate**

The Service Availability of the Service is calculated on the basis of Service Months. The average of the Error Rate Per 5 Minutes is calculated by dividing the sum of Error Rate Per 5 Minutes within a Service Month by the total number of 5-minute periods in that Service Month, from which the Service Availability is then derived, i.e., 

Service Availability = (1 – The sum of Error Rate Per 5 Minutes in a Service Month / The total number of 5-minute periods in that Service Month) x 100%.

The total number of 5-minute periods in a Service Month = 12 x 24 x number of days in that Service Month

**2.2 Service Availability and Service Indicator Standard**

The Service Availability of the Service will be **no less than 99.5%**.

You are entitled to the compensation as set forth in Section 3 of this Agreement if the Service Availability fails to meet the aforementioned standard (other than in any circumstance as provided in the Release of Liabilities provisions).

**3. Compensation Plan**

In respect of the Service, if the Service Availability is lower than **99.5%**, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

**3.1 Standards of Compensation**

(2) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the abovementioned standard, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the applicable Monthly Service Fee paid by you for such Service Month** (the Monthly Service Fee referred to herein shall exclude the portion deducted by a voucher or promotional coupon, due to discounted service fee or otherwise deducted).

| **Service   Availability in a Service Month** | **Value of   Compensational Voucher** |

| Less than 95.0%                               | 100% of the   Monthly Service Fee     |
