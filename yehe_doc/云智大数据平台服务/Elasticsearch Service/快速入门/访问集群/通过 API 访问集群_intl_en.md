Elasticsearch provides full-featured RESTful APIs for intercalation with clusters. For more information, please see Elasticsearch's official [API documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/index.html).

As Tencent Cloud ES is deployed in your VPC, you can use a CVM instance in the same VPC as the client to access the ES cluster over the **private network** or **public network**. **Public network access has security risks**; therefore, please enable it with caution.

>Public network access is used for development and debugging only but cannot be used in the production environment, as the system limits the call frequency.

## Viewing Private/Public Network Access Addresses

On the [cluster list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/es) page, click a **cluster ID** to enter the cluster details page:
- The private address can be directly found in basic configuration. 
- The public network address is disabled by default for the sake of security. For clusters having [ES cluster user authentication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/35275) enabled, the public network address can be enabled. Doing so may bring security risks to the clusters, as it allows data in ES clusters to be accessed, manipulated, and even deleted directly through APIs; therefore, please enable it with caution.

## Testing Access
You can test access to clusters by running the `curl` command. The `ping` command is not supported for connectivity test.

### Testing service accessibility
>For clusters having [ES cluster user authentication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/35275) enabled, login requires authentication of username and password in the format of `curl action -u user:password host ...`, where `user` and `password` should be replaced with the actual username and password.
>
The following uses a private network access address as an example to describe the access operations.

Enter the following command:
```
curl -XGET http://10.0.17.2:9200
If ES cluster user authentication is enabled, remember to enter the username and password.
curl -XGET -u user:password http://10.0.17.2:9200
```
The following content is returned, indicating that the cluster can be accessed normally. The specific parameter values vary by cluster version:
```
{
  "name": "15589826570000*****",
  "cluster_name": "es-******",
  "cluster_uuid": "NGIm1M_zRw-L3o_gH****",
  "version": {
    "number": "6.4.3",
    "build_flavor": "default",
    "build_type": "zip",
    "build_hash": "fe40335",
    "build_date": "2019-05-17T14:22:47.286024Z",
    "build_snapshot": false,

    "minimum_index_compatibility_version": "5.0.0"
  },

}
```

## Creating Document

### Creating one document

- If user authentication is not enabled for the cluster, enter the following command:
```
curl -XPUT http://10.0.0.2:9200/china/city/beijing -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
"name":"Beijing",
"province":"Beijing",
"lat":39.9031324643,
"lon":116.4010433787,
"x":6763,
"level.range":4,
"level.level":1,
"level.name":"Tier-1 city",
"y":6381,
"cityNo":1
}
'
```
- If user authentication is enabled for the cluster, you need to **replace the `user` and `password` below with your actual cluster username and password.** Enter the following command:
```
curl -XPUT -u user:password http://10.0.0.2:9200/china/city/beijing -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
"name":"Beijing",
"province":"Beijing",
"lat":39.9031324643,
"lon":116.4010433787,
"x":6763,
"level.range":4,
"level.level":1,
"level.name":"Tier-1 city",
"y":6381,
"cityNo":1
