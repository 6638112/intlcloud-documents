ES comes with a Kibana module. You can access the Kibana page of your cluster to visually query, analyze, and manage your data. This tutorial is designed to help you get started with Kibana.

## Accessing Kibana Page
### Entries
There are two entries to the Kibana page, which are located on the cluster list page and the cluster details page, as shown below. Click either of them to jump to the Kibana login page.
>By default, Kibana is accessed at the public address. If you are concerned that accessing Kibana over the public network will cause security problems, you can disable the Kibana public address and enable the Kibana private address for access on the cluster details page (**this feature is not supported for clusters where all nodes are of the 1-core 2 GB MEM specification; instead, it is supported for hot/warm clusters where not all nodes are of the 1-core 2 GB MEM specification**).

### Login
To access the Kibana page, you need to log in with the username "elastic" and the Kibana password you set when you created your cluster. If you forgot your password, you can reset it on the cluster details page. For security reasons, you can configure an access blacklist/whitelist for the public address of the Kibana page. For more information, please see [Kibana Access Settings](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/16992).

- If "ES cluster user authentication" is not enabled, the Kibana login page is as shown below:

- If "ES cluster user authentication" is enabled, the Kibana login page is as shown below:

### Access
After logging in to the Kibana page, if you are a new user, your cluster has not stored any custom indexed data, and you will be prompted to configure an index. For more information, please see [Adding and Accessing Index](#jump).

## <span id="jump">Adding and Accessing Index (Storing Data)</span>

On the left sidebar on the Kibana page, click **Dev Tools** to enter the development tools page, where you can send various operation requests to your cluster through the console. The following shows how to manipulate your cluster and store data with sample city information.

### Adding index

#### Defining the mapping of index

Specify the index name as `china`, type name as `city`, and detailed field and type information. The type of the `location` field is `geo_point` which can represent location information, and `level` is the object type and contains subfield information. For more information on field types, please see [Field Datatypes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.4/mapping-types.html).

```
PUT china
{
  "mappings": {
    "city": {
      "properties":{
        "name":{ "type": "keyword"  }, 
        "province":{ "type": "keyword"  }, 
        "location": {"type": "geo_point"},
        "x":{ "type": "integer" },
        "level":{
            "properties":{                
                "level":{ "type": "integer" },
                "range":{ "type": "integer" },
                "name":{ "type": "keyword" }
            }
        },
        "y":{ "type": "integer" },
        "cityNo":{ "type": "integer" } 
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Adding one single document

### Accessing index
#### Configuring Kibana to access index
To use Kibana, you need to configure at least one index that can be matched. Enter the index `china` created above and click **Next step** to proceed to the next step:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/62c1496812dbab3bb7b9a87ec269929f.png)
You need to **configure a time filter field to filter** the data in an index by time. If there is no field in the index that indicates time, you can choose not to use the time filter feature. Click **Create index pattern** to create an index pattern:

## Visual Query and Analysis

Kibana can perform visual statistical analysis of data. Click **Visualize** on the left sidebar to configure various visual charts for data analysis. For example, to count the different levels under the `china` index mentioned above, follow the steps below:

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8cf36db4d3988ba69485719b650dd39e.png)
Select the `count` metric, aggregate the statistics by the `level.level` field, and click **Save**.
