## Overview

Combining cloud computing and community open-source technologies such as Hadoop, Hive, Spark, HBase, Presto, Flink, Druid, and ClickHouse, Tencent Cloud Elastic MapReduce (EMR) provides secure and cost-effective cloud-based pan-Hadoop big data architectures featuring high reliability and elastic scalability. A secure and reliable Hadoop cluster can be created in a matter of minutes to analyze petabytes of data stored on the data nodes in the cluster or in COS.

## Features

Completely derived from the open-source community, EMR enables you to seamlessly and smoothly migrate your existing big data clusters to Tencent Cloud. It is integrated with commonly used community components such as Hadoop, Hive, HBase, Spark, Presto, Sqoop, Hue, Druid, and ClickHouse, fully meeting your various needs like online big data business, offline/nearline data warehousing, and real-time stream computing.

EMR seamlessly incorporates the Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) service, allowing you to migrate files stored in HDFS to COS with unlimited scalability, low storage costs and high reliability for separation of computation and storage. With COS, a cluster can be created whenever needed and terminated after the task is completed without the concerns over data loss. In addition, the on-demand clusters can significantly reduce your big data processing costs.

EMR has five node types: master, core, task, router, and common nodes. For the purposes of each type, please see [Node Type Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1026/31094).

Currently, EMR supports multiple resource specifications, including Standard, Standard Network Optimized, MEM Optimized, High IO, Computing, Computing Network Enhanced, and Big Data models.
