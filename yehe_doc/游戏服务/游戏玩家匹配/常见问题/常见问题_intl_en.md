#### How does a game client initiate a matchmaking request?
Currently, a matchmaking request can be initiated only by calling the TencentCloud API. You need a server to process matchmaking requests from your players, and call TencentCloud GPM API to initiate matchmaking requests.

#### What rule types does GPM support?
Currently, GPM support rule types such as distance, comparison, collection, latency and distance sort. We plan to support more in the future.

#### Whatâ€™s the maximum number of players GPM supports for a single game session?
Currently, GPM supports matching up to 200 players in a single game session for a large match, and up to 40 players for a small match.

#### How can I get the matchmaking status and results?
There are two ways for you to do so: automatic event notifications, and manually calling the API for describing matchmaking progress. We recommend that you use the former method for better matchmaking performance.

#### How are matchmaking results processed?
GPM can automatically place matchmaking results into GSE to launch game server sessions, or you can process them by yourself.

#### Can I use GPM independently?
Yes, you can use GPM independently. However, we recommend that you use it with GSE for increased efficiency.
