### Use Case 2: Hosted Game Solutions

GPM can be used together with Tencent Cloud Game Server Elastic-scaling (GSE) to form a streamlined gaming solution, where matchmaking results can be used to request resources from the game servers hosted with GSE to automatically start new game sessions for matched players.

### Use Case 3: Matching Teams

GPM supports multiple matchmaking configurations within the same game. Developers can create sequential matchmaking rules to build teams and match battles. Players are first slotted into teams and then the teams are matched against each other.
