## Diverse Matchmaking Rules

GPM features a complex set of rule-based algorithms, enabling developers to configure matchmaking rules according to player attributes, latency, role preferences and more, satisfying the diverse matchmaking requirements of multiplayer games.

## Flexible Configuration

GPM supports defining and setting game attributes including values, strings and string maps in matchmaking rules. You can flexibly configure the number of teams and players, use different matchmaking conditions for different roles and decide when to relax matching rules so players can get in the game with minimal wait time.

## Streamlined Solution

You can opt to use GPM’s matchmaking service by itself, or integrate it with your game server for a streamlined solution where game resources will be requested according to matchmaking results. The latter enhances the gaming experience with better support for the life span of the game session.

## Ease of Use

GPM provides a diverse set of rule templates and syntax verification capabilities. You can use these templates to define a JSON script for the design and configuration of your matchmaking rules in the console easily, eliminating the need for complex code development.

## Cross-region Matching

GPM supports matching players based on latency, supporting multi-region/multi-server as well as cross-region server game architectures. Players are matched to servers with minimal latency, ensuring matched players from different regions have similar response time.
