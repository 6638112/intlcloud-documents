This document uses a rule as an example to describe how to slot players to team in GPM.

## Sample Rule

The following rule shows a complete match of players to one red and two blue teams. Each team has 3 players in a 3v3v3 battle structure.
```json
{
    "version": "v1.0",
    "teams": [{
        "name": "red",
        "maxPlayers": 3,
        "minPlayers": 3
    }, {
        "name": "blue",
        "maxPlayers": 3,
        "minPlayers": 3,
        "number": [2,2]
    }]
}
```

### Use case 1: team is not specified

- #### A single player initiates a match
Suppose the player A initiates a matchmaking request in which the `team` parameter is left empty, GPM may assign player A to red, blue 1, or blue 2 team. Then, the `team` parameter will be updated to "red_000", "blue_000", or "blue_001".


- #### Multiple players initiate a team match
Suppose players A and B initiate a team matchmaking request in which their `team` parameters are left empty, GPM will assign both players to the same team. Then, their `team` parameters will be both updated to "red_000", "blue_000", or "blue_001".


### Use case 2: team is specified

- #### A single player initiates a match
Suppose the player A initiates a matchmaking request in which the `team` parameter is specified to `red`, GPM will assign the player A to the red team. Then, the `team` parameter will be updated to "red_000".

- #### Multiple players initiate a team match
Suppose both players A and B initiate a team matchmaking request in which their `team` parameters are specified to `blue`, GPM will assign both players to blue 1 or blue 2 team. Then, their `team` parameters will be both updated to "blue_000" or "blue_001".

>! Currently, players cannot specify different teams in a GPM team match.
