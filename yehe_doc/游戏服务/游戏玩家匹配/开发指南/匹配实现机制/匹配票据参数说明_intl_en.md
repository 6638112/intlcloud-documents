This document describes GPMâ€™s MatchTicket parameters. For more information about relevant concepts, see [Glossary](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/38351#P).

## Status

MatchTicket status changes during the lifecycle of a matchmaking request. The updated status will be recorded in the **Status** parameter.

#### MatchTicket statuses

- **SEARCHING**: MatchTicket in this status indicates that GPM is searching for other satisfactory tickets in the match pool to be matched to this MatchTicket within the timeout period. If no ticket is found during this period, the MatchTicket status will change to **TIMEDOUT**.
- **PLACING**: MatchTicket in this status indicates that GPM is placing the matchmaking result of a complete match to the Tencent Cloud Game Server Engine (GSE) to start a new game server session in GSE. Only MatchTickets with a MatchCode configured to request resources from GSE will be in this status.
- **COMPLETED**: MatchTicket in this status indicates that a satisfactory match is completed, and its lifecycle in GPM ends.
    - For a MatchTicket without requesting battle server resources, this status indicates that the matchmaking request is completed.
    - For a MatchTicket automatically requiring battle server resources from GSE, this status indicates that the matchmaking request is completed and the matchmaking result is placed to the specified GSE server queue.
- **CANCELLED**: MatchTicket in this status means that the user cancels the matchmaking request at the **SEARCHING** stage.
- **TIMEDOUT**: MatchTicket in this status indicates that no satisfactory tickets are found for the matchmaking request within the specified timeout period at the **SEARCHING** stage. TimeOut is a MatchCode parameter that is defined when [a match is created](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39203).
- **FAILED**: MatchTicket in this status indicate that the matchmaking request fails due to internal error at the **SEARCHING or PLACING** stage.
