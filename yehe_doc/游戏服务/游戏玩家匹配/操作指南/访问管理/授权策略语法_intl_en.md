### Policy syntax

CAM policy:
```
{	 
        "version":"2.0", 
        "statement": 
        [ 
           { 
              "effect":"effect", 
              "action":["action"], 
              "resource":["resource"], 
              "condition": {"key":{"value"}} 
           } 
       ] 
} 

```
- **version** is required. Currently, only the value "2.0" is allowed.
- **statement** describes the details of one or more permissions, and therefore contains the permission(s) of other elements such as `action`, `resource`, `condition`, and `effect`. One policy has only one `statement`.
  - **effect** is required. It describes the result of a statement. The result can be "allow" or an explicit "deny".
  - **action** is required. It describes the allowed or denied operation. An operation can be an API (prefixed with “name”) or a feature set (a set of specific APIs prefixed with "permid").
  - **resource** is required. It describes the details of authorization. A resource is described in a six-segment format. Detailed resource definitions vary by product. For more information on how to specify a resource, see the documentation for the product whose resources you are writing a statement for.
  - **condition** is required. It describes the condition for the policy to take effect. A condition consists of operator, action key, and action value. A condition value may contain information such as time and IP address. Some services allow you to specify additional values in a condition.

### GPM operations

You can use CAM policy statements to authorize any API operations for any services that support CAM. To authorize GPM operations, please specify the APIs prefixed with "gpm:" such as `gpm:DescribeMatch` or `gpm:DescribeRule`.
To specify multiple operations in a single statement, separate them with commas as shown below:
```
"action":["gpm:action1","gpm:action2"]
```
You can also specify multiple operations using a wildcard. For example, you can specify all operations whose names begin with "Describe" as shown below:
```
"action":["gpm:Describe*"]
```
To specify all GPM operations, use only the wildcard `*` as follows:
```
"action":["gpm:*"]
```

### GPM resource path

Each CAM policy statement has its own applicable resources.
The general form of a resource path is as follows:
```
qcs:project_id:service_type:region:account:resource
```
- **project_id**: describes the project information and is only used to enable compatibility with legacy CAM logic. It can be left empty.
- **service_type**: describes the product’s abbreviation, such as `gpm`.
- **region**: region information, for example `ap-shanghai`.
- **account**: the root account of the resource owner, for example, `uin/164256472`.
- **resource**: describes detailed resource information of each product, such as `rule/RuleCode1` or `match/*`.

For example, you can specify a rule (rule-rzj1xxx) to specify the resource path in the statement as shown below:
```
"resource":[ "qcs::gpm:ap-shanghai:uin/16425xxxx:rule/rule-rzj1xxx"]
```
You can also use the wildcard (*) to specify all rules that belong to a specific account as shown below:
```
"resource":[ "qcs::gpm:ap-shanghai:uin/16425xxxx:rule/*"]
```
If you want to specify all resources or if a specific API operation does not support resource-level permission control, you can use the wildcard (*) in the `resource` element as shown below:
```
"resource": ["*"]
```
To specify multiple resources in one policy, separate them with a comma. In the following example, two resources are specified:
```
"resource":["resource1","resource2"]
```
The table below describes the resources that can be used by GPM and the corresponding resource description methods. In the following table, the words prefixed with $ are all alternative names.
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Resource</th>
<th>Resource Description Method in Authorization Policy</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Matchmaking</td>
<td><code>qcs::gpm:$region:$account:rule/$RuleCode</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Rule</td>
<td><code>qcs::gpm:$region:$account:match/$MatchCode</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

- “project” refers to project ID.
- “region” refers to region.
- “account” refers to account ID.
