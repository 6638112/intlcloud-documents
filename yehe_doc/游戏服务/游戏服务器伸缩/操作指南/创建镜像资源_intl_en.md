This document describes how to use image resources to create a server fleet.

## Prerequisites

- You already have a [Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cvm) instance.

## Directions

1 Upload game executable programs to the CVM instance under the path `/local/game/` so that GSE can launch the game process.
2. Log in to the [CVM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/instance/index?rid=1) and click **Instances** on the left sidebar to enter the instance management page.
3. On the instance management page, select the instance where game executable programs are uploaded to create image resources. For more information, see [Creating Custom Images](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/4942).
