## Overview

You can use GSE with [Game Player Matchmaking (GPM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39217) to establish a backend for your battle games. GPM provides player matchmaking services for battle games. With the custom matchmaking rules you set based on simple scripts, it can automatically search players for matchmaking and place game server sessions after the matchmaking is completed.

## Directions
When used together with GSE, GPM does not incur extra charges. For more detailed information on **GPM**, see [Matchmaking Requiring GSE Resources](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39217). You can also [independently use GPM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39218) services.
