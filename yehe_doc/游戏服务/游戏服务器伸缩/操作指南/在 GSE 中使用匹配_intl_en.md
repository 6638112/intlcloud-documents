## Overview

You can simultaneously use GSE and [Game Player Matchmaking (GPM)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39217) to establish a backend for your PvP games. GPM provides PvP game-based player matchmaking services. With the custom matchmaking rules you set based on simple scripts, it can automatically search players for matchmaking and place game server sessions after the matchmaking is completed.

## Directions
When used together with GSE, GPM does not incur extra charges. For more detailed information on **GPM**, see [Matchmaking Required to Request Battle Server Resources](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39217). You can also [independently use GPM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1072/39218) services.
