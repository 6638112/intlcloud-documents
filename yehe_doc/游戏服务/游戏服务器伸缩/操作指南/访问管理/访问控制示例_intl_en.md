## Overview

You can grant a user the permission to view and use specific resources in the Game Server Elastic-scaling (GSE) Console by using CAM policies. The examples below show how to do so.

## Directions

### Full access policy for GSE

To grant a user full permission to create and manage all GSE resources, associate the `QcloudGSEFullAccess` policy with the user.
The detailed steps are as follows:
1. Go to the [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy) page in the console, and click **Service Type**.
2. Search for this policy by selecting **Game Server Elastic-scaling** from the drop-down list, or by directly using the search box in the top right corner.

The policy syntax is as follows:

```
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "gse:*"
      ],
      "resource": "*",
      "effect": "allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

The above policy allows the user full access permission to GSE, including activating service, viewing statistics, and accessing asset packages, aliases, fleets, game server session queues, and any other resources.

### Read-only policy for GSE

To grant a user permission to query any GSE resources, but not create, delete, or modify them, associate the `QcloudCDBInnerReadOnlyAccess` policy with the user.
The detailed steps are as follows:
1. Go to the [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy) page in the console, and click **Service Type**.
2. Search for this policy by selecting **Game Server Elastic-scaling** from the drop-down list, or by directly using the search box in the top right corner.

The policy syntax is as follows:

```
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "statement": [
    {
      "action": [
        "gse:Get*",
        "gse:Describe*",
        "gse:List*",
        "gse:Resolve*",
        "gse:Search*",
        "gse:Check*"
      ],
      "resource": "*",
      "effect": "allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Policy for querying GSE service status

To grant a user the permission to query the status of GSE service, you can include the following operation in your policy, and then associate the policy with the user.

| Name | Description |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| CheckOpenStatus | Checks whether the service is activated or not |

The detailed steps are as follows:
1. Create a custom policy for querying GSE service status as instructed in [Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10601). The example policy syntax is as follows:

```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "action": [
                "gse:CheckOpenStatus"
            ],
            "resource": "*",
            "effect": "allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Find the created policy and click **Bind User/Group** in the "Operation" column.
3. In the pop-up window, select the user/group you want to authorize and click **OK**.

>!To initiate a GSE API request always requires the permission to the `CheckOpenStatus` API. Therefore, you must have `CheckOpenStatus` included in your custom policy. To do so, you can manually add it to each of your custom policies, or create a separate custom policy for this API like the example above, and associate it with any specific user.

### Policy for activating GSE service

To grant a user the permission to activate GSE service, you can include the following operation in your policy, and then associate the policy with the user.

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| SetOpenStatus | Activates GSE service |

The detailed steps are as follows:

1. Create a custom policy for activating GSE service as instructed in [Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10601). The example policy syntax is as follows:

```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "action": [
                "gse:SetOpenStatus"
            ],
            "resource": "*",
            "effect": "allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Find the created policy and click **Bind User/Group** in the "Operation" column.
3. In the pop-up window, select the user/group you want to authorize and click **OK**.

### Policy for viewing GSE statistics

| DescribeFleetStatisticSummary | Queries a summary of fleet statistics |
| ListFleets                    | Retrieves a fleet list        |

The detailed steps are as follows:

1. Create a custom policy for viewing GSE statistics as instructed in [Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10601). The example policy syntax is as follows:
