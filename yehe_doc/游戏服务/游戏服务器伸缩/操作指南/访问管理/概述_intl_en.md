Assume that you are using multiple Tencent Cloud services, such as Game Server Elastic-scaling (GSE), VPC and TencentDB. These services are managed by different users who all share your Tencent Cloud account key. Then, the following problems may exist:

 - Your key is shared by multiple users, which means your key runs a high risk of being compromised.
 - You cannot restrict the access permissions of other users, which poses a security risk due to potential misoperations.

These problems can be eliminated by the use of CAM, which allows you to authorize sub-accounts to manage your different services. By default, a sub-account has no access to GSE service or its resources. To grant a sub-account such access, you need to create a CAM policy. For more information on CAM, see [CAM Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10583).

A policy is a syntax specification that defines one or more permissions. It allows or denies the access to a specified resource by authorizing a user or a group of users.
For more information on CAM policy elements, please see [Element Reference](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10603).
For more information on how to use CAM policies, please see [Policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10601).

>?If you do not need to manage access permissions to GSE resources for sub-accounts, you can skip this part. This will not affect your understanding and use of other parts of the documentation.

## Getting Started

A CAM policy must permit or deny one or more GSE operations. Besides, you must specify some (or all) resources to operate on.

Some GSE APIs support resource-level permissions, which means that you can choose to specify either specific or all resources when calling these APIs.
