You can call GSE by the following the four steps below:
1. Integrate ServerSDK.
2. Publish the program integrated with ServerSDK.
3. Call a TencentCloud API (to create a game server session and a player session) and request the service address.
4. Access the service.

## Directions

6. Click **Redirect to client webpage** to access the page for connecting the client to the game server. Click **Connect**, and a message indicating that the server has been connected successfully will be displayed.
>This step connects the game service process through the IP and port returned by the TencentCloud API called in the last step. This step simulates the whole connection process. 




### Trying out auto scaling

#### Modifying the scaling configuration
1. Log in to the [GSE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gse) and click **Server Fleet** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the ID of the created server fleet to access the fleet details page and select **Expand/Reduce**.

3. Click **Modify** in the top-right corner to modify the scaling configuration items as follows:
 - Set the game server session buffer to 50%, i.e., when the number of game battles (sessions) loaded on the server exceeds 50% of the limit, expansion will be performed.
 - Set "Instance Range" to 0â€“3 so that there will be room for expansion.

4. After making the modifications, click **OK**.


#### Creating multiple game server sessions to trigger expansion

>
>- In the demo, one server is configured to sustain up to 10 game server sessions by default. When 5 game server sessions are loaded, the buffer utilization will be 50%.
>- Expansion will be required when there are more than 5 game server sessions. Therefore, you need to create 6 game server sessions to trigger expansion.

1. Select **Quick Trial** > **Deploy Demo Package** and click **Create Game Server Session** 5 consecutive times to create 6 game server sessions.

2. Click **[Server Fleet](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gse/fleet)** on the left sidebar, select the ID of the created server fleet to access the fleet details page, and select **Instance List**. Observe the instance quantity. After 2 minutes, you will see the number of servers increase to 2.

#### Ending game server sessions to trigger reduction
1. Select **Quick Trial** > **Deploy Demo Package** and create a player session for each game server session. Access the client page and click **End Game Session** to end a session. Repeat this operation 5 consecutive times to end 5 game server sessions.
2. Click **[Server Fleet](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gse/fleet)** on the left sidebar, select the ID of the created server fleet to access the fleet details page, and select **Instance List**. Observe the instance quantity. After 2 minutes, you will see the number of servers decrease to 1.
