## Overview

This document describes how to view a game server session, which corresponds to a server process. You can call a TencentCloud API to assign a game server session to a client, and GSE will assign this session to an idle process.

## Prerequisites

You have completed the [GSE Application Form](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/k0b6pvbhs6), your application has been approved, and you have created a server fleet.

## Directions

1. Log in to the [GSE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gse/asset) and create a server fleet. For more information, please see [Creating Server Fleets](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36675).
2. Click the **ID** of the created server fleet to enter the fleet details page. Click the **Game Server Session** tab to view details as below:
	- **Game Server Session ID**: it is automatically generated by the system by default.
