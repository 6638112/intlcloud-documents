## Overview
This document describes how to perform auto scaling for a server fleet.



## Preparations 
- You have integrated the [ServerSDK code package](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36674). You can also [use the demo package](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36678).
- You have [created a server fleet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36675).



## Directions
### Modifying the scaling configuration and the number of processes 
1. Log in to the [GSE Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gse/asset) and click **Server Fleet** on the left sidebar.
2. Click the ID of the created server fleet to access the fleet details page.
3. Click **Expand/Reduce** to access the scaling details page and click **Modify** in the top-right corner to modify the scaling configuration items:
 - Set the game server session buffer to 50%, i.e., when the number of game battles (sessions) loaded on the server exceeds 50% of the limit, expansion will be performed.
 - Set "Instance Range" to 0â€“3 so that there will be room for expansion.

### Creating a game server session and observing the expansion result
In addition to integrating the SDK into the code to call a TencentCloud API, you can also use [TencentCloud API debugging](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=gse) to quickly create a session.

After the game server session is successfully created through TencentCloud API debugging, you will see that it is generated in the server fleet.

In this step, one process is configured for one CVM instance by default. Therefore, after a game server session is created, the session utilization will be 100%. As the game server session buffer was set to 50% in the previous step, the number of instances will be automatically increased to 2.  



### Ending a game server session and observing the reduction result
After ending a game server session, the number of instances will be automatically decreased to 1.
