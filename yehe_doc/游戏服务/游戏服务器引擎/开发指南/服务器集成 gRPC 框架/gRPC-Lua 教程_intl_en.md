## Installing gRPC
1. Install gRPC. After installation, the `grpc_cpp_plugin` executable program will be generated, which will be needed for generating gRPC code.
2. Install protocol buffers.
 >?For more information on the installation process, please see [Installing gRPC Lua](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/BUILDING.md) and [Installing Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/src/README.md).

## Defining Service
 gRPC uses Protocol Buffers to define a service: an RPC service specifies methods that can be called remotely by using parameters and return types.
 >?We provide the .proto files for service definition. You can [click here](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/37419) to directly download them with no need to generate them by yourself.

## Generating gRPC Code
1. After defining the service, you can use protoc (protocol buffer compiler) to generate the client and server code (in any language supported by gRPC). 
2. The generated code includes the client stub and the abstract APIs to be implemented by the server.
3. Steps for generating gRPC code:
    The Demo for Lua relies on the C++ framework. Just like with the Demo for C++, in the `proto` directory, run:
 ```
 protoc --cpp_out=. *.proto``` 
 to generate the `pb.cc` and `pb.h` files.
 ```
protoc --grpc_out=. --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=`which grpc_cpp_plugin` *.proto```
to generate the corresponding gRPC code.
Move the 8 generated files to an appropriate location in the project.

#### Others

 When the game process uses gRPC to call a client API, you need to add two fields to `meta` of the gRPC request.

| Field      | Description                                      | Type   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------ |
| pid       | `pid` of the current game process                         | string |
| requestId | `requestId` of the current request, which is used to uniquely identify a request | string |

 1. Generally, after the server is initialized, the process will check itself to see whether it can provide services, and the game server will call the `ProcessReady` API to notify GSE that the process is ready to host a game server session. After receiving the notification, GSE will change the status of the server instance to "Active".
```
static bool luaProcessReady(std::vector <std::string> &logPath, int clientPort, int grpcPort) {
		GseResponse reply;
		// Log path. Set the ports
		Status status = GGseManager->ProcessReady(logPath, clientPort, grpcPort, reply);
		// Ready to provide services
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
			return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 2. After the process is ready, GSE will call the `OnHealthCheck` API to perform a health check on the game server once every minute. If the health check fails 3 consecutive times, the process will be considered to be unhealthy, and no game server sessions will be assigned to the process.
```
Status GameServerGrpcSdkServiceImpl::OnHealthCheck(ServerContext* context, const HealthCheckRequest* request,  HealthCheckResponse* reply)
{
		healthStatus = GSESDK()->exec("return OnHealthCheck()");
		std::cout << "healthStatus=" << healthStatus << std::endl;
		reply->set_healthstatus(healthStatus);
		return Status::OK;
}
```
 3. Because the client calls the [CreateGameServerSession](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/37139) API to create a game server session and assigns it to a process, GSE will be triggered to call the `onStartGameServerSession` API for the process and change the status of `GameServerSession` to "Activating".
```
Status GameServerGrpcSdkServiceImpl::OnStartGameServerSession(ServerContext* context, const StartGameServerSessionRequest* request,  GseResponse* reply)
{
		auto gameServerSession = request->gameserversession();
		GGseManager->SetGameServerSession(gameServerSession);

		std::ostringstream o;
		o << "return OnStartGameServerSession('" << gameServerSession.gameserversessionid() << "'," << gameServerSession.maxplayers() << ")";
		std::string luaCmd = o.str();

		bool res = GSESDK()->exec(luaCmd);

		return Status::OK;
}
```
 4. After the game server receives `onStartGameServerSession`, you need to handle the logic or resource allocation by yourself. After everything is ready, the game server will call the `ActivateGameServerSession` API to notify GSE that the game server session has been assigned to a process and is ready to receive player requests and will change the server status to "Active".
```
static bool luaActivateGameServerSession(const std::string &gameServerSessionId, int maxPlayers) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->ActivateGameServerSession(gameServerSessionId, maxPlayers, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 5. After the client calls the [JoinGameServerSession](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/37132) API for the player to join, the game server will call the `AcceptPlayerSession` API to verify the validity of the player. If the connection is accepted, the status of `PlayerSession` will be set to "Active". If the client receives no response within 60 seconds after calling the `JoinGameServerSession` API, it will change the status of `PlayerSession` to "Timeout" and then call `JoinGameServerSession` again.
```
static bool luaAcceptPlayerSession(const std::string &gameServerSessionId, const std::string &playerSessionId) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->AcceptPlayerSession(gameServerSessionId, playerSessionId, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 6. After the game ends or the player exits, the game server will call the `RemovePlayerSession` API to remove the player, change the status of `playersession` to "Completed", and reserve the player location in the game server session.
```
static bool luaRemovePlayerSession(const std::string &gameServerSessionId, const std::string &playerSessionId) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->RemovePlayerSession(gameServerSessionId, playerSessionId, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 7. After a game server session (a game battle or a service) ends, the game server will call the `TerminateGameServerSession` API to end the `GameServerSession` and change its status to `Terminated`.
```
static bool luaTerminateGameServerSession(const std::string &gameServerSessionId) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->TerminateGameServerSession(gameServerSessionId, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 8. In case of health check failure or reduction, GSE will call the `OnProcessTerminate` API to end the game process. The reduction will be triggered according to the [protection policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36675#test12) configured in the GSE Console.
```
Status GameServerGrpcSdkServiceImpl::OnProcessTerminate(ServerContext* context, const ProcessTerminateRequest* request,  GseResponse* reply)
{
		auto terminationTime = request->terminationtime();
		std::to_string(terminationTime));
		std::ostringstream o;
		o << "OnProcessTerminate(" << terminationTime << ")";
		std::string luaCmd = o.str();

		GSESDK()->execWithNilResult(luaCmd);

		return Status::OK;
}
```
 9. The game server calls the `ProcessEnding` API to end the process immediately, change the server process status to "Terminated", and repossess the resources.
```
// Active call: a game battle corresponds to a process. The `ProcessEnding` API will be actively called after the game battle ends
// Passive call: in case of reduction, process exception, or health check failure, the `ProcessEnding` API will be called passively according to the protection policy. If a full protection or time-period protection policy is configured, it is required to determine whether there are any players in the game server session before the passive call can be made
static bool luaProcessEnding() {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->ProcessEnding(reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 10. The game server calls the `DescribePlayerSessions` API to get the information of the player in the game server session (which is optional based on your actual business needs).
```
static bool luaDescribePlayerSessions(const std::string &gameServerSessionId, 
											const std::string &playerId,
											const std::string &playerSessionId,
											const std::string &playerSessionStatusFilter, const std::string &nextToken,
                                            int limit) {
		DescribePlayerSessionsResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->DescribePlayerSessions(gameServerSessionId,playerId, playerSessionId, playerSessionStatusFilter, nextToken, limit, reply);
		
		GSESDK()->setDescribePlayerSessionsResponse(reply);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 11. The game server calls the `UpdatePlayerSessionCreationPolicy` API to update the player session creation policy and set whether to accept new players, i.e., whether to allow new players to join a game session (which is optional based on your actual business needs).
```
static bool luaUpdatePlayerSessionCreationPolicy(const std::string &newpolicy) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->UpdatePlayerSessionCreationPolicy(newpolicy, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```
 12. The game server calls the `ReportCustomData` API to notify GSE of the custom data (which is optional based on your actual business needs).
```
static bool luaReportCustomData(int currentCustomCount, int maxCustomCount) {
		GseResponse reply;
		Status status = GGseManager->ReportCustomData(currentCustomCount, maxCustomCount, reply);
		GSESDK()->setReplyStatus(status);
		if (!status.ok()) {
				return false;
		}
		return true;
}
```

## Launching Server for GSE to Call

Server running: launch `GrpcServer`.
```
// Launch the gRPC server
    std::thread tGrpc(&GameServerGrpcSdkServiceImpl::StartGrpcServer, GGameServerGrpcSdkService);
    sem_wait(&(GGameServerGrpcSdkService->sem));
    auto grpcPort = GGameServerGrpcSdkService->GetGrpcPort();
```

## Connecting Client to gRPC Server of GSE
Server connecting: create a gRPC channel, specify the host name and server port to connect to, and use this channel to create a stub instance.
```
void GseManager::InitStub() {
        auto channel = grpc::CreateChannel("127.0.0.1:5758", grpc::InsecureChannelCredentials());
        stub_ = GseGrpcSdkService::NewStub(channel);
}
```

## Demo for Lua
 1. [Click here](https://gsegrpcdemo-1301007756.cos.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com/lua-demo.zip) to download the code of the Demo for Lua.
 2. Generate the gRPC code.
The Demo for Lua relies on the C++ framework, and the generated gRPC code is in the `cpp-demo/source/grpcsdk` directory, so there is no need to generate it again.
 3. Launch the server for GSE to call.
  - Implement the server.
`grpcserver.cpp` in the `lua-demo/source/api` directory implements three server APIs.
  - Run the server.
`main.cpp` in the `lua-demo` directory launches `GrpcServer`.
 4. Connect the client to the gRPC server of GSE.
  - Implement the client.
`GSESdkHandleWrapper.cpp` in the `lua-demo/source/lua` directory implements nine client APIs.
  - Connect to the server.
Create a gRPC channel, specify the host name and server port to connect to, and use this channel to create a stub instance.
 5. Compile and run.
  1. Install CMake.
  - Install GCC above v4.9.
  - Install the LuaJIT and Boost development kits:
 ```
yum install -y luajit-devel
yum install -y boost-devel
yum install -y cmake
 ```
  - Download the code and run the following command in the `lua-demo` directory:
 ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   cp ../source/lua/gse.lua .
 ```
  The corresponding `lua-demo` executable file will be generated. Run `./lua-demo` to launch.
  - Package the executable file `lua-demo.cpp` as an [asset package](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36674) and configure the launch path as `lua-demo` with no launch parameter needed.
  - [Create a server fleet](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/36675) and deploy the asset package on it. After that, you can perform various operations such as [scaling](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1055/37445).
