## Downloading SDK 
#### 1. Download address
Please download the relevant demo and SDK in the [SDK Download Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18521).

#### 2. Preparations for access
To access the SDK, you need to use the `AppID` and related permission keys provided by Tencent Cloud, i.e., the `AppID` in the application management list and the authentication information in the application settings.

For more information on platform-specific configurations, please see the project configuration document for the platform.

#### 3. Usage tips for official demo
The demo has a Tencent Cloud test account for functionality trial. If you want to use your personal or corporate test account, you need to replace the `AppID` of the Tencent Cloud test account on the corresponding page of the demo with the `AppID` you get in the console and change the permission key of voice chat in the `AVChatViewController-GetAuthBuffer` function.
