### After the API for voice file uploading is called successfully, the `fileid` in the returned value is a URL. How do I use it?
Call the API for file downloading and use this URL to download the file. Specifically, the `fileid` called back upon file upload completion needs to be sent to the server, and other clients can get the voice message through the `fileid`.

### What should I do if it takes too long to upload or download an offline recording file?
For the voice messaging and speech-to-text service, if the conversion delay is too high, you are recommended to use the streaming recording API which calls back the returned text.
