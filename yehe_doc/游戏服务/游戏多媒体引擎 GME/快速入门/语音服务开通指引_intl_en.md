>- The permission key here will be used as a parameter when accessing the SDK. 
>- Change of the key on this page takes effect within 15 minutes to 1 hour. It is not recommended to change it frequently.
>- Only the account that creates the game, root account, and global collaborators can **reset the key**.
>- For more information about authentication, see [Authentication Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/12218).
