## 2. GME Billing Modes

GME currently provides multiple services, such as voice chat, voice messaging, and speech-to-text features. For billing details, see [Pay-as-You-Go Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/36276).

## 3. Free Demo

You can scan the QR code in [Free Demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/38535) to download the mobile application or download the executable program for the Windows platform to experience the 3D sound effect.

## 4. Getting Started

#### 4.1 Activate the service

Before using GME, you need to [sign up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) and activate the GME service. For more information, please see [Voice Service Activation Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/39698).

#### 4.2 Obtaining the access parameter

After activating the GME service, you can find the AppID and permission key in the details page of the created application.
- The AppID and permission key are required in the Demo as parameters.
- During the usage of SDK, the initialization API “Init” needs to use AppID as a parameter. The authentication APIs “QAVAuthBuffer.GenAuthBuffer” (voice chat) and “ApplyPTTAuthbuffer” (speech-to-text) all require permission key as parameters.

#### 4.3 Downloading SDK

You can download the GME SDKs for different platforms. For details, see [SDK Download Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18521). **Currently, GME supports Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, and GSE supports UnrealEngine4, Unity3D, and Cocos2DX**.

GME supports the real-time audio call on H5 .

#### 4.4 Accessing SDK
To access the SDK of each platform, you can refer to the [project configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/10783) document of each platform to configure the project, and then check the [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/15228) of the corresponding platform to call the APIs to use GME services. The calling sequence of voice chat APIs is **Init API (for initialization)** > **Poll API (for callback trigger)** > **EnterRoom API (for entering a voice chat room)** > **EnableMic API (for enabling the mic)** > **EnableSpeaker API (for enabling the speaker)** > **ExitRoom API (for exiting the room)** > **Unit API (for uninitialize)**.

**The room entry process of voice chat is shown as follows:**
