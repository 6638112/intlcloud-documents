## Equalizer instructions

>! This document is for guidance only. 

The sound range of human is roughly between 20 Hz and 20 kHz. The perception of each frequency band presents a logarithmic relationship, so the mixing project often divides the human audible frequency band into 10 octaves, which are divided into the following areas:

| Band | Zone | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
|  20 Hz – 32 Hz | Infrasound and subwoofer zone | Most of the frequency band in this zone is below the lower limit of the huaman hearing. Music in the super-large pipe organ and the film of the explosion and thunder sound effects can reach this frequency, while the human voice can not. Generally, VOIP calls are recommended to be tuned to z minimum to remove DC interference and leave the signal energy for other frequency bands.|
|  32 Hz – 64 Hz | <nobr>Heavy bass zone</nobr> | It is mainly used to adjust the dive of the drums and bass. The tone is not obvious, which can be reached by part of the baritone. It is recommended to tune down the VoIP call to remove industrial frequency interference and leave the energy for other frequency bands.|
| 64 Hz - 125 Hz | Bass zone | It is the range of the base clock of most orchestral instruments, which also determines the strength of the percussion. |
|  <nobr>125 Hz - 250 Hz</nobr> | Bass zone | It is the range of the base clock of the human voice, which determines the perception of the human voice tone. If it is too heavy, it will lead to a slurred sound. |
|  250 Hz—500 Hz | Mid-bass zone | It contains important lower harmonics of the tone in the frequency band, which can be used to adjust the tone and the enhancement of this section makes the tone warm and thick, while excessive enhancement makes it slurred. |
| 500 Hz – 1 kHz | Midrange | It is used to adjust the female voice tone to make it fuller. Note that if it is too high, it will lead to a heavy nasal sound. Cell phones and other mobile playback devices resonance peak in this band, so please don’t make it too high. |
|  1 kHz – 2 kHz | Midrange | It is a sensitive area of the human ear. The value affects the loudness and sense of presence, so it is recommended to enhance.|
|  2 kHz-4 kHz | Soprano zone | It is the most sensitive area of human ear. The enhancement can increase the loudness of the voice and improve the intelligibility. Note that if it is too high, the sibilant could be heavy. |
|  4 kHz – 8 kHz | Soprano zone | It can show the details of high frequency instruments, for example, cymbals and string instruments. Besides, it can decide details of voice, such as labiodental and fricative. Adjustment is not recommended.          |
| 8 kHz - 16 kHz | Super treble and super voice zone | It is the high frequency overtones area of the instrument. The adjustment has little effect on the voice. |
