## Overview

The GME SDK for iOS has been upgraded to v2.9. To implement this upgrade, perform the following steps in your project:



## Upgrade Directions

### 1. Download the SDK 

In the new version, the dynamic libraries of the SDK are split into the following files:

- libgmefdkaac.framework
- libgmeogg.framework
- libgmelamemp3.framework
- libgmesoundtouch.framework

Make sure that the downloaded SDK contains these files. After downloading, put them together with `GMESDK.framework` in the project directory. `Release-iphoneos` is the SDK file used for real devices, while `Release-iphonesimulator` is the SDK file used for simulators.

### 4. Modify the rpath

You need to add `@executable_path/Frameworks` in the `rpath`. If it has already been added, there is no need for modification.
