This document describes how to integrate with Game Multimedia Engine (GME) on macOS.



<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
This document applies to GME SDK version 2.9.
</dx-alert>



## Considerations

GME provides two services: voice chat service and voice message and speech-to-text service, both of which rely on key APIs such as Init and Poll.

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="Note on Init API">
If you need to use voice chat and voice message services at the same time, **you only need to call `Init` API once**.
Billing will not start after initialization. After you call <dx-tag-link link="#EnterRoom" tag="API: EnterRoom">Entering a voice chat room</dx-tag-link> to enter the room successfully, the billing will start.
</dx-alert>

### Important notes
- Configure your project before using GME; otherwise, the SDK will not take effect.
- After a GME API is called successfully, `QAVError.OK` will be returned with the value being 0.
- GME APIs should be called in the same thread.
- The `Poll` API should be called periodically for GME to trigger event callbacks.
- For detailed error code, please see <dx-tag-link link="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/33223" tag="ErrorCode">Error Codes</dx-tag-link>.

### APIs

```
@class ITMGRoom;//Room APIs
@class ITMGAudioCtrl;//Audio APIs
@class ITMGAudioEffectCtrl;//Sound effect, accompaniment APIs
```

## Key APIs

Before the initialization, the SDK is in the uninitialized status, and **you need to initialize it through the `Init` API** before you can use the voice chat and speech-to-text services.

**You need to call the `Init` API before calling any APIs of GME.**


If you have any questions when using the service, please see [General FAQs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/30254).



|API     | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| InitEngine | Initializes GME |
| Poll | Triggers event callback |
| Pause | Pauses the system |
| Resume | Resumes the system |
| Uninit | Uninitializes GME |

### Getting singleton
To use the voice feature, get the `ITMGContext` object first.
#### Function prototype 

```
ITMGContext ITMGDelegate <NSObject>
```



#### Sample code  

```
ITMGContext* _context = [ITMGContext GetInstance];
_context.TMGDelegate =self;
```

### Message delivery

The API callback messages is processed in `OnEvent`. For the message type, please see `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE`. The message content is a dictionary for parsing the API callback contents.

#### Function prototype 

```
- (void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary*)data;
```


#### Sample code  
```
-(void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary *)data{
    	NSLog(@"OnEvent:%lu,data:%@",(unsigned long)eventType,data);
		switch (eventType) {
			//Identify `eventType`
			}
	}
```



### [Initializing SDK](id:Init)

- This API is used to initialize the GME service. It is recommended to call it when initializing the application. No fee is incurred for calling this API.
- For more information on how to get the `sdkAppID` parameter, see [Voice Service Activation Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/10782#.E9.87.8D.E7.82.B9.E5.8F.82.E6.95.B0).
- The openID uniquely identifies a user with the rules stipulated by the application developer and unique in the application (currently, only INT64 is supported).



<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
- The SDK must be initialized before a user can enter a voice chat room.
- The Init API must be called in the same thread with other APIs. It is recommended to call all APIs in the main thread.
</dx-alert>



#### Function prototype

```
-(int)InitEngine:(NSString*)sdkAppID openID:(NSString*)openID;
```

| Parameter     |  Type  | Description                                                         |
| -------- | :----: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| sdkAppId | String | `AppId` provided by the GME service from the [Tencent Cloud console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gamegme) |
| OpenId |String | `OpenId` can only be in Int64 type, which is passed after being converted to a string. |


#### Returned values
| Returned Value | Description |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| QAV_OK= 0 | Initialized SDK successfully. |
| QAV_ERR_SDK_NOT_FULL_UPDATE= 7015 | Checks whether the SDK file is complete. It is recommended to delete it and then import the SDK again. |

The returned value `AV_ERR_SDK_NOT_FULL_UPDATE` is **only a reminder** but will not cause an initialization failure.

- If this error is reported during integration, please check the integrity and version of the SDK file as prompted.
- If this error is returned after executable file export, please ignore it and try to avoid displaying it in the UI.

#### Sample code 


```
_openId = _userIdText.text;
_appId = _appIdText.text;
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] InitEngine:SDKAPPID openID:_openId];

```


### [Triggering event callback](id:Poll)

Event callbacks can be triggered by periodically calling the `Poll` API in `update`. The `Poll` API should be called periodically for GME to trigger event callbacks; otherwise, the entire SDK service will run exceptionally.
Refer to the EnginePollHelper.m file in [Demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18521).

<dx-alert infotype="alarm" title="Calling the `Poll` API periodically">
The `Poll` API must be called periodically and in the main thread to avoid abnormal API callbacks.
</dx-alert>

#### Function prototype

```
-(void)Poll;
```

#### Sample code

```
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] Poll];
```

### Pausing the system

When a `Pause` event occurs in the system, the engine should also be notified for pause.
If you need to pause the audio when switching to the background, you can call the `Pause` API in the listening code used to switch to the background, and call the `Resume` API in the listening event used to resume the foreground.

#### Function prototype

```
-(QAVResult)Pause;
```

### Resuming the system

When a `Resume` event occurs in the system, the engine should also be notified for resumption. The `Resume` API only supports resuming voice chat.

#### Function prototype

```
-(QAVResult)Resume;

```



### [Uninitializing SDK](id:UnInit)

This API is used to uninitialize the SDK to make it uninitialized. **Switching accounts requires uninitialization**.

#### Function prototype

```
-(int)Uninit;
```
#### Sample code
```
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] Uninit];
```


### Voice chat flowchart

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/28a13d4beccdfecb0ad7530008ec8da0.png)

## Voice Chat Room APIs

You should initialize and call the SDK to enter a room before voice chat can start.
If you have any questions when using the service, please see [FAQs About Voice Chat](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/39524).

| API | Description |
| -------------- | :------------------: |
| GenAuthBuffer | Initializes authentication |
| EnterRoom | Enters room |
| IsRoomEntered | Indicates whether room entry is successful |
| ExitRoom | Exits room |
| ChangeRoomType | Modifies user's room audio type |
| GetRoomType | Gets user's room audio type |

### Voice chat room call flowchart

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2b5d8f7f7f4b4b3fbce8c9ebf01f78d8.png)

<dx-alert infotype="alarm" title="Entered the room successfully">
If the room entry callback result is 0, the room entry is successful. The returned value of 0 from the `EnterRoom` API does not necessarily mean that the room entry is successful.
</dx-alert>

### Authentication information

Generate `AuthBuffer` for encryption and authentication of relevant features. For release in the production environment, please use the backend deployment key as detailed in [Authentication Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/12218).    


#### Function prototype

```
@interface QAVAuthBuffer : NSObject
+ (NSData*) GenAuthBuffer:(unsigned int)appId roomId:(NSString*)roomId openID:(NSString*)openID key:(NSString*)key;
+ @end

```

| Parameter   |   Type   | Description                                                         |
| ------ | :------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| appId | int | `AppId` from the Tencent Cloud console.|
| roomId | NSString | Room ID, which can contain up to 127 characters. |
| openID | NSString | User ID, which is the same as `openID` during initialization. |
| key | NSString | Permission key from the Tencent Cloud [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gamegme). |



#### Sample code  

```
#import "GMESDK/QAVAuthBuffer.h"
NSData* authBuffer = [QAVAuthBuffer GenAuthBuffer:SDKAPPID3RD.intValue roomId:_roomId openID:_openId key:AUTHKEY];

```



###  [Entering a room](id:EnterRoom)

When a user enters a room with the generated authentication information, the `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_ROOM` message will be received as a callback. Mic and speaker are not enabled by default after room entry. The returned value of `AV_OK` indicates a success.

The audio type of the room is determined by the first user to enter the room. After that, if a member in the room changes the room type, it will take effect for all members there. For example, if the first user entering the room uses the smooth sound quality, and the second user entering the room uses the HD sound quality, the room audio type of the second user will become smooth sound quality. Only when a member in the room calls the `ChangeRoomType` API, the audio type of the room will be changed.

For more information on how to choose a room audio type, please see [Sound Quality Selection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/18522).

#### Function prototype

```
-(int)EnterRoom:(NSString*) roomId roomType:(int)roomType authBuffer:(NSData*)authBuffer;

```

| Parameter       |   Type   | Description                    |
| ---------- | :------: | ----------------------- |
| roomId | NSString | Room ID, which can contain up to 127 characters |
| roomType | int | Room audio type |
| authBuffer | NSData | Authentication key |




#### Sample code  

```
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] EnterRoom:_roomId roomType:_roomType authBuffer:authBuffer];

```

### Callback for room entry

After the user enters the room, the message `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_ROOM` will be sent and identified in the `OnEvent` function for callback and processing. A successful callback means that the room entry is successful, and the billing starts.

<dx-fold-block title="Billing references">
[Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/36276)
[Billing FAQs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/30255)
[Will the billing continues if the client goes offline when using Voice Chat?](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/30255#.E4.BD.BF.E7.94.A8.E5.AE.9E.E6.97.B6.E8.AF.AD.E9.9F.B3.E5.90.8E.EF.BC.8C.E5.A6.82.E6.9E.9C.E5.AE.A2.E6.88.B7.E7.AB.AF.E6.8E.89.E7.BA.BF.E4.BA.86.EF.BC.8C.E6.98.AF.E5.90.A6.E8.BF.98.E4.BC.9A.E7.BB.A7.E7.BB.AD.E8.AE.A1.E8.B4.B9.EF.BC.9F)
</dx-fold-block>







#### Sample code  

Sample code for processing the callback, including room entry and network disconnection events.

```
-(void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary *)data{
    NSLog(@"OnEvent:%lu,data:%@",(unsigned long)eventType,data);
    switch (eventType) {
        case ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_ROOM:
        {
            int result = ((NSNumber*)[data objectForKey:@"result"]).intValue;
            NSString* error_info = [data objectForKey:@"error_info"];
           	 //Receive the event of successful room entry
        }
            break;
	}
}

```

#### Data details

| Message | Data | Sample |
| ------------------------------------ | :----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ENTER_ROOM      | result; error_info | {"error_info":"","result":0}                                 |
| ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ROOM_DISCONNECT | result; error_info | {"error_info":"waiting timeout, please check your network","result":0} |


If the network is disconnected, there will be a disconnected callback prompt `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE.ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_ROOM_DISCONNECT`. At this time, the SDK will automatically reconnect, and the callback is `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_RECONNECT_START`. When the reconnection is successful, there will be a callback `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_RECONNECT_SUCCESS`.


#### Error codes

| Error Code Value | Cause and Suggested Solution |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 7006 | Authentication failed <li>The `AppID` does not exist or is incorrect.<li>An error occurred while authenticating the `authbuff`.<li>Authentication expired.<li>The `OpenId` does not meet the specification. |
| 7007 | Already in another room. |
| 1001 | The user was already in the process of entering a room but repeated this operation. It is recommended not to call the room entering API until the room entry callback is returned. |
| 1003 | The user was already in the room and called the room entering API again. |
| 1101 | Make sure that the SDK is initialized, `OpenId` complies with the rules, the APIs are called in the same thread, and the `Poll` API is called normally. |

### [Exiting the room](id:ExitRoom)

This API is called to exit the current room. It is an async API. The returned value of `AV_OK` indicates a successful async delivery.



<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
If there is a scenario in the application where room entry is performed immediately after room exit, you don't need to wait for the `RoomExitComplete` callback notification from the `ExitRoom` API during API call; instead, you can directly call the API.
</dx-alert>



#### Function prototype  

```
-(int)ExitRoom

```

#### Sample code  

```
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] ExitRoom];

```

### Callback for room exit

After the user exits a room, a callback will be returned with the message being `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_EXIT_ROOM`.

#### Sample code  

```
-(void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary *)data{
    NSLog(@"OnEvent:%lu,data:%@",(unsigned long)eventType,data);
    switch (eventType) {
        case ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_EXIT_ROOM:
        {
            // Receive the event of successful room exit
        }
            break;
    }
}

```

#### Data details

| Message | Data | Sample |
| ------------------------------ | :----------------: | ---------------------------- |
| ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_EXIT_ROOM | result; error_info | {"error_info":"","result":0} |

### Determining whether user has entered room

This API is used to determine whether the user has entered a room. A bool-type value will be returned. The call is invalid during the process of room entry.

#### Function prototype  

```
-(BOOL)IsRoomEntered;

```

#### Sample code  

```
[[ITMGContext GetInstance] IsRoomEntered];

```


### Switching room

User can call this API to quickly switch the voice chat room after entering the room. After the room is switched, the device is not reset, that is, if the microphone is already enabled in this room, the microphone will keep enabled after the room is switched.

The callback for quickly switching rooms is `ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE.ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_SWITCH_ROOM`, and the fields are `error_info` and `result`.

#### API prototype

```
-(int) SwitchRoom:(NSString *)roomID  authBuffer:(NSData*)authBuffer;

```

#### Type descriptions

| Parameter         | Type       | Description                           |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| targetRoomID | NSString * | ID of the room to enter |
| authBuffer | NSData* | Generates a new authentication with the ID of the room to enter |

#### Callback sample code

```
- (IBAction)swichRoom:(id)sender {
    NSData* authBuffer = [QAVAuthBuffer GenAuthBuffer:_appId.intValue roomID:_roomIdText.text openID:_openId key:_key];
    [[[ITMGContext GetInstance]GetRoom]SwitchRoom:_roomIdText.text authBuffer:authBuffer];
}

-(void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary *)data{
    NSString* log =[NSString stringWithFormat:@"OnEvent:%d,data:%@", (int)eventType, data];
    [self showLog:log];
    NSLog(@"====%@====",log);
    switch (eventType) {
	case ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE_SWITCH_ROOM:
        {
            int result = ((NSNumber*)[data objectForKey:@"result"]).intValue;
            NSString* log = nil;
            if (result == QAV_OK) {
                log = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"switch room success."];
            } else {
                log = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"switch room failed."];
            }
            [self showLog:log];
            break;
        }
    }
}

```


### Cross-room mic connection

Call this API to connect the microphones across rooms after entering the room. And the local user can communicate with the target OpenID user in the target room.

#### Example
User a is in room A, user b is in room B, and user a can talk with b through the cross-room API. When user c in room A speaks, users b and d in room B cannot hear. User c in room A can hear only the voice in room A and the voice of user b in room B but not other users in room B.

#### API prototype

```
-(int) StartRoomSharing:(NSString *)targetRoomID targetOpenID:(NSString *)targetOpenID authBuffer:(NSData*)authBuffer;

-(int) StopRoomSharing;

```

#### Type descriptions

| Parameter         | Type       | Description                    |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| targetRoomID | NSString * | ID of the room to connect mic |
| targetOpenID | NSString * | The target OpenID to connect mic |
| authBuffer | NSData* | Reserved flag. You just need to enter NULL. |

#### Sample code

```
- (IBAction)shareRoom:(id)sender {
    if(_shareRoomSwitch.isOn){
        [[[ITMGContext GetInstance]GetRoom]StartRoomSharing:_shareRoomID.text targetOpenID:_shareOpenID.text authBuffer:NULL];
    }else{
        [[[ITMGContext GetInstance]GetRoom]StopRoomSharing];
    }
}
}

```

### Notifications of member room entry and speaking status

This API is used to obtain the user speaking in the room and display it in the UI, and to send a notification when someone entering or exiting the room.

Notification for this event will be sent only when the status changes. To get member status in real time, cache the notification when it is received at a higher layer. The event message is `ITMG_MAIN_EVNET_TYPE_USER_UPDATE`, where the data contains `event_id` and `user_list`. The event message will be identified in the `OnEvent` function.
Notifications for audio events are subject to a threshold, and a notification will be sent only when this threshold is exceeded. The notification "A member has stopped sending audio packets” will be sent if no audio packets are received in more than two seconds. This event only returns the member speaking event, but not the specific volume level. If you need the specific volume levels of members in the room, use the `GetVolumeById` API.


| event_id | Description | Maintenance |
| ---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------: | ---------------------- |
| ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_ENTER | A member enters the room | Member list |
| ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_EXIT | A member exits the room | Member list |
| ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_HAS_AUDIO | A member sends audio packets. This event can be used to determine whether a user is speaking and display the voiceprint effect. It can be called together with getRecvStreamLevel. | Chat member list |
| ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_NO_AUDIO | A member stops sending audio packets | Chat member list |

#### Room member maintenance flowchart

![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/33eecfcd9e18a361aa0b732ffd0fb7dd.png)

#### Sample code

```
-(void)OnEvent:(ITMG_MAIN_EVENT_TYPE)eventType data:(NSDictionary *)data{
    ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_UPDATE event_id=((NSNumber*)[data objectForKey:@"event_id"]).intValue;
    NSMutableArray* uses = [NSMutableArray arrayWithArray: [data objectForKey:@"user_list"]];
    NSLog(@"OnEvent:%lu,data:%@",(unsigned long)eventType,data);
    switch (eventType) {
        case ITMG_MAIN_EVNET_TYPE_USER_UPDATE:
		{
		// Process
		//Parse the parameter to get `event_id` and `user_list`
		    switch (eventID)
 		    {
 		    case ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_ENTER:
  			    // A member enters the room
  			    break;
 		    case ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_EXIT:
  			    // A member exits the room
			    break;
		    case ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_HAS_AUDIO:
			    // A member sends audio packets
			    break;
		    case ITMG_EVENT_ID_USER_NO_AUDIO:
			    // A member stops sending audio packets
			    break;
 		    }
		break;
		}
    }
}

```

#### Data details

| Message | Data | Sample |
| -------------------------------- | :-----------------: | ----------------------------- |
| ITMG_MAIN_EVNET_TYPE_USER_UPDATE | event_id; user_list | {"event_id":0,"user_list":""} |


### Muting in a room


This API is used to add an ID to the audio data blacklist. This operation blocks audio from someone and only applies to the local device. A returned value of `0` indicates the call is successful. Assume that users A, B, and C are all speaking using their mic in a room: 

- If A blocks C, A can only hear B;
- If B blocks neither A nor C, B can hear both of them;
- If C blocks neither A nor B, C can hear both of them.

This API is suitable for scenarios where a user is muted in a room.

#### Function prototype  

```
ITMGContext GetAudioCtrl -(QAVResult)AddAudioBlackList:(NSString*)openID;

```

| Parameter   |   Type   | Description              |
| ------ | :------: | ----------------- |
| openId | NSString | ID to be blocked openid  |

#### Sample code  

```
[[[ITMGContext GetInstance]GetAudioCtrl ] AddAudioBlackList[id]];

```

### Unmuting

This API is used to remove an ID from the audio data blocklist. A returned value of `0` indicates the call is successful.

#### Function prototype  

```
-(QAVResult)RemoveAudioBlackList:(NSString*)openID;

```

| Parameter   |   Type   | Description              |
| ------ | :------: | ----------------- |
| openId | NSString | ID to be unblocked openid  |

#### Sample code  

```
[[[ITMGContext GetInstance]GetAudioCtrl ] RemoveAudioBlackList[openId]];

```


## Voice Chat Audio APIs

![Image](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/c85fe68b4b26555adf8ad01c82711f5b.png)

### Notes on voice chat audio connection

The voice chat APIs can only be called after SDK initialization and room entry.
When Enable/Disable Mic/Speaker is clicked on the UI, the following practices are recommended:
- **For most game applications, it is recommended to call the `EnableMic` and `EnableSpeaker` APIs**, which is equivalent to calling the `EnableAudioCaptureDevice/EnableAudioSend` and `EnableAudioPlayDevice/EnableAudioRecv` APIs.
- For other mobile applications (such as social networking applications), enabling/disabling a capturing device will restart both capturing and playback devices. If the application is playing back background music, it will also be interrupted. Playback will not be interrupted if the mic is enabled/disabled through control of upstreaming/downstreaming. **Calling method: call `EnableAudioCaptureDevice(true)` and `EnableAudioPlayDevice(true)` once after room entry, and call `EnableAudioSend/Recv` to send/receive audio streams when Enable/Disable Mic is clicked**.
- For more information on how to release only a capturing or playback device, please see the `EnableAudioCaptureDevice` and `EnableAudioPlayDevice`.
- Call the `pause` API to pause the audio engine and call the `resume` API to resume the audio engine.

### Voice chat audio APIs

| API | Description |
| --------------------------- | :----------------------------: |
| EnableMic | Enables/disables mic |
| GetMicState | Gets mic status |
| EnableAudioCaptureDevice | Enables/disables capturing device |
| IsAudioCaptureDeviceEnabled | Gets capturing device status |
| EnableAudioSend | Enables/disables audio upstreaming |
| IsAudioSendEnabled | Gets audio upstreaming status |
| GetMicLevel | Gets real-time mic volume |
| GetSendStreamLevel | Gets real-time audio upstreaming volume |
| SetMicVolume | Sets mic volume |
| GetMicVolume | Gets mic volume |
| EnableSpeaker | Enables/disables speaker |
| GetSpeakerState | Gets speaker status |
| EnableAudioPlayDevice | Enables/disables playback device |
| IsAudioPlayDeviceEnabled | Gets playback device status |
| EnableAudioRecv | Enables/disables audio downstreaming |
| IsAudioRecvEnabled | Gets audio downstreaming status |
| GetSpeakerLevel | Gets real-time speaker volume |
| GetRecvStreamLevel | Gets real-time downstreaming audio levels of other members in room |
| SetSpeakerVolume | Sets speaker volume |
| GetSpeakerVolume | Gets speaker volume |
| EnableLoopBack | Enables/disables in-ear monitoring |

## Voice Chat Capturing APIs

### [Enabling or disabling the microphone](id:EnableMic)

This API is used to enable/disable the mic. Mic and speaker are not enabled by default after room entry.
**If accompaniment is used, please call this API as instructed in [Accompaniment in Voice Chat](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/31504).**

**EnableMic = EnableAudioCaptureDevice + EnableAudioSend**


#### Function prototype  

```
-(QAVResult)EnableMic:(BOOL)enable;

```

| Parameter      |  Type   | Description                                                         |
