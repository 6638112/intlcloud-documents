GME has six major strengths:

## Strength 1. Wide game scenario coverage

To comprehensively meet diversified voice needs in gaming scenarios, GME provides a rich set of services such as voice chat, voice messaging, and speech-to-text conversion to implement mainstream voice-enabled features such as team battling and commanding. Its proprietary 3D voice technology is ideal for creating an immersive gaming experience in scenarios such as survival and VR games. Moreover, it makes gaming even more enjoyable with its amusing voice changing and vocal beautification features.

## Strength 2. Ultimate gaming sound effect experience

GME optimizes voice chat in depth based on use cases. Its patented algorithms for echo cancellation as well as noise suppression help restore the crystal clear sound effect of audio. Further, its deep integration with the Wwise audio engine ingeniously solves the problem where the background sound effects are lost when in-game voice is enabled.
