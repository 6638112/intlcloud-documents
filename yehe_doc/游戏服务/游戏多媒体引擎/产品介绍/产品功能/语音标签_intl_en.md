**GME's voice tag service** analyzes the input audio data based on AI models to add tags such as age, gender, and tone to the audio.
 

## Overview
- **Age tag**: GME recognizes the age range of players.
- **Gender tag**: GME recognizes the gender of players.
- **Tone tag**: GME recognizes the tone of players.


## Use cases
**1. Gaming feature rating**
- GME allows you to rate gaming features by age; for example, you can provide the minor mode and adult mode in your game.
- GME enables rated management of ad content and game stories.

**2. Minor protection**
 - GME uses voice recognition to detect minor players in team battling, so as to find minors bypassing identity verification and the anti-addiction system.
 - For accounts publishing non-compliant content involving minors, such as sensitive content, privacy, sexually suggestive content, and violent content, GME quickly locates and blocks them to prevent the risky information involving minors from being spread.

**3. User characteristic analysis**
GME summarizes users' characteristics according to their age, gender, and tone and analyzes such characteristics to facilitate game operations.


## Product strengths
**1. High accuracy and recall rate**
GME delivers industry-leading accuracy and recall rates. In game voice scenarios, the accuracy and recall rate reach at least 95%.

Plus, the AI model is optimized in depth for various voice chat-based gaming scenarios, such as Werewolf, team battling, and game audio interaction, so as to effectively recognize their tags.
**2. High performance**
GME supports a high number of concurrent recognition requests and requests for large files. It can be scaled horizontally and deployed in multiple regions to guarantee that recognition tasks are not blocked.
**3. Support for various languages**
GME's voice tag recognition model supports various languages worldwide.
**4. Security compliance and privacy protection**
GME does not require user identity information to assist with recognition or retain moderated audio to protect the user privacy.
