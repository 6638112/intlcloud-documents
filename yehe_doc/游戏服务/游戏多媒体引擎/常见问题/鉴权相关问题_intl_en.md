### How do I ensure the security of authentication?
We recommend deploying the authentication feature on the client at the early stage, and later deploying it at the game app backend.

| Solution | Advantage | Disadvantage |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Deployment on backend | Higher security| Joint testing by backend developers is required |
| Deployment on client | Quick integration | Lower security |


### How long is the validity of the authentication generated by the client?
The validity is permanent.

### When I access GME, an error code is displayed prompting an authentication failure. How to fix it?
First, check if the voice message service is enabled in the console. If yes, then verify the following:
- The SDK `AppID` is consistent with it in the console.
- The `OpenID` is greater than 10,000.
- `null` must be entered for the parameter of the voice message room ID.
- The key obtained from the Tencent Cloud console is valid.



### Is any LIB file available for TEA encryption?

We provide the [Authbuffer](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/607/31461) compilation document and a ZIP file.
