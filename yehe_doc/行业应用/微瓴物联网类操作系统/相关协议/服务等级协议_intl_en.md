The service availability of Tencent Cloud Weiling is determined on a service cycle basis. It is calculated from the average 5-minute error rate, which is calculated by dividing the sum of 5-minute error rates in a service cycle by the total number of 5-minute periods in the service cycle, i.e., service availability = (1 - sum of 5-minute error rates in a service cycle/total number of 5-minute periods in the service cycle) * 100%.
