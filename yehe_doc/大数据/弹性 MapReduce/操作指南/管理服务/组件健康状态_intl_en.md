The component health status shows whether the current component is running normally. It is aggregated from the health statuses of all roles and can be viewed on the **Cluster Service** page.

## Component Health Status
There are four component health statuses: Good, Risky, Unavailable, and Unknown or Not Checked. Different statuses are displayed in different colors. 

| Component Health Status | Description | Status Aggregation Rule |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Green: Good   | The service is running normally. | The health statuses of all role instances are Good. |
| Orange: Risky | Service available. The health status of some role instances is Unavailable or Risky. Please handle. | The health statuses of some instances of a role under the component are Unavailable or Risky. For example, if HDFS has one NameNode role instance and two DataNode role instances, the health status of one DataNode role instance is Unavailable, and the health statuses of the other DataNode role instance and the NameNode role instance are Good, then the health status of HDFS is Risky. |
| Red: Unavailable | Service unavailable. The health status of all instances of a role is Unavailable. Please handle in time. | The health statuses of all instances of a role under the component are UNAVAILABLE. For example, if HDFS has one NameNode role instance and two DataNode role instances, the health statuses of the two DataNode role instances are Unavailable, and the health status of the NameNode role instance is Good, the health status of HDFS is Unavailable. |	
| Gray: Unknown or Not Checked | Service health status Unknown or Not Checked. If there is no component, the health status will be Not Checked because no check is conducted; if there is a component, but it is in the maintenance mode or its operation status is Stopped, the health status will be Not Checked; if there is a component, but the health status of role instances cannot be obtained correctly, the health status will be Unknown. Ignore this if no problem is found in troubleshooting. | 1. The health statuses of all role instances of the component are not Risky or Unavailable, and the health status of at least one role instance is Unknown or Not Checked. For example, if HDFS has one NameNode role instance and two DataNode role instances, the health status of one DataNode role instance is Unknown or Not Checked, and the health statuses of the other DataNode role instance and the NameNode role instance are Good, the health status of HDFS is Unknown or Not Checked; <br>2. The component has no processes, so no check is conducted, such as Iceberg, Hudi, and Flink. |
