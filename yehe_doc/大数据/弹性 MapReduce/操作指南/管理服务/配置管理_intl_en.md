## Feature Overview
Configuration management allows you to modify key configuration parameters of popular open-source components like HDFS, YARN, Hive, and Spark. The configuration of services can be modified as needed at the level of cluster, node, or configuration group. This document describes how to configure service parameters in the console.
>! 
>- For security reasons, when a custom configuration file is deleted in **Configuration Management** in the console, it will not be deleted from the client.
>- If you need to delete a custom configuration file from the client, you can use a cluster script to batch perform the operation on existing clusters.


## Directions
### Modifying a configuration item
1. Log in to the [EMR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr), select the target cluster in the **Cluster list**, and click **Service** to enter the cluster service list.
2. In the cluster service list, select **Operation** > **Configuration Management** in the top-right corner of the target service panel.

3. On the **Configuration Management** page, select the **Level** as needed. By default, **Cluster level** is selected.
	- To configure the parameters of all nodes of the selected service in the cluster, select **Cluster level**.
	- To configure the parameters of multiple specified nodes of the selected service, create a configuration group and use it as the level.
	- To configure the parameters of a specified node of the selected service, select **Node level**.

4. You can search for configuration items by name or filter them by type.
>? Currently, only HDFS, YARN, Hive, HBase, and Spark support filtering by configuration type.
5. Click **Modify configuration** and enter the new parameter value for the target parameter. If needed, you can click **Recover** to recover a parameter to its original value. You can also click **Default Value** to restore the parameter to the default value recommended by the system. **Delete** next to a parameter indicates that the parameter can be deleted. To delete it, click **Delete** > **Confirm**.
6. After confirming that the modification is correct, click **Save configuration**. After the configuration is delivered successfully, click **Restart Service**.

### Adding a configuration item
