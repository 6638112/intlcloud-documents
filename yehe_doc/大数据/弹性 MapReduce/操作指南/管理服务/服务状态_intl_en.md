## Feature Overview
Service status provides detailed monitoring for main services installed in the cluster, including HDFS, Yarn, Hive, ZooKeeper, Spark, HBase, and Presto. This document describes how to view cluster service status in the console.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EMR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and click a cluster ID/name on the **Cluster List** page to go to the cluster details page.
2. On the cluster details page, select **Cluster Service** and click **Operation** > **Service Status** in the top right corner of the target component. The following uses HDFS as an example:

3. The service status page provides monitoring views of three service dimensions, namely, service overview, service summary, and role list. As different service components have different services, the dimensions of display vary.
4. **Service Overview** displays six metrics of service components by default and their statistical rules during a specified time period. You can click **Set Metric** to customize the displayed metrics.

## HBase Table Load
### Feature description
**HBase Table Load** enables you to monitor the number of read/write requests and storage of each table in HBase.

### Viewing HBase table load
1. Log in to the [EMR console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr) and click a cluster ID/name on the **Cluster List** page to go to the cluster details page.
2. On the cluster details page, select **Cluster Service** and click **Operation** -> **Service Status** -> **HBase Table Load** of the HBase component.
3. **HBase Table Load** displays real-time information of HBase tables in four dimensions: number of read requests, number of write requests, size of MemStore, and size of storeFile. You can click the table header to sort tables by corresponding dimension. In addition, you can enter a table name in the search box in the top left corner and click ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1f9d505f9e8e4688a73646781370b535.png) to search.
