## Feature Overview
This document describes how to add components in the EMR Console.
>
- Please manage the components through **Cluster Service**. Component changes made directly to a server (such as adding a component) will not be synced to the console and thus cannot be further managed.
- Components on a different EMR version or component version cannot be added. Instead, you can only add components on the current EMR version.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EMR Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr), select the target cluster in **Cluster List**, and click **Details** to enter the cluster details page.
2. On the cluster details page, select **Cluster Service** > **Add Component** to add a component not installed in the cluster.

3. If there is no metadatabase in the cluster and Hive, Sqoop, Hue, Ranger, Oozie, and Presto are to be installed, you need to purchase a TencentDB instance as the metadata store. There are two storage methods for Hive metadata: you can store the metadata in the default MetaDB instance of the cluster or associate the metadata with EMR-MetaDB or a self-built MySQL database. In the latter case, metadata will be stored in an associated database and will not be terminated when the cluster is terminated.

4. The selection for MetaDB purchase and Hive metadatabase is the same as when you purchase a new cluster.
5. After selecting the component, click **OK**.
