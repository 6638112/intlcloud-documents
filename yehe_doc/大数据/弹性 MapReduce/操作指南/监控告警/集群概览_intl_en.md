## Feature Overview
Cluster overview displays a summary of cluster operation status, where you can view the cluster operation status, core service metrics, core node metrics, and top 10 nodes.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [EMR Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/emr), select **Cluster List**, and click the ID/Name of the target cluster to enter the cluster details page.
2. Select **Cluster Monitoring** > **Cluster Overview** on the cluster details page to view the overall conditions of the cluster. The **Cluster Overview** page provides four monitoring views at the cluster level, namely, overall conditions, key cluster metrics, cluster deployment status, and top 10 nodes.
- In **Overall Conditions**, you can view the cluster status, number of components and nodes, and metadatabase.
