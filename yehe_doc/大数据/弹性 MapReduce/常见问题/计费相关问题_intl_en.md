### When I purchase a pay-as-you-go cluster, why am I prompted that my account balance is insufficient yet my balance is actually sufficient?
As some pay-as-you-go clusters are costly, and fees will be frozen, you may be prompted that your account balance is insufficient at the time of purchase.


### Can I change a non-HA EMR cluster to an HA one through configuration upgrade or scale-out?
No. You need to purchase a new one.

### Will EMR servers be displayed in CVM bills after fees are deducted by EMR?
EMR servers in the format of `emr-vm-xxxxxxx` will be displayed in both EMR and CVM bills, but fees will be displayed as 0 in CVM bills.
