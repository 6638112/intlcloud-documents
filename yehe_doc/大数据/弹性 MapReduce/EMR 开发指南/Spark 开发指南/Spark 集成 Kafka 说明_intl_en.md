### Dependencies
Starting from v2.3, Spark no longer supports Kafka 0.8.2. As Spark 2.4.3 and later are integrated into EMR in the production environment, you need to integrate Kafka 0.10.0 and later.


### How to view
1. Enter the version number in the following URL and open it:
```
https://spark.apache.org/docs/{spark.version}/streaming-kafka-integration.html
```
Replace `{spark.version}` with the actual Spark version. For example, to view the dependencies of v3.2.2, the URL should be as follows:
```
https://spark.apache.org/docs/3.2.2/streaming-kafka-integration.html
```
2. Click the appropriate link to view detailed integration instructions.
