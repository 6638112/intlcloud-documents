EMR supports Spark 3.x and 2.x. The software environment information is as follows:
- By default, Spark is installed on a master node.
- After logging in, run the `su hadoop` command to switch to the `hadoop` user.
- The Spark software path is `/usr/local/service/spark`.
- The relevant logs are stored in `/data/emr`.

The above is mainly about how to access COS by using Spark. For more information, see the [community documentation](http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.2/).
