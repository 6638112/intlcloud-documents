## Webpage Behavior Analysis
Kafka clusters process website activities (PV, search, etc.) in real time and publish them to topics by type. These information flows can be used for real-time monitoring or offline statistical analysis.

A large amount of activity information is generated in each user's PV, therefore, website activity tracking requires high throughput. Kafka clusters perfectly meet the requirements of high throughput and offline processing.

## Log Aggregation
Kafka clusters feature low-latency processing, supporting multiple data sources and distributed data processing (consumption). Compared with centralized log aggregation systems, Kafka provides better persistence and lower end-to-end latency while delivering the same performance.

The above features make Kafka clusters an ideal log collection center. Multiple servers/applications can asynchronously send operation logs in batches to Kafka clusters instead of saving them locally or in a DB. Kafka clusters can submit/compress messages in batches, and producers can hardly perceive the performance overhead. Consumers can use systematic storage and analysis systems such as Hadoop to analyze the pulled logs.

## Online/Offline Analysis
In some big data scenarios, a large amount of concurrent data needs to be processed and aggregated. This requires clusters to have excellent processing performance and high scalability. Moreover, Kafka clustersâ€™ data distribution mechanism, in terms of disk space allocation, message format processing, server selection, and data compression, also makes them suitable for handling high numbers of real-time messages and aggregating distributed application data, which facilitates system OPS.

Kafka clusters can better aggregate, process, and analyze offline and streaming data.
