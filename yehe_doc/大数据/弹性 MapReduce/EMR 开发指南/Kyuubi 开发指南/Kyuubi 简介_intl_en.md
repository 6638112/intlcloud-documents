## Use Cases
- You can replace HiveServer2 to increase the performance by 10â€“100 times.
	- Kyuubi is highly compatible with HiveServer2 APIs and supports seamless migration.
	- The layered architecture of Kyuubi eliminates client compatibility issues and supports imperceptible upgrade.
	- Kyuubi supports full-linkage Spark SQL optimization and enhancement for an excellent performance.
	- Kyuubi offers various enterprise-grade features, such as high availability, multi-tenancy, and fine-grained authentication.
- You can build a Serverless Spark platform.
	- The goal of serverless Spark is definitely not to let you call Spark APIs or continue to write Spark jobs.
	- The built-in engine module of Kyuubi makes Spark easier to use, and you don't even need to understand the logic.
	- You can focus on your business development by manipulating data through JDBC and SQL. The resources are elastically scalable and Ops-free.
	- Resource managers such as Kubernetes and YARN as well as engine lifecycle are supported. Spark allocates resources dynamically and elastically at three different granularities.
	- You can schedule resources with multiple resource managers such as YARN and Kubernetes simultaneously. This guarantees the secure migration of historical jobs to the cloud.
	- Spark Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) and Kyuubi AQE Plus robustly empower data operations.
- You can build a unified data lake insight, analysis, and management platform (with Kyuubi 1.5 or later).
	- All Spark and third-party data sources are supported.
	- Metadata can be managed through Spark DSv2 to visually build and manage data lakes.
	- All popular data lake frameworks are supported, including Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi, and Delta Lake.
	- With one copy of data for one API and one engine, Kyuubi provides a unified query, analysis, data ingestion, and data lake management platform.
	- Kyuubi integrates batch processing and stream processing and supports stream operations (upcoming).
