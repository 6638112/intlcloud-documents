Before using EMR, carefully read and understand the following use limits:
- To ensure the cluster network security, new clusters will be placed in the same VPC. Do not change the VPC of an existing cluster or node; otherwise, the cluster network may fail.
- When you create a cluster, EMR can help you create a new security group, or you can also manually select an existing EMR security group. Make sure that the selected security group has the necessary inbound/outbound rules for EMR. Do not delete or change the security group in use after creating the cluster; otherwise, cluster communication may fail, thus affecting the service.
- Plan the storage space of nodes in advance based on your business needs, and promptly add storage nodes, as an insufficient storage space may cause data and node risks. Currently, core, task, and router nodes in the EMR cluster support mounting multiple cloud disks, and a node can have up to 15 cloud disks. Clusters in BM 2.0 and local disk models (IO and D series) don't support mounting multiple cloud disks.
- When using EMR, do not perform operations in the CVM console, such as shutdown, restart, VPC switch, security group rule adjustment, so as to avoid cluster exceptions. OS reinstallation, instance termination, configuration adjustment, renewal, and billing mode change are also not recommended. You can perform necessary cluster maintenance operations in the EMR console.
- Public IPs can increase the possibility of master nodes being attacked, so you need to manage and monitor the risks. EIPs (including the IPs on the secondary ENI) will be retained after the cluster is terminated, and the idle IPs will continue to incur fees. If you don't need to retain them, release them on the corresponding resource management page.
- When you create a cluster, EMR provides component initialization parameters for general scenarios. Before you use components such as HDFS and HBase, we recommend you check whether the component parameters meet the needs of your business scenarios. To get the component initialization guide, contact us.
- Keep the host login password of your EMR cluster secure. If you configure passwordless login for cross-node access, Tencent Cloud security services may detect vulnerability risks and prompt you.
- Even if an exception occurs in your cluster, the cluster will continue to be billed. In this case, we recommend you promptly contact us for assistance. If we need to log in to your cluster for troubleshooting, we will gain your consent to request your account and password.

When you use or maintain your EMR cluster, some unexpected operations may render it unavailable or unstable, and you will receive a risk warning before performing such operations in the console. This document lists some of the prohibited and risky operations:
