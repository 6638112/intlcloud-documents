EMR supports six cluster types and their respective use cases and defines five node types. Different cluster types and their respective use cases support different node types, number of deployed nodes, and deployed services. You can select the most appropriate cluster type and use case based on your business needs when creating a cluster.
>? ClickHouse, Doris, and Kafka cluster types are not available by default. To use them, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.

<td >Default use case</td>
<td >Based on open-source Hadoop and the components that form a Hadoop ecosystem, it provides big data solutions for massive data storage, offline/real-time data analysis, streaming data compute, and machine learning.</td>
<td><ul style="margin:0"><li/><b>Master node: </b>It is a management node that ensures the scheduling of the cluster works properly. Processes such as NameNode, ResourceManager, and HMaster are deployed here. The number of master nodes is 1 in non-HA mode or 2 in HA mode.
<br><b>Note: If Kudu is included in the deployed components, the cluster supports only the HA mode, and the number of master nodes is 3.</b>
<li/><b>Core node: </b>It is a compute and storage node. All your data in HDFS is stored in core nodes. Therefore, in order to ensure data security, once core nodes are scaled out, they cannot be scaled in. Processes such as DataNode, NodeManager, and RegionServer are deployed here. The number of core nodes is ≥2 in non-HA mode or ≥3 in HA mode.
<li/><b>Task node: </b>It is a pure compute node and does not store any data. The computed data comes from a core node or COS. Therefore, it is often used as an elastic node and can be scaled in or out at any time. Processes such as NodeManager and PrestoWork are deployed here. The number of task nodes can be changed at any time to scale the cluster. The minimum value is 0. 
<li/><b>Common node: </b>It provides data sharing and syncing and HA fault tolerance services for the master nodes in an HA cluster. Distributed coordinator components such as ZooKeeper and JournalNode are deployed here. The number of common nodes is 0 in non-HA mode or ≥3 in HA mode.
<li/><b>Router node: </b>It is used to share the load of a master node or as the task submitter of the cluster. It can be scaled in or out at any time. Hadoop packages, including software programs and processes such as Hive, Hue, and Spark, are deployed here. The number of router nodes can be changed at any time. The minimum value is 0.</ul></td>
