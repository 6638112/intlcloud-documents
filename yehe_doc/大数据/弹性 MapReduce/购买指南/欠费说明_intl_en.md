## Pay-As-You-Go

### Overdue payment reminder

| Reminder Type | Description |

### Overdue payment policy
When your account balance becomes negative, the pay-as-you-go cluster can be used and fees will be deducted for 2 more hours. After 2 hours, the cluster will be moved to the recycle bin and become unavailable, and we will also stop billing you for service.
