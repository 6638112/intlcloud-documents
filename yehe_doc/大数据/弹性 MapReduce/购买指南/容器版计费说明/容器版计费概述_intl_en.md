## Billing Overview
Container-based EMR clusters are deployed in EKS and free you from managing cluster nodes. However, to reasonably allocate resources and accurately calculate fees, you need to specify resource specifications for Pods when configuring a job. Tencent Cloud allocates computing resources to the workload and calculates the fees based on the specifications.
Currently, container-based EMR is pay-as-you-go by the amount of EKS CPU and memory resources required to run services.

>1. The following prices are only for the configurations of CPU and memory, which donâ€™t include cloud data disk and bandwidth fees.
>2. For cloud disk prices, see [Billing Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/362/32415).

Container-based EMR provides Intel resources by default. If you need AMD resources, configure the job accordingly.
The service calculates applicable fees based on the container resource type you select.

Billing formula: Fees = billable item configuration * resource unit price * execution time
