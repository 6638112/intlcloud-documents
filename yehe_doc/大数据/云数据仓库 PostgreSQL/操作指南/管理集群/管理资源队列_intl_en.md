## Overview
When you use CDWPG, a single complex query may consume too many resources and affect other queries or computing. You can utilize a resource queue to limit system resource usage by a single user or query statement.

## Directions
1. Click **Manage** in the cluster list to enter the cluster details page.
2. Select **Configuration** > **Resource Queue**, click **Create Resource Queue**, and configure parameter values.
3. Click **OK**. After the resource queue is created, you can specify it to limit resources during querying.
