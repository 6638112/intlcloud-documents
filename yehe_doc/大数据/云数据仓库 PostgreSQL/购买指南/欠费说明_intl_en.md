- ## Pay-as-You-Go

  ### Overdue payment alert

  Pay-as-you-go resources are billed on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators will be notified by email and SMS.

  ### Overdue payment policy

- From the moment your account balance becomes negative, the CDWPG service will remain available for 24 hours. We will also continue to bill you for this period.

- After 24 hours, your CDWPG cluster will be isolated (the cluster will become inaccessible and your data will be retained for seven days), and billing will stop.

  ### Repossession mechanism

- If you top up your account within 24 hours to a positive balance, the billing will continue, and the CDWPG cluster will be automatically recovered.

- If your account balance remains negative for seven days after resource isolation, your CDWPG cluster will be repossessed, and **all data will be cleared and cannot be recovered**.

- We will notify your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators by email and SMS when your CDWPG cluster is repossessed.
