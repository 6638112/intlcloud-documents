Cloud Data Warehouse for PostgreSQL (CDWPG, formerly Snova Data Warehouse) offers a simple, fast, and cost-effective petabyte-level data warehouse solution in the cloud. It is compatible with the open-source data warehouse Greenplum and based on the massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture. It allows you to leverage diversified open-source PostgreSQL tools for ad-hoc query and analysis, ETL processing, and visual exploration of massive amounts of data in the cloud. With seamless cloud data integration, you can also easily analyze petabytes of data on data engines such as COS, TencentDB, and Elasticsearch Service. 

## Benefits
### Elastic scaling 
CDWPG delivers convenient and elastic scalability, allowing you to scale hundreds of nodes and adjust their configurations through simple operations through the console or TencentCloud API. You can choose to scale the compute unit, CPU, memory, and storage proportionally to better match your business needs and progress.  

### Ease of use 
Cluster management, monitoring, and maintenance can be done in the console, freeing you from the cumbersome Ops of the underlying infrastructure. CDWPG fully conforms to the ANSI 2008 standard for SQL, so you can build an enterprise-grade data warehouse with standard SQL. You can also directly query COS data without preloading needed. 

### Seamless integration 
CDWPG supports unlimited expansion of the storage capacity on top of COS. It can work with a wide variety of tools and solutions to enable high-speed data import from multiple sources (such as traditional relational databases, CKafka, and Oceanus) for aggregation and analysis in the cloud.  

### Best-in-class performance 
CDWPG boasts a distributed MPP framework to linearly scale the storage and computing capabilities. With hybrid row/column-oriented storage, it offers an optimal storage solution for your business to query data several times faster than traditional data warehouses thanks to its deeply optimized query engine.  

### High security and reliability 
CDWPG has two nodes in a redundant way to implement failover and disaster recovery imperceptible to users. It adopts distributed deployment to protect compute units, servers, and cabinets to secure critical data infrastructure. Furthermore, your clusters are independently deployed in isolated VPCs for more secure data access.
