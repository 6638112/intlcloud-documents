CDWPG supports the following node specifications:

- Storage-elastic: The underlying storage device is enhanced cloud disk with elastic scalability.

We recommend you select node specifications based on the storage and computing power required by your business. Meanwhile, CDWPG supports COS-based external table extensions and achieves data compression on external storage via gzip. In this case, data that is not involved in real-time computing can be stored externally to further reduce the storage costs.
