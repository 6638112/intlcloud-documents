### 1.2 Service Month(s)

Service Month(s) refers to the calendar month(s) within the term of the Service purchased by you.

The Service Availability will be calculated separately for each Service Month.

### 1.3 Service Unavailability

In a certain minute, if all your continuous requests to establish a connection to a specified Cloud Data Warehouse Cluster (“***\*Cluster\****”) fail attributable to Tencent Cloud, the Service is deemed as unavailable (“***\*Service Unavailability\****”) in such minute, except under the circumstances as set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement.

### 1.4 Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within Service Month(s)

The sum of unavailable unit time in a Service Month is Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within such Service Month.

### 1.5 Total Number of Minutes within Service Month(s)

Total Number of Minutes within Service Month(s) = the total number of days in such Service Month(s) × 24 (hours) × 60 (minutes).

### 1.6 Monthly Service Fee

Each Cluster calculates the Monthly Service Fee separately based on the actual consumption in a Service Month. If you purchase a Cluster on October 20, even if you pay for services in multiple months in a lump sum, the Monthly Service Fee for October only refers to the fee incurred for using such Cluster from October 20 to October 31.

## 2. Service Availability

### 2.1 Calculation of Service Availability

Service Availability is calculated **on a single Cluster basis** as follows:

**Service Availability = (Total Number of Minutes within a Service Month - Service Downtime Calculated in Minutes within such Service Month) / Total Number of Minutes within such Service Month × 100%.**

### 2.2 Service Availability Standard

The Service Availability for the Service **shall be no less than 99.9%** (“**Service Availability Standard**”), which means that the Service Availability for a single Cluster **shall be no less than 99.9% in each Service Month**.

## 3. Compensation Plan

In respect of the Service, if the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you will be entitled to compensations in accordance with the following terms:

### 3.1 Standards of Compensation

(1) Compensations will be made **in the form of voucher** by Tencent Cloud, and after receiving the voucher, you should use the voucher by abiding the voucher usage rules (including usage period, etc., subject to the voucher usage rules published on Tencent Cloud official website). Such voucher cannot be converted into cash, and no invoice will be issued with respect thereof. The voucher may only be used to purchase the Service by using your Tencent Cloud account, and you cannot use the voucher to purchase other services of Tencent Cloud, nor should you give the voucher to a third party for consideration or for free.

(2) If the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard in any Service Month, the amount of compensation shall be calculated for such Service Month independently, and **the aggregate amount shall be no more than the Monthly Service Fee you pay for the Service in the Service Month in which the Service fails to meet the Service Availability Standard** (the Monthly Service Fee excludes the portion deducted by vouchers, coupons, service fee reduction or exemption, etc.).

| Service Availability in a Service Month   | Value of Compensational Voucher                              |

| Less than 95%                             | **100% of the Monthly Service Fee**                    |

### 3.2 Time Limit for Compensation Application

(1) If the Service Availability in a Service Month fails to meet the Service Availability Standard, you may **apply for compensation only through the Tencent Cloud ticket system under your relevant account** after the fifth (5th) business day of the month immediately following such Service Month.
