## Feature Overview 
ClickHouse offers [internal dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/internal-dicts/) and [external dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/dictionaries/external-dictionaries/external-dicts/). The former predefines the content and the latter offers various definitions from external data sources. You can use special functions along with a dictionary for query, which is simpler and more efficient than the combination of `JOIN` and a reference table. This document describes how to use external dictionaries in the console.

## Notes
1. A data dictionary maintained in the console will take effect on all ClickHouse nodes.
2. A data dictionary added in the console can only be maintained (modified and deleted) in the console.
3. A data dictionary added using SQL commands or other backend methods cannot be maintained (modified and deleted) in the console.
4. A dictionary table created in the console will be added to the Cloud Data Warehouse global database **cdwch_{instanceId}_dictionary_database** by default.
>! Do not maintain a dictionary via both the console and other means (such as SQL commands and other backend means). Otherwise, content may be overwritten or lost (such as due to accidental deletion).

## Directions in Console
1. Log in to the [Cloud Data Warehouse console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdwch), select the target cluster in **Cluster List**, and click the **Data Dictionaries** tab on the cluster details page.
2. View the list of existing external dictionaries on the current page.

4. After the external dictionary is created, you can view, modify, and delete it in the list.

## Managing External Dictionary via SQL
1. Create a dictionary.
```
CREATE DICTIONARY [IF NOT EXISTS] [db.]dictionary_name [ON CLUSTER cluster]
(
    key1 type1  [DEFAULT|EXPRESSION expr1] [IS_OBJECT_ID],
    key2 type2  [DEFAULT|EXPRESSION expr2],
    attr1 type2 [DEFAULT|EXPRESSION expr3] [HIERARCHICAL|INJECTIVE],
    attr2 type2 [DEFAULT|EXPRESSION expr4] [HIERARCHICAL|INJECTIVE]
)
PRIMARY KEY key1, key2
SOURCE(SOURCE_NAME([param1 value1 ... paramN valueN]))
LAYOUT(LAYOUT_NAME([param_name param_value])``)
LIFETIME({MIN min_val MAX max_val | max_val})
```
2. View the dictionary.
```
SELECT * FROM system.dictionaries
```
3. Delete the dictionary.
```sql
DROP DICTIONARY <database name>.<dictionary name>
```
For more information on dictionary SQL, see [CREATE DICTIONARY](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/create/dictionary/).

## Using External Dictionary
You can query some types of dictionaries using general `SELECT`:
```sql
SELECT * FROM <database name>.<dictionary name>
```
You can also query them using dictionary functions:
```sql
dictGet('dict_name', attr_names, id_expr)
dictGetOrDefault('dict_name', attr_names, id_expr, default_value_expr)
dictGetOrNull('dict_name', attr_name, id_expr)
```

For more information on dictionary functions, see [Functions for Working with External Dictionaries](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/functions/ext-dict-functions/).
