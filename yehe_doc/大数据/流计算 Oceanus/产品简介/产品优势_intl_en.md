### Real-Time Computing
Stream Compute Service provides millisecond-level computing capabilities, supports ETL, continuous aggregation, stream join, window computing, out-of-order adjustment, CEP, online machine learning, and other complex logic scenarios, and provides accuracy guarantee through state storage and failover, helping you tackle the ever-changing business landscape with ease.

### Fully Managed Architecture
Stream Compute Service can create a cluster of hundreds of nodes in minutes. It isolates tenants completely from each other and eliminates your need to care about infrastructure scheduling and OPS. It provides rich monitoring and alarming capabilities and implements failover through timed snapshots, helping you focus on the development of analytical models to cope with rapidly changing business challenges.

### Elastic Scalability
Stream Compute Service supports the elastic scaling of computing resources, including minute-level scale-out of computing resource pools and minute-level dynamic adjustment of Flink cluster computing resources, which enables you to quickly respond to business changes and reduce the overall management costs and OPS risks.

### Easy-to-Use SQL
Stream Compute Service provides an online development environment where you can write SQL statements, check syntax, and debug, release, and deploy code online. Moreover, it enables online OPS and management, so the entire process doesn't require complex programming, which makes it much easier for you to use real-time stream computing.

### Support for UDX/Custom Programs
Stream Compute Service supports invoking the built-in UDX and running custom JAR jobs developed based on Flink DataStream, allowing you to sustain more complex business scenarios through more free development and implementation.

### Vast Cloud Ecosystem
Stream Compute Service supports a rich set of upstream and downstream ecosystem components and can be seamlessly connected with various types of data sources and purposes, including CKafka, TencentDB, CDWPG, ES, CLS, and COS.
