Terminating a monthly subscribed Oceanus cluster before it expires may result in a refund. If you have any dissatisfaction after purchasing a cluster, you can return it unconditionally within 5 days. The 5-day unconditional refund is available for only one cluster. The paid effective amount will be refunded to your Tencent Cloud account (discounts and vouchers are not refundable). In addition, you can also perform regular self-service refund. In this case, the refund calculated by deducting the usage fees from the paid amount will be credited to your account in the form of trial credit (not withdrawable or invoiceable). You can terminate and return the cluster in the [Oceanus console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/oceanus).

Refund calculation rule for regular self-service return:
**Refund = currently effective order amount + ineffective order amount - used resource value**
- Currently effective order amount: refers to the amount paid for the currently effective order, excluding discounts and vouchers.
- Ineffective order amount: refers to the amount paid for the order that will take effect in the future, excluding vouchers.

- The used resource value is calculated as follows:
- For the used cluster fees, if the usage has lasted at least one month as of the date of return, fees will be deducted by month; otherwise, fees will be deducted by day.
- The usage is accurate down to the second.
- If the refund is â‰¤ 0, it will be calculated as 0, and resources will be returned.
