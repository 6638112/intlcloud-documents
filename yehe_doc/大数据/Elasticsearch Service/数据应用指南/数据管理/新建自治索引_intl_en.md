## Prerequisites
- You have a Tencent Cloud account. For more information on how to create an account, see [Signing Up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985).
- You have created an ES cluster on v7.14.2. For more information on how to create a cluster, see [Creating Clusters](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/19536).
>! Only [autonomous indices](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/47694) can be created. Developed by Tencent Cloud, the autonomous index feature is suitable for time series data use cases such as log analysis and Ops monitoring, and can achieve index lifecycle management and automatic sharding optimization, with improved read and write efficiency. This feature is naturally applicable to clusters on v7.14.2 created after June 1, 2022 and is supported for older clusters on this version after a cluster restart. To use this feature in clusters on earlier versions, upgrade them to v7.14.2 first.

## Directions
### Step 1. Go to the "Create" page
1. Log in to the [ES console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/es) and click **Data Management** to enter the index list.
2. Click **Create index** to enter the **Create** page.

### Step 2. Enter the basic information
- Index name: It must contain 1â€“255 characters, excluding Chinese characters, uppercase letters, space, and some symbols (\, /, *, ?, ", <, >, |, #, :, and ,), and it cannot start with -, _, +, or .
- Cluster: Cluster of the index.

### Step 3. Enter the index configuration information
#### Data source configuration
1. Field mapping
	- **Dynamic creation**: It is enabled by default. After it is enabled, the collected source data will be automatically parsed to generate the field mappings of the index.
	- **Enter sample for automatic configuration**: After disabling **Dynamic creation**, you can generate the field mappings of the index through the **Enter sample for automatic configuration** input box. After you enter a JSON-formatted data sample and click **Confirm**, the platform will automatically verify the data. If there is no problem, fields will be mapped to the field mapping table. The deduction rule and sample are as follows:
**Deduction rule**: When the field value is `true` or `false`, the mapping type is `boolean`; when the field value is an integer, the mapping type is `long`; when the field value is a floating point, the mapping type is `double`; when the field value is a string with 36 or fewer characters, the mapping type is `keyword`; when the field value is a string with more than 36 characters, the mapping type is `text`; when the field value is a string in date format, the mapping type is `date`; when the field value supports nesting, the mapping type is `object`.  
Enter the following JSON-formatted data sample in the **Enter sample for automatic configuration** input box:
```
{
    "bool_field": true,
    "date_field": "2022/01/26 00:00:00",
    "double_field": 3.14,
    "keyword_field": "This is a line of text that does not require word segmentation",
    "long_field": 126,
    "object_field": {
        "sub_field": 2022
    },
    "text_field": "This is a line of text that requires word segmentation. Text with more than 36 characters will be identified as requiring word segmentation and defined as the text type"
}
```
The parsing result is as shown below:

Field mapping splits the original data into multiple segments by field (i.e., key:value) for indexing and search as follows:

| Parameter | Description |
|:-------------- |:-------------|
|<nobr>Field name | Name of the field in the written data |
| Field type | Field data type. Valid values: boolean, keyword, long, double, date, text. More field types are supported in the JSON mode. For more information, see [Field data types](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.14/mapping-types.html). |
| Include Chinese characters | This feature can be enabled if the field contains Chinese characters and you want to search for Chinese characters, but it will increase the index size. After this feature is enabled, the `ik_max_word` analyzer will be applied to the text field by default. |
| Enable index | Enabling this feature allows for creating an index for this field for search. |
| Enable statistics | Enabling this option allows for statistical analysis of field values, but it increases the index size. |

2. Time field
The time field refers to the date field in the data. This field records the data creation time and cannot be modified after the index is created.
	- **Enable index** and **Enable statistics** are enabled by default for the time field and cannot be disabled.  
	- After dynamic creation is disabled, the time field will map the date fields in the table, and you can select one from the drop-down list as the time field.

3. Write mode
Data is written to the index. This mode cannot be changed after the index is created successfully. Currently, two write modes are supported:  
	- Append write (suitable for the log case): Data will be written to the latest backing index.  
	- Shard-based write by time (suitable for the monitoring case): Data will be written in the backing index of the corresponding time period based on the time field.

#### Lifecycle configuration
1. Storage by tier
Storage by tier indicates that you can store indices on nodes with different attributes based on their access frequency. For example, you can store less-frequently queried and updated data on a warm tier for cost savings.  
The time it takes to migrate an index to a tier is calculated from the index rolling update start. 
   
2. Deletion upon expiry
The **Delete upon expiry** option supports deleting historical data based on the **Max age** and **Max size**.
	- Max age: If the write mode is **Append write**, the backing index will be deleted when the specified value is reached after the index creation time. If the write mode is **Shard-based write by time**, the backing index will be deleted when the specified value is reached after the time when no more data is written to the index.
	- Max size: When the size of the autonomous index reaches the specified value, a historical backing index will be deleted based on the applicable condition. If the write mode is **Append write**, the oldest backing index will be deleted, starting from the index creation time. If the write mode is **Shard-based write by time**, the oldest backing index will be deleted, starting from the time when no more data is written to the index.

#### Advanced settings
1. Creation parameters
	- Shard number: A shard is a partition of data stored in the index. If **Dynamic adjustment** is enabled, the shard quantity is only used as the initial value for the backing index and will be automatically adjusted to the optimal value by algorithms.
	- Shard quantity dynamic adjustment: The platform will automatically adjust the shard quantity based on the business load to keep the index under the best condition. The adjusted shard quantity will apply to backing indices that are rolled over subsequently but not to existing backing indices.
	- Replicas: The number of replica shards of each primary shard.
	- Refresh interval: The interval required for data to be searchable after it is written in the index.
  
2. Index rollover
	- Rollover cycle: From the creation date, roll the index over once in each specified cycle.
	- Rollover cycle dynamic adjustment: The platform will automatically adjust the rollover cycle based on the business load to keep the index under the best condition.

#### JSON mode
1. Feature description
Currently, you can switch to the **JSON mode** by clicking **Change to JSON mode** in the top-right corner of **Index configuration** to create an index. After a successful switch, the configuration information will be automatically synced to the UI in the corresponding mode.
