## Search and Analysis
The data management feature provides entries for quick access to the search and analysis pages. In the index list, click an entry to open the Kibana login page. After successful login, you can enter the corresponding page.

## Login
To access the Kibana page, you need to log in with the username "elastic" and the Kibana password you set when you created your cluster. If you forgot your password, you can reset it on the cluster details page. For security reasons, you can configure an access blocklist/allowlist for the public address of the Kibana page. For more information, see [ES Cluster](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/16992).
