Jointly developed by Tencent Cloud Elasticsearch Service (ES) team and Tencent Cloud NLP team, the QQ analysis plugin is widely used for Chinese text analysis among Tencent businesses such as QQ, WeChat, and QQ Browser. On the basis of traditional dictionary-based analysis, it supports features such as named-entity recognition (NER), Pinyin-Chinese character conversion, Simplified-Traditional Chinese character conversion, and custom dictionaries. Through many years of application and continuous optimization, it has become industry-leading on key metrics such as analysis accuracy and speed. You can use it in Tencent Cloud ES to analyze and search for documents.

### Notes

The QQ analysis plugin supports only clusters with data node specifications above 2-core and 4 GB MEM. If it is not installed in your cluster, please install it (`analysis-qq`) on the plugin list page.

The QQ analysis plugin provides the following analyzers and tokenizers:

* Analyzers: qq_smart, qq_max, qq_smart_ner, qq_max_ner
* Tokenizers: qq_smart, qq_max, qq_smart_ner, qq_max_ner

You can analyze and query documents by using the analyzers and tokenizers above. You can also use the dictionary configuration feature to customize and update the analysis dictionaries. For more information, please see dictionary configuration below.

>1. What is the difference between `qq_max` and `qq_smart`?
>
>   qq_max: it splits text at the finest granularity; for example, it will split "National Anthem of the People's Republic of China" into "National Anthem of the People's Republic, National Anthem, the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic, Republic of China, National, Anthem, People, Republic, China, etc.", exhaustively listing all possible combinations.
>
>   qq_smart: it splits text at the roughest granularity; for example, it will split "National Anthem of the People's Republic of China" into "National Anthem, the People's Republic of China".
>
>2. What is NER? Why does it have an independent tokenizer?
>
>   NER (named-entity recognition) can recognize entities with specific meaning in text, such as person names, place names, institution names, and other proper nouns. You do not need to upload custom dictionaries for such proper nouns. The reason why the NER feature has a separate tokenizer is that a model needs to be loaded for NER, and the first loading takes much time.



### Directions

1. Log in to the Kibana Console of the cluster where the QQ analysis plugin has been installed. For detailed directions, please see [Accessing Cluster Through Kibana](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/845/19541).

2. Click "Dev Tools" on the left sidebar.

3. Use an analyzer of the QQ analysis plugin in the console to create an index.

    ```
    PUT /index
    {
      "mappings": {
        "_doc": {
          "properties": {
            "content": {
              "type": "text",
              "analyzer": "qq_max",
              "search_analyzer": "qq_smart"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The statements above create an index named `index` in `_doc` type (for ES 7 or above, you need to add `?include_type_name=true` during index creation to support types). It contains the `content` attribute in `text` type and uses the `qq_max` and `qq_smart` analyzers.
    
    After the statements are successfully executed, the following result will be returned:
    
    ```
    {
      "acknowledged": true,
      "shards_acknowledged": true,
      "index": "index"
    }
    ```

4. Add some documents.

    ```
    POST /index/_doc/1
    {
      "content": "I downloaded the Honor of Kings from WeChat"
    }
    
    POST /index/_doc/2
    {
      "content": "Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development: to complete landscape resource registration of famous towns and villages by the end of September"
    }
    
    POST /index/_doc/3
    {
      "content": "Latest weather forecast from China Meteorological Administration"
    }
    
    POST /index/_doc/4
    {
      "content": "I live near ICOMOS China"
    }
    ```
    
    The statements above import four documents, and the `qq_max` analyzer will be used to analyze them.
    
5. Query the documents by highlighting keywords.

    ```
    GET index/_search
    {
      "query" : { "match" : { "content" : "China" }},
      "highlight" : {
        "pre_tags" : ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
        "post_tags" : ["</tag1>", "</tag2>"],
        "fields" : {"content": {}}
      }
    }
    ```
    
    The statements above are used to search for the documents in `_doc` type whose `content` field contains "China" by using the `qq_smart` analyzer.
    
    After the statements are successfully executed, the following result will be returned:
    
    ```
    {
      "took" : 108,
      "timed_out" : false,
      "_shards" : {
        "total" : 1,
        "successful" : 1,
        "skipped" : 0,
        "failed" : 0
      },
      "hits" : {
        "total" : {
          "value" : 2,
          "relation" : "eq"
        },
        "max_score" : 0.7199211,
        "hits" : [
          {
            "_index" : "index",
            "_type" : "_doc",
            "_id" : "4",
            "_score" : 0.7199211,
            "_source" : {
              "content" : "I live near ICOMOS China"
            },
            "highlight" : {
              "content" : [
                "I live near ICOMOS <tag1>China</tag1>"
              ]
            }
          },
          {
            "_index" : "index",
            "_type" : "_doc",
            "_id" : "3",
            "_score" : 0.6235748,
            "_source" : {
              "content" : "Latest weather forecast from China Meteorological Administration"
            },
            "highlight" : {
              "content" : [
                "Latest weather forecast from <tag1>China</tag1> Meteorological Administration"
              ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```
    
### Using Custom Dictionary

The QQ analysis plugin allows you to configure custom dictionaries. After being uploaded, a dictionary will trigger rolling restart of the cluster; therefore, please ensure that the cluster is in GREEN status and there are no single-replica indices.

1. On the cluster list page, click a cluster ID to enter the cluster details page.

2. Click **Plugin List** to enter the plugin list management page.

3. Find the QQ analysis plugin (`analysis-qq`) and click **Update Dictionary** on the right.

4. The dictionary file must meet the following requirements:

    * A dictionary file must be encoded in UTF-8, contain one word per line, and have the `.dic` extension.
    
    * You are allowed to upload a maximum of 10 files of up to 10 MB in size each.

5. Click "Save". Cluster restart will not be triggered immediately, but cluster change will be triggered after several minutes for the dictionary file to take effect.
   
### Troubleshooting and Testing

If the returned result of the QQ analysis plugin does not meet your expectations, you can run the following statements to troubleshoot and test the analyzers and tokenizers:

```
GET _analyze
{
  "text": "I live near ICOMOS China",
  "analyzer": "qq_max"
}

GET _analyze
{
  "text": "I live near ICOMOS China",
  "tokenizer": "qq_smart"
}
```
