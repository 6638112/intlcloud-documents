Log in to the [ES Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/es), select a cluster, and enter the **Plugin List** tab on the cluster details page. You can see the IK analysis plugin pre-installed in the cluster by default. For more information on this plugin, please see [IK Analysis Plugin for Elasticsearch](https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik). You can use it to create an index of Chinese keywords for your data stored in the ES cluster to implement searches.

### Requirements for Dictionary File  
- **Dictionary type:** there are two types of dictionaries: "customized dictionary" and "stopword dictionary". The "customized dictionary" specifies IK as the analyzer when data is stored to the ES cluster for index creation. If the stored data contains a word in this dictionary, an index will be created and can be queried and found by using keywords. "Stopwords" will be deliberately avoided and will not be indexed.  
- **Restrictions and requirements:** there are certain restrictions and requirements for dictionary files. For example, a dictionary file should contain one word per line and be encoded in UTF-8. For avoidance of confusion, the name of a customized dictionary file should not be the same as that of a stopword dictionary file. In addition, as dictionary files will be loaded into the memory, you are allowed to upload a maximum of 10 files of up to 10 MB in size each.  
- **Update process:** the list displays the dictionaries that have been uploaded and updated. A new dictionary will be blocked during upload if it does not meet the requirements. After a file is uploaded, it will be displayed in "pending activation" status. After all dictionaries to be updated are uploaded, click **Save**, and they will be saved to your cluster and take effect. If there is a file that fails to be uploaded or is not in UTF-8 format, a failure will be prompted, and you need to delete the failing file before you can click Save for other ones to take effect.
