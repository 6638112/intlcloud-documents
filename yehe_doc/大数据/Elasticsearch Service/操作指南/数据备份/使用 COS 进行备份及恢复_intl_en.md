## Creating a Repository
You can create a repository by running the following command:
```
PUT _snapshot/my_cos_backup
{
    "type": "cos",
    "settings": {
        "app_id": "xxxxxxx",
        "access_key_id": "xxxxxx",
        "access_key_secret": "xxxxxxx",
        "bucket": "xxxxxx",
        "region": "ap-guangzhou",
        "compress": true,
        "chunk_size": "500mb",
        "base_path": "/"
    }
}
```
- app_id: APPID of your Tencent Cloud account.
- access_key_id: SecretId of your Tencent Cloud API key.
- access_key_secret: SecretKey of your Tencent Cloud API ley.
- bucket: COS bucket name, **which cannot contain the `-{appId}` prefix**.
- region: COS bucket region, **which must be the same region as that of the ES cluster**. For more information about regions, see [Regions and Availability Zones](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/6091).
- compressï¼štrue by default, which means the stored index metadata will be compressed.
- base_path: Backup directory.   

## Listing Repository Information
You can get repository information via `GET _snapshot` or get the information of a specified repository via `GET _snapshot/my_cos_backup`.

## Creating a Snapshot Backup

### Backing up all indices
Back up all indices in the ES cluster to the repository `my_cos_backup` and name it `snapshot_1`.
```
PUT _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1
```
This command will return a response immediately and be executed asynchronously in the background until the end. If you want to wait for the execution to complete before returning, you can add the `wait_for_completion` parameter. **The duration of the command execution depends on the index size**.
```
PUT _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1?wait_for_completion=true
```

### Backing up specified indices
You can specify the indices to be backed up when creating a snapshot. **If the value of the `indices` parameter is multiple indices, they should be separated by `,` with no spaces.**
```
PUT _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_2
{
    "indices": "index_1,index_2"
}
```

## Querying a Snapshot
Query the information of a single snapshot:
```
GET _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1
```
This command returns the information about the snapshot:
>?When the value of the `state` field is `SUCCESS`, the snapshot backup is completed.
>
```
{
    "snapshots": [
        {
            "snapshot": "snapshot_1",
            "uuid": "zUSugNiGR-OzH0CCcgcLmQ",
            "version_id": 5060499,
            "version": "5.6.4",
            "indices": [
                "index_1",
                "index_2"
            ],
            "state": "SUCCESS",
            "start_time": "2018-05-04T11:44:15.975Z",
            "start_time_in_millis": 1525434255975,
            "end_time": "2018-05-04T11:45:29.395Z",
            "end_time_in_millis": 1525434329395,
            "duration_in_millis": 73420,
            "failures": [],
            "shards": {
                "total": 3,
                "failed": 0,
                "successful": 3
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Deleting a Snapshot
Delete a specified snapshot:
```
DELETE _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1
```

>!If the creation of the snapshot hasn't been competed, the snapshot deletion command will still be executed and cancel the creation of the snapshot.

## Restoring Indices from a Snapshot
1. Restore all indices backed up in a snapshot to the ES cluster:
```
POST _snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
```
 - If `snapshot_1` contains five indices, all of them will be restored to the ES cluster.   
 - You can also rename the indices through an additional option which allows you to match the index name by pattern and provide a new name through the restoration process. Use this option if you want to restore old data to verify the content or perform other operations without replacing existing data.

2. Restore a single index from a snapshot and provide an alternate name:
```
POST /_snapshot/my_cos_backup/snapshot_1/_restore
{
    "indices": "index_1",
    "rename_pattern": "index_(.+)",
    "rename_replacement": "restored_index_$1"
}
```
 - indices: Only restores `index_1` and ignores other indices in the snapshot.
 - rename_pattern: Finds the index being restored that can be matched by the specified pattern.
 - rename_replacement: Renames the matching index to the name specified in this parameter.   

## Querying the Status of Snapshot Restoration
You can check the status of snapshot restoration and monitor the progress by running the `_recovery` command.   
1. You can call the following API separately in the specified index to be restored:
```
GET index_1/_recovery
```
2. This command will return the restoration status of each shard of the specified index:
```

 - type: Describes the nature of the restoration, which means this shard is restored from a snapshot.
 - source: Describes the specific snapshot and repository as the source of restoration.
 - percent: Describes the restoration status. 94% of the files in the particular shard has now been restored, so it will be completely restored soon.   

The output lists all the indices that are being restored and all the shards in them. Each shard contains statistics such as the start/stop time, duration, percentage of restoration, and number of bytes transferred.

## Canceling Snapshot Restoration
```
DELETE /restored_index_1
```
If `restored\_index\_1` is being restored, this deletion command will stop the restoration and delete all data that has been restored to the cluster.
