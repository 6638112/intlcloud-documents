### Typical use cases
**Batch log query**
Unlike the typical practice of storing enterprise log data as JSON and text files, you can store data in COS and then use standard SQL statements through Data Lake Compute to batch query and analyze massive amounts of data, with data reports generated quickly. In this way, Data Lake Compute visualizes your data and boosts your productivity. With a few simple configurations, you can also import cloud-based log service data into a data lake for agile analysis.
### Service benefits
- Cost-effective: Data Lake Compute is pay-as-you-go, allowing you to precisely control costs through its cloud-native data lake architecture with separated storage and computing.
- Easy-to-use: You can easily get started with Data Lake Compute for faster queries through the unified SQL syntax.

## Agile Setup of a Data Middleend
Data Lake Compute is a new data architecture with closed-loop big data analysis that is lightweight, agile, easy-to-use, and cost-effective. It has a unified metadata management view that allows you to break through data silos. It combines the strengths of many cloud-based big data services to accommodate real-time and offline data analysis scenarios and comprehensively solve a wide range of data problems. Moreover, with convenient and swift data flows, it features many of the capabilities and advantages of different cloud services, making it an ideal option for enterprises setting up a data middleend.

### Typical use cases
**Unified metadata view**
Data Lake Compute enables you to unify all of your different metadata views such as EMR and other data sources into one. In this way, you can manage and use metadata from different sources in a centralized manner, build your metadata center with agility, and switch between products and versions seamlessly. Specifically, you can easily reuse the same metadata across products like Data Lake Compute and EMR.

**Agile and versatile data analysis**
In the big data ecosystem, Presto excels in performing interactive analysis while Spark does well in ETL tasks. Data Lake Compute provides unified syntax and lightweight clustering capabilities, so the same data can go seamlessly between engines in different scenarios. It also works with WeData so data can be imported from and exported to dozens of products and data sources, such as EMR, CDW, ES, TencentDB, and CLS. This makes the most out of the strengths of each product through convenient data flows.
### Service benefits
- Out-of-the-box service: Unnecessary Ops tasks and costs are saved.
- Metadata management: Multiple data sources are supported to unify metadata management and break through data silos.
- Full coverage: Data Lake Compute comprehensively covers data analysis and application scenarios, specifically, data integration, synergy, scheduling, development, and governance.

## Agile and Federated Data Lake Analysis
Data Lake Compute helps you seamlessly transition from database to big data scenarios, where you can query and analyze multi-source heterogeneous data in the cloud from object storage, database, and other services. Its unified data view and standard SQL capabilities speed up federated data query and analysis, breaking down data silos while fully tapping into the value of data.

### Typical use cases
**Cross-business federated data query**
Enterprise departments and business lines often use different data architectures for their specific business systems. This means business data is dispersed in different storage systems, for example, transaction data in relational databases, active data in Redis, and historical records in object storage. With Data Lake Compute, you can align and analyze heterogeneous data from multiple sources to utilize your cross-business data more quickly.
### Service benefits
- Out-of-the-box: There is no need to set up data transfer pipelines, so unnecessary Ops and costs are saved.
- Secure and efficient: The permission management system is unified and refined to the column level, making queries super fast.
- Easy-to-use: Cross-business analysis can be easily implemented without programming language adaptation.
