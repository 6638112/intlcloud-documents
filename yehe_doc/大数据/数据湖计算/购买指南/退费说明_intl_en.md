>! Self-service return is supported only for monthly subscribed private data engines. You don't need to return pay-as-you-go engines, as you can delete or suspend them to stop billing. Public engines won't incur fees when they are idle, so there is no need to return them.

### Self-service return
- Once returned, a data engine will be isolated. During the isolation period, it will be unavailable, with the data retained though.
- You can renew the isolated data engine on the **Billing Center** page in the **Tencent Cloud console** to recover it.
- **You cannot return the data engine again within six hours after you renew and recover it from isolation.**
- The isolation period is seven days. After it elapses, the system will terminate the data engine permanently.
- The system will notify your Tencent Cloud account creator, global resource collaborators, and financial collaborators by email and SMS when your data engine is terminated.
