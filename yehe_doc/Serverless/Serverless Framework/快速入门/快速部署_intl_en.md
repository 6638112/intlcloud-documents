### Information viewing

If you want to check the deployment status and resources of the application again, you can go to the folder where the project is successfully deployed and run the following command to view the corresponding information:

```
$ cd express-app # Enter the project directory
$ sls info
```
>?`sls` is short for the `serverless` command.

### Development and debugging

By running the `sls dev` command, you can enable real-time logging of the deployment. This feature will automatically monitor local code updates, sync them to the cloud for deployment, and output invocation logs in real time. For applications on Node.js 10, you can also enable in-cloud debugging. For more information, please see [In-cloud Debugging for Node.js](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1040/36860).

```
$ cd express-app
$ sls dev
```

### Removing project

You can remove all resources deployed in the cloud by running the `sls remove` command as follows:

```
$ cd express-app # Enter the project directory
$ sls remove

## FAQs
If a proxy is configured in your environment, the following problems may occur:

- Problem 1: the guide does not pop up by default when `serverless` is entered.
Solution: add the `SERVERLESS_PLATFORM_VENDOR=tencent` configuration item to the `.env` file.

- Problem 2: after `sls deploy` is entered, the deployment reports a network error.
Solution: add the following proxy configuration to the `.env` file.
```
HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:12345 # Your proxy
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:12345 # Your proxy
```
