### What is the difference between Serverless Framework and SCF?
[Serverless Cloud Function (SCF)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583) provides a serverless execution environment, enabling companies and developers to execute code without the need to purchase and manage servers.
Serverless Framework provides a serverless application framework combining SCF, API Gateway, COS, TencentDB, and other resources that enables you to write business logic directly while skipping over configuration and management of underlying resources.
