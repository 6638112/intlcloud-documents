### Account configuration (optional)

Currently, you can scan a QR code to log in to the CLI by default. If you want to configure persistent environment variables/key information, you can also create a local `.env` file:

```console
touch .env # Tencent Cloud configuration information
```

Configure Tencent Cloud's `SecretId` and `SecretKey` information in the `.env` file and save it:
```
# .env
TENCENT_SECRET_ID=123
TENCENT_SECRET_KEY=123
```

> - If you don't have a Tencent Cloud account yet, please [sign up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/register) first.
> - If you already have a Tencent Cloud account, you can get `SecretId` and `SecretKey` in [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi).
