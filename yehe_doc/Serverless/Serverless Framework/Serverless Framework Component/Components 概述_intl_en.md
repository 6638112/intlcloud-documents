Serverless Components is a scenario-based solution that supports orchestration and organization of multiple cloud resources for different use cases such as Express framework integration and website deployment. It can greatly simplify the configuration and management of cloud resources while interconnecting Tencent Cloud products such as gateways, COS, and CAM, so that you can focus more on your business development.

For more information, please see [Serverless Components on GitHub](https://github.com/serverless/components/blob/master/README.cn.md).

### Serverless Components Advantages

- **Ease of use**
Serverless Components is built around your scenarios (e.g., websites, blogs, payment systems, and image services). It abstracts underlying infrastructure configuration and enables you to implement your business scenarios with simple configurations.
- **Reusability**
A serverless component can be easily created and deployed through a very simple `serverless.yml` file. Plus, its JavaScript library `serverless.js` supports extension and reuse with simple syntax.
- **Fast deployment**
The deployment of most serverless components is about 20 times faster than traditional configuration tools. They allow rapid deployment and remote verification which help effectively reduce the workload of local emulation and debugging.
