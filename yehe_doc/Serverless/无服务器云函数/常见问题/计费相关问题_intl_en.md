### Why are fees billed within the free tier?

SCF users are entitled to a certain free tier of resource usage and invocations each month. However, there is no free tier for **public network outbound traffic**. Please check whether the billing description indicates public network outbound traffic fees.

### Why are public network outbound traffic fees incurred only in this month when the function is executing for a long time without update?

- You can view the public network outbound traffic statistics through the SCF monitoring data.
- The payment will be deducted from the account as long as the aggregate amount reaches two decimal places.
