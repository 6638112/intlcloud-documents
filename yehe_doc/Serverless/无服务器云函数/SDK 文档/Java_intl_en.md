## Overview
* Welcome to Tencent Cloud Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.0, a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. SDK 3.0 is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
* This document describes how to use, debug, and connect to TencentCloud APIs with the SDK for Java 3.0 as an example.
* This version currently supports various [Tencent Cloud services](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/sdk/Description) such as CVM, VPC, and CBS and will support more services in the future.

## Dependent Environment

* JDK 7 and above.
* Get the security credential, which consists of `SecretId` and `SecretKey`. `SecretId` is used to identify the API requester, while `SecretKey` is a key used for signature string encryption and authentication by the server. You can get them on the [API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) page as shown below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/8ec140474be0ced1352695b372b2934d.png)
>!**Your security credential represents your account identity and granted permissions, which is equivalent to your login password. Do not disclose it to others.**
* Get the calling address (endpoint), which is generally in the format of `*.tencentcloudapi.com` and varies by service. For example, the endpoint of CVM is `cvm.tencentcloudapi.com`. For specific endpoints, please see the [API documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/api) of the corresponding service.

## Installing SDK[](id:p1)
### Method 1. Install through Maven (recommended)
Maven is a dependency management tool for Java that supports the dependencies your project requires and installs them into your project.
1. Go to [Maven official website](https://maven.apache.org/) to download the corresponding Maven installation package for your system and install it. Fore more information on Maven, please see [Welcome to Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
2. Add Maven dependencies for your project by adding the following dependencies under the `<dependencies>` tag in Maven's `pom.xml`. You can find the latest version (v3.1.322) in the [Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java).
```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.tencentcloudapi</groupId>
     <artifactId>tencentcloud-sdk-java</artifactId>
     <!-- go to https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java and get the latest version. -->
     <!-- Please query the latest version at https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java, which is as follows -->
     <version>3.1.322</version>
</dependency>
```
	>!
	>- The version number here is just an example, and you can view the latest version number in the [Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java).
	>- v4.0.11 shown in the [Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java) was disused but has not been completely deleted due to the Maven index update issue.
	>- The above import method downloads the SDKs of all Tencent Cloud products to your local system. You can replace the `artifactId` with a specific product SDK name such as `tencentcloud-sdk-java-cvm/cbs/vpc` to import the SDK of the specific product. The code can be used in the same way, and the major packages are the same. For more information, please see the samples. The latest version can also be queried in the [Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/search?q=tencentcloud-sdk-java), which can greatly save the storage space.
3. Set the mirror source to speed up the download. To do so, edit the `settings.xml` configuration file of Maven and add the mirror configuration in the `mirrors` section:
```
    <mirror>
      <id>tencent</id>
      <name>tencent maven mirror</name>
      <url>https://mirrors.tencent.com/nexus/repository/maven-public/</url>
      <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>
    </mirror>
```

### Method 2. Install through source package
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java) to download the source code package.
2. Decompress the source package to an appropriate location in your project.
3. You need to put the jar package under the `vendor` directory in a path that can be found by Java.
4. For importing methods, please see the sample.

## Using SDK
The following uses the instance querying API `DescribeInstances` as an example:

         try {
             Credential cred = new Credential("secretId", "secretKey");
             CvmClient client = new CvmClient(cred, "ap-shanghai");

            DescribeInstancesRequest req = new DescribeInstancesRequest();
             DescribeInstancesResponse resp = client.DescribeInstances(req);

            System.out.println(DescribeInstancesResponse.toJsonString(resp));
         } catch (TencentCloudSDKException e) {
            System.out.println(e.toString());
         }
     }
}

### More samples

You can find more detailed samples in the `examples` directory on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java).

## Relevant Configuration

### Proxy[](id:p3)

Starting from v3.0.96, an HTTP proxy can be set separately: 

```
HttpProfile httpProfile = new HttpProfile();
httpProfile.setProxyHost("real proxy IP");
httpProfile.setProxyPort(real proxy port);
```

### Language

Starting from v3.1.16, we add the support for the common parameter `Language` to meet the globalization requirements of certain products. As before, `Language` is not passed in by default subject to the decisions of each service API, which is usually Chinese but can also be English by default in some products. Currently, valid values are Chinese and English, which can be set in the following way:

```
import com.tencentcloudapi.common.profile.ClientProfile;
import com.tencentcloudapi.common.profile.Language;
...
    ClientProfile clientProfile = new ClientProfile();
    clientProfile.setLanguage(Language.ZH_CN);
```

### Support for HTTP

The SDK supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, and the switch between protocols can be implemented by setting the `setProtocol()` method in `HttpProfile`:

```
      HttpProfile httpProfile = new HttpProfile();
      httpProfile.setProtocol("http://"); // HTTP protocol
      httpProfile.setProtocol("https://"); // HTTPS protocol
```

## Support for Log Printout
Starting from v3.1.80, the SDK supports printing logs.
First, when creating the `ClientProfile` object, set the `debug` mode to true, and the SDK exception information and traffic information will be printed.
```
      ClientProfile clientProfile = new ClientProfile();
      clientProfile.setDebug(true);
```

Tencent Cloud SDK for Java uses the `commons.logging` class to print logs as shown below:

```
September 10, 2020 5:14:30 PM com.tencentcloudapi.cvm.v20170312.CvmClient info

```
You can configure the log printout class as needed, such as `log4j`, in the following way:
+ Configure the `pom` file and set the `log4j` version.
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>log4j</groupId>
      <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.17</version>
    </dependency>
```
+ Set the environment variable to `log4j` and create a log class.
```
System.setProperty("org.apache.commons.logging.Log", "org.apache.commons.logging.impl.Log4JLogger");
Log logger = LogFactory.getLog("TestLog");
logger.info("hello world");
```

## Legacy SDK

We recommend you use the new version of SDK. If you need a legacy version, add the following dependencies to your Maven's `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
<groupId>com.qcloud</groupId>
<artifactId>qcloud-java-sdk</artifactId>
<version>2.0.6</version>
</dependency>
```



## FAQs
### Version upgrade

Please note that upgrading from v3.0.x to 3.1.x causes compatibility issues. As `integer` fields have been modified to `long` type, the project needs to be recompiled.

### Dependency conflict

Currently, the SDK depends on OkHttp 2.5.0. If it is mixed with other packages that depend on OkHttp 3, an error may be reported, such as `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: okio.BufferedSource.rangeEquals(JLokio/ByteString;)Z`. The reason is that OkHttp 3 depends on Okio 1.12.0, while OkHttp 2.5.0 depends on Okio 1.6.0. When Maven parses dependencies, it gives top priority to the shortest path in sequence, so if the SDK is declared in the pom.xml dependency first, Okio 1.6.0 will be used, and an error will be reported.

Solution before the SDK is upgraded to OkHttp 3:

1. Clearly specify the dependency on Okio 1.12.0 in pom.xml:
>?There may be other packages that require a higher version, in which case, take the highest compatible version as a workaround; for example, when other packages use OkHttp 4, the corresponding version may be Okio 2.2.2.

```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.squareup.okio</groupId>
      <artifactId>okio</artifactId>
      <version>1.12.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

2. Put the SDK at the end of the dependency (note that if it has been compiled before, you need to delete the OkHttp package cached by Maven first). Taking the CMQ SDK that depends on OkHttp 3 as an example, the format is as follows (pay attention to the workaround version number):
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.qcloud</groupId>
      <artifactId>cmq-http-client</artifactId>
      <version>1.0.7</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.tencentcloudapi</groupId>
      <artifactId>tencentcloud-sdk-java</artifactId>
      <version>3.1.59</version>
    </dependency>
```

### Certificate issue

Certificate issues are usually caused by incorrect configuration of the client environment. The SDK does not manipulate the certificate and relies on the processing by the Java runtime environment itself. After a certificate issue occurs, you can run `-Djavax.net.debug=ssl` to enable detailed logs for troubleshooting.

Some users reported that the certificate error `javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure` occurred while using IBM JDK 1.8. The error was resolved after Oracle JDK was used.

## Common Client

Starting from v3.1.303, Tencent Cloud SDK for Java supports the use of `Common Client` mode for requests. You only need to install the `Common` package to initiate calls to any Tencent Cloud product.

>?You must clearly know the parameters required by the called API; otherwise, the call may fail.

Currently, only the POST method is supported, and the signature algorithm must be signature algorithm v3. For detailed usage, please see the [Using Common Client to Call](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java/tree/master/examples/common/CommonClient) sample.


## Support for Request Retry

Starting from v3.1.310, Tencent Cloud SDK for Java supports request retry. For each request, you can set the number of retries between 0 and 10. If an API request fails, it will be retried at intervals of 1s until it succeeds or the number of retries is used up.

For detailed usage, please see the [Using `retry` to Retry Request](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java/blob/master/examples/common/retry/Retry.java) sample.

## Credential Management

Tencent Cloud SDK for Java currently supports the following methods for credential management:

### Environment variable

By default, the environment variables `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID` and `TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY` are read to get `secretId` and `secretKey`. The relevant code is as follows:

```java
Credential cred = new EnvironmentVariableCredentialsProvider().getCredentials();
```

### Configuration file

The configuration file path should be as follows:

+ Windows: `c:\Users\NAME\.tencentcloud\credentials`
+ Linux: `~/.tencentcloud/credentials` or `/etc/tencentcloud/credentials`

The configuration file is in the following format:

```ini
[default]
secret_id = xxxxx
secret_key = xxxxx
```

The relevant code is as follows:

```java
Credential cred = new ProfileCredentialsProvider().getCredentials();
```

### Role assumption

For related concepts of role assumption, please see [Role Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/19420).

To use this method, you must create a role in the Tencent Cloud CAM console as instructed in [Creating a Role](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/19381).

After you have a role, you can get temporary credentials through the persistent key and `roleArn`, and the SDK will automatically refresh the temporary credentials. The relevant code is as follows:

```java
Credential cred = new STSCredential("secretId", "secretKey", "roleArn", "roleSessionName");
```

### Instance role

For related concepts of instance role, please see [Managing Roles](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/38290).

After you bind a role to an instance, you can access the relevant metadata APIs on the instance to get temporary credentials, and the SDK will automatically refresh the temporary credentials. The relevant code is as follows:

```java
Credential cred = new CvmRoleCredential();
```

### Credential supply chain

Tencent Cloud SDK for Java provides a credential supply chain. By default, it will try to get credentials in the order of environment variable -> configuration file -> instance role and return the first obtained credential. The relevant code is as follows:

```java
Credential cred = new DefaultCredentialsProvider().getCredentials();
```

For detailed usage of credential management, please see the [Using Credential Supply Chain](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-java/blob/master/examples/common/credential_manager/CredentialManager.java) sample.
