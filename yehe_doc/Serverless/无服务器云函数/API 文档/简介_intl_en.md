Welcome to Tencent Cloud Serverless Cloud Function (SCF). SCF is a Function as a Service (FaaS) service that hosts and runs your code with user-configured triggers. With SCF, you can define triggers and SCF will run your application code in response to events you have defined.

SCF is a serverless execution environment provided by Tencent Cloud. You can easily run your code in a secure and elastic manner on the Tencent Cloud infrastructure by compiling key code in the language supported by SCF and setting the running conditions without purchasing and managing servers. Tencent Cloud completely manages the underlying computing resources, such as server CPU, memory, and network, and other configurations, and supports resource maintenance, code deployment, auto scaling, and load balancing. Code is run on demand, with no service fee incurred during idle time.
