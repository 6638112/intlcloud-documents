## Billing Modes and Billable Items

SCF is pay-as-you-go **hourly** in **USD**.

SCF is billed according to the following four parts. Each part is billed according to its statistics and calculation method, and the fees in **USD** are accurate to two decimal places:

**Resource usage fees**: resource usage is calculated in GBs by multiplying the configured function memory size by the function execution duration.
**Invocation fees**: each function triggering and execution is calculated as an invocation.
**Public network outbound fees**: the outbound traffic consumed when the function code accesses the public network is counted as the public network outbound traffic in GB.
**Idle provisioned concurrency fees**: the number of idle instances is calculated by subtracting the number of actually running concurrent instances from the number of launched provisioned instances, and the idle resource usage is calculated in GBs by multiplying the number of idle instances by the configured memory size.

For more information, please see [Billing Mode](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/12284).
