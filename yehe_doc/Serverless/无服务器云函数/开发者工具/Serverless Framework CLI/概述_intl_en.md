## Overview
Well-received in the industry, Serverless Framework allows you to deploy a complete, available serverless application framework without the need to care about underlying resources. It features resource orchestrating, auto scaling, and event driving and covers the full development lifecycle from coding and debugging to testing and deploying, helping you quickly build serverless applications with the aid of Tencent Cloud resources.

## Serverless Framework Components
Serverless Components is a scenario-based solution that supports orchestration and organization of multiple cloud resources for different use cases such as Express framework integration and website deployment. It can greatly simplify the configuration and management of cloud resources while interconnecting Tencent Cloud products such as gateways, COS, and CAM, so that you can focus more on your business development. For more information, please see [Serverless Components](https://github.com/serverless/components/blob/master/README.cn.md) on GitHub.

### Benefits and features
- **Ease of use**
Serverless Components is built around your scenarios (e.g., websites, blogs, payment systems, and image services). It abstracts underlying infrastructure configuration and enables you to implement your business scenarios with simple configurations.
- **Reusability**
A serverless component can be easily created and deployed through a very simple `serverless.yml` file. Plus, its JavaScript library `serverless.js` supports extension and reuse with simple syntax.
- **Fast deployment**
The deployment of most serverless components is about 20 times faster than traditional configuration tools. They allow rapid deployment and remote verification which help effectively reduce the workload of local emulation and debugging.

### SCF component
The SCF component of [Tencent Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/components/tree/cloud) enables you to quickly package and deploy your function projects. Based on serverless services (functions, triggers, etc.) in the cloud, it can implement "zero" configuration, convenient development, and rapid deployment of your first function. It supports a rich set of configuration extensions and provides easy-to-use, low-cost, and elastically scalable cloud-based function development, configuration, and deployment capabilities.


## Getting Started
You can quickly get started with Serverless Framework CLI as instructed in [Creating Function on CLI](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/32743).
