>?SCF was fully connected to [CLS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614) on January 29, 2021, invocation logs of newly created functions have been delivered to CLS by default since then, and logs can be output in real time. If your function was created before January 29, 2021, but you need to search for and deliver logs, please do so as instructed in this document.



## Overview

When SCF is used for function computation, a large number of function execution logs will be generated. You can view and search for logs generated in the last 15 days in **Log Query** > **Advanced Retrieval** in the [SCF console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/index?rid=1).

>! The advanced search feature is currently in beta test. It is visible only to certain functions and can search for logs collected after it was launched. For more information, please see [Log Search Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/583/39777).

If you need to persistently store, deliver, or consume logs and monitor and set alarms on log content, you can deliver logs to the CLS platform as shown below:

## Prerequisites

Before using the SCF real-time log service, you need to activate [CLS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/cls) first.





## Directions

### Creating logset and log topic

Log in to the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls) and [create a logset and log topic](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/31592). This document uses the creation of the `SCF-test` logset and log topic in Guangzhou as an example as shown below:

>!For the logset region, please select the region where the SCF service is located. Cross-region log push is not supported currently.

5. Click **Save** to connect to the CLS platform.

### Enabling index

>? Log retrieval depends on the index configuration of the log topic. Please enable the index as instructed below:

1. Log in to the CLS console and select **[Logset](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/logset)** on the left sidebar.
2. Click the ID of a created logset to enter the **Basic Info** page.
3. Select **Manage** on the right of the log topic row to enter the **Basic Info** page of the log topic.
4. On the **Basic Info** page of the log topic, click **Index Configuration** as shown below:

For more information on other features such as real-time log search, delivery, and consumption, please see the [CLS documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). These features can be used in the [CLS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls) directly.


### Sample real-time search

>?Before using the real-time search feature, please make sure that your SCF log service has been connected to the CLS platform and the index has been enabled for the log topic to be searched.

1. Log in to the CLS console and select **[Log Search](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cls/search)** on the left sidebar.
2. On the **Search and Analysis** page, select the desired log topic and time and enter the search syntax in the input box. This document uses `START` as an example.
   The search syntax supports keyword search, fuzzy search, range search, and other search methods. For more information, please see [Legacy CLS Search Syntax](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/37882).
3. Click **Search and Analysis** to view real-time log information.
