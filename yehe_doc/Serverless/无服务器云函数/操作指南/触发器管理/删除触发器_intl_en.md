You can disassociate a function from an event source by deleting a trigger in the console. After disassociation, the event source will no longer trigger the function.

## Deleting Trigger in Console
1. Log in to the SCF Console and select **[Functions](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/scf/list)** on the left sidebar.
2. At the top of the "Functions" page, select the region and namespace where the function for which to delete a trigger resides.

The function list contains the function name, monitoring information, runtime environment, creation time, and modification time.
3. Click the function name to enter the function details page.
The function details page contains the function configuration, function code, triggers, logs, and monitoring tabs.
4. Select the **Triggers** tab to enter the trigger browsing and operation page.
