### Updating function configuration on Serverless Framework CLI
1. If you want to modify the function configuration, you can directly modify the `serverless.yml` configuration file under the function root directory as shown below:
```yml
# serverless.yml
component: scf # Name of the imported component, which is required. The `tencent-scf` component is used in this example
name: scfdemo # Name of the instance created by this component, which is required
org: test # Organization information, which is optional. The default value is the `appid` of your Tencent Cloud account
app: scfApp # SCF application name, which is optional
stage: dev # Information for identifying environment, which is optional. The default value is `dev`
inputs:
  name: scfFunctionName
  src: ./src
  runtime: Nodejs10.15 # Runtime environment of function. Valid values: Python2.7, Python3.6, Nodejs6.10, Nodejs8.9,Nodejs12.16, Nodejs10.15, PHP5, PHP7, Golang1, Java8.
  region: ap-guangzhou
  handler: index.main_handler
  events:
    - apigw:
        name: serverless_api
        parameters:
          protocols:
            - http
            - https
          serviceName:

          endpoints:
            - path: /index
              method: GET
```
2. After the modification is completed, run `sls deploy` on Serverless Framework CLI to deploy the function.
