## Overview
An SCF function version contains function code and configuration. In the actual development process, you can minimize the impact on your business systems by publishing a version with fixed function code and configuration.

## Related Concepts
### Latest version ($LATEST)

After a function is created, it has a latest version ($LATEST) by default. The configuration and code of the `$LATEST` version can be modified. At the time of release, such configuration and code will be used as the basis to generate a new version.
