## Overview

This document describes how to create a policy to rectify an error according to the error information. After the error is rectified, the sub-account will be able to manage the resources of the root account within the scope of the newly configured permissions.

## Example

When a sub-account associated with the `QcloudCVMReadOnlyAccess` policy attempts to reinstall a CVM, the following error is reported:

If you want to authorize the sub-account to proceed with this operation, you can create and associate a custom policy based on the error information.

## Prerequisites

Your account is a root account or a sub-account with full read-write access (QcloudCamFullAccess).

## Directions

1. Log in to the CAM console and go to [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy). Click **Create Custom Policy**.
2. In the pop-up window, click **Create by Policy Generator** to go to the **Edit Policy** page.
3. On the **Edit Policy** page, set the following information:[](id:3)
   ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/47c01e7efc774f59c23c8f6d3568db78.png)

> - Effect (required): Select **Allow** or **Deny**. In this example, select **Allow**.
> - Service (required): Select the product by short name to authorize. In this example, it will be **cvm** referenced in the operation field in the error information.
> - Action (required): select the action to authorize. In this example, select **ResetInstance** corresponding to the `operation` field in the error information.
>- Resource (required): for products that don't support resource-level authorization, you can only select all resources as the authorization granularity. For products that support resource-level authorization, you can select a specific resource. To do so, click **Add a 6-segment resource description** and enter the resource prefix and resource. In this example, the error message is for a specific resource, so you need to authorize it: select the specific resource, click **Add a 6-segment resource description**, and then you can directly copy the prefix and resource in `qcs:id/1158313:cvm:ap-guangzhou:uin/2159973417:instance/instance/ins-esuithv2` and paste them.
> - Condition (optional): Set the conditions that are required for the permissions to be effective, such as a specified access IP. This is left blank in this example.

4. Click **Next** to go to the **Associate Users/User Groups** page.
5. On the **Associate Users/User Groups** page, add the policy name (automatically generated by the console) and description.

>?  
 - The policy name is `policygen` by default. The suffix number is generated based on the creation date. This is customizable.
 - The description corresponds to the service and actions selected in [Step 3](#3). You can modify it as needed.

6. Click **Complete** to complete the custom policy creation.
7. Authorize the sub-account as instructed in [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602). After authorization, the sub-account will be granted the needed permission, and the error will be rectified.
