## Creating Meeting

| ------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Schedule a Meeting | You need to enter the meeting information. The scheduled meeting will be retained for 30 days, during which you can join the meeting at any time. |
| Start a meeting    | You don't need to enter the meeting information. The meeting will be retained for only one hour, after which the system will end the meeting if there are no attendees in it. |
