# Share PC Audio During Screen Sharing  

## Feature Overview

In addition to sharing your current screen, the screen sharing feature also supports sharing the audio from your PC with other attendees.

## Prerequisites

- Free, Pro, or Enterprise Edition user

- Windows/macOS

- v2.2.0 or later

- System requirements

**Windows/macOS**

1. Windows 7 or later

2. macOS 10.11 or later

## Notes

1. The principle that "only one user can share only one screen part at any time during a meeting" also applies to sharing PC audio only as it is also a form of "shared content".

2. When you share PC audio only, you cannot enable annotation, and the toolbar will not be collapsed to the top.

3. During screen sharing, you don't have to enable the mic, but you can also choose to enable **Share PC audio**.

4. When sharing PC audio, please check whether the volume level on your PC is 0, and if so, other attendees will not hear your shared audio.

2. If you only want to share the audio from your PC, please select **Only PC audio** .
