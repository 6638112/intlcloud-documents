## Notes

1. The principle that "only one user can share only one screen part at any time during a meeting" also applies to sharing PC audio only as it is also a form of "shared content";

2. When you share PC audio only, you cannot enable annotation, and the toolbar will not be collapsed to the top;

3. During screen sharing, you don't have to enable the mic, but you can also choose to enable **Share PC audio at the same time**;

4. When sharing PC audio, please check whether the volume level on your PC is 0, and if so, other attendees will not hear your shared audio.
