## Overview

When sharing PowerPoint slides, many users often use the **Speaker View** mode to locally display the **Speaker View**. This document describes how to enable the speaker view when sharing the screen in VooV Meeting.

## Notes

1. Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2016 is used below as an example. When you use only one monitor and enter the **Presenter View**, the two windows **Slide Show** and **Presenter View** will appear. At this time, you can use VooV Meeting to share the **Slide Show** and browse the **Speaker View** locally as desired.

2. When selecting the content to be shared, be sure to double check the name of each window.

3. Open the PowerPoint file, enter the "Presenter View" mode, and then share the screen in sequence.
