# Share Screen 

## Feature Overview

The screen sharing feature of VooV Meeting enables you to selectively share the content you are watching with other attendees.

## Prerequisites

- You are a Free, Pro, or Enterprise Edition user

- Windows/macOS/iOS/Android

- v2.2.0 or above

- System requirements

### Windows/macOS

1. Windows 7 or above;

2. macOS 10.11 or above.

### Android/iOS

1. Android 9.0 or above;

2. iOS 12 or above (except iOS 13.0).

## Notes

### Before sharing the screen

1. Before you use a macOS, Android, or iOS device for screen sharing for the first time, your device's screen recording permission is required. This is not required for Windows devices, as the screen recording permission is enabled by default.

2. Before sharing the screen, please first check whether you have screen sharing permission, and if not, request it from the host promptly.

### During screen sharing

1. Currently, VooV Meeting allows only one user to share only one screen part at any time during a meeting.

- A window, desktop, whiteboard, or PC audio can be shared.

2. When you choose to share a certain window, only your operations performed in it will be shared, but not operations performed in other windows;

3. If you use the VooV Meeting for screen sharing on the mobile, the content you are watching on your mobile device (excluding the main window) will be shared;

4. If you share your screen without enabling **Video fluency preferred**, a resolution of up to 1080p and a frame rate of up to 15 fps are supported, and they will be dynamically adjusted according to the resolution set for your screen and the hardware performance;

- For example, if you set the resolution to 1366x768, the resolution of the shared screen will also be 1366x768.

5. When you share a certain window on computer, you need to keep the window open. If the window is minimized to the taskbar or is being dragged, screen sharing will pause; if you directly close the window, screen sharing will end.

## Enable Screen Sharing

### Windows/macOS

1. In a meeting, click **Share Screen** on the toolbar, select the content to be shared, and click **Share** to enable screen sharing;

2. After screen sharing is enabled successfully, the main window will be closed, the toolbar at the bottom will be collapsed to the top of the screen (it will enter immersive mode after 3 seconds and can be called by placing the cursor at the top of the desktop), and the user list in the main window will be moved to the right side of the screen (only your own screen will be displayed by default).
