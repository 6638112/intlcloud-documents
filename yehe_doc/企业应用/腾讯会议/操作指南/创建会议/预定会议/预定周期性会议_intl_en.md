## Feature Overview
The recurring meeting feature can schedule meetings automatically as configured to eliminate your need to schedule meetings one by one.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user.
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.
- **Version:** v1.7.0 or later.

## Notes
- After a recurring meeting is scheduled, you can view all meetings under it and view, modify, and cancel individual meetings.
- All meetings under a recurring meeting share the same meeting ID. To improve security, we recommend you use a waiting room to filter attendees before a meeting starts.
- Similar to the password of a scheduled meeting, the password of a recurring meeting can also be canceled or changed.
- You can select the end time of a recurring meeting and set up to 200 meetings under it.
- The files of individual meetings under a recurring meeting can be aggregated to the entire recurring meeting.
- Legacy versions don't support scheduling recurring meetings but can display them in the same way as in the recurring meeting main window.
- For a meeting minutes template file during recurring meeting scheduling:
 - If it is edited, it won't be deleted, and a new one will be created automatically for use in the next meeting.
 - If it isn't edited, it will be deleted, and a new one will be created automatically for use in the next meeting.
- Attendees of recurring meeting and users who favorite it can delete it from the meeting list, which won't affect it.
