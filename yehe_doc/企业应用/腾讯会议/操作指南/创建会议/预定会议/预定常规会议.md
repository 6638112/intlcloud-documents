## Feature Overview
You can schedule a meeting on web and the client.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user.
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.


## Notes
- The start time of a scheduled meeting cannot be earlier than the current time, but there is no limit on the number of days before the schedule meeting starts.
- You cannot create a meeting if you haven't logged in.
- You can help another user schedule a meeting and transfer the host role after entering the meeting.
- If you are an Enterprise Edition user and are scheduling a meeting, you can invite your enterprise contacts to join the meeting, and the corresponding meeting name will be displayed in the meeting list on the VooV Meeting client of the invitees.
- To batch schedule meetings at different times, select the target times and submit the meeting information.
- After a meeting is scheduled successfully, the meeting ID will be retained for 30 days from the scheduled start time, within which you can return to the meeting at any time.
- If you use a Free Edition account to schedule a meeting, you can hold only one meeting at any time. If there is another meeting in the specified time period, you can select another meeting time or purchase an Enterprise Edition account.
- If you use an Enterprise Edition account to schedule a meeting and the number of scheduled meetings in the specified time period has reached the upper limit of concurrent meetings, your scheduled meeting may not be held normally. In this case, you can select another meeting time or increase the number of concurrent meetings under your Enterprise Edition account.
