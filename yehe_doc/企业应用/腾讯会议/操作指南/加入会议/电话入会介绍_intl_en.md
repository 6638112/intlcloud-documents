## Feature Overview
VooV Meeting allows you to join a meeting on phone without installing the client.


## Prerequisites
- A functional landline or mobile phone 
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user

## Notes
- In "Call In" mode, you can use a landline or mobile phone to dial the corresponding number instead of using the VooV Meeting client to join a meeting, which has a more stable call audio quality. However, in this connection method, your carrier will charge you for the local or international call according to applicable billing rules.
- After you enter the attendee ID, the landline or mobile phone rather than the PC mic and speaker will be used as the meeting audio source, which has a more stable call audio quality. If you don't enter the attendee ID but directly press **#** to join the meeting, you will enter the meeting as an independent attendee. In the scenario in this document, you don't need to enter the attendee ID and can directly enter **#** to join the meeting.


## How to Use
### On landline phone

1. Call in and enter the meeting ID as prompted to join the meeting.
2. Dial by your location: you can find the applicable dial-in number at [VooV Meeting International Dial-in Numbers](https://voovmeeting.com/df/zh-CN/container.html?page=compliance%C2%AEion=df&lang=zh-CN&src=%2Fmobile%2Fdf%2Fzh-CN%2Fpstn.html).
3. Enter the meeting ID and press **#** for confirmation.

5. If **You have joined the meeting, and x attendees are in the meeting currently** is prompted, you have joined the meeting successfully.
- **Note:** if you already have a device in the meeting but want to use a landline or mobile phone as the audio source, you can configure as instructed in [Audio Selection and Testing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1054/44929).
