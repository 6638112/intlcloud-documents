## Feature Overview
You can join a meeting on the mobile or PC client.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android

## Notes
- Up to 10 meetings can be displayed in the **Meeting ID** drop-down list in the **Join Meeting** window.
- After you join a meeting, the system will prompt you to select an audio connection method from the following:
 - Call Me (supported for Enterprise Edition only): VooV Meeting will actively call your meeting room phone number or your personal landline or mobile number. We recommend you use this audio connection method in a meeting room or large meeting to enjoy a better audio experience.
 - Call In: you can use a landline or mobile phone to dial the corresponding number to join the meeting, and the phone rather than the PC mic and speaker will be used as your meeting audio source, which has a better call audio quality.
 - PC Audio: you can directly use the PC mic and speaker (headset) as the meeting audio connection method to join the meeting, which is suitable for small meetings and is not limited by scenarios.
 - If you don't select an audio connection method, you cannot speak or hear other attendees during the meeting.
