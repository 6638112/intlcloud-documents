## How to Use
### PC audio
In "PC Audio" mode, you can directly use the PC mic and speaker (headset) as the meeting audio connection method to join the meeting, which is suitable for small meetings and is not limited by scenarios. If you want to hold a large meeting, we recommend you use "Call In" as the audio connection method, which has a better audio quality.
- After entering a meeting, select **PC Audio** or **Call In** in the **Select a Method to Connect to Meeting Audio** pop-up window.
- You can also click the arrow on the right of **Mute/Unmute** in the bottom bar of the meeting window and select **PC Audio**.
- You can also select **Use PC Audio by Default** on the **PC Audio** tab in the **Select a Method to Connect to Meeting Audio** pop-up window, so that you don't need to select the audio connection method again when joining a meeting next time, and PC audio will be used by default.

### Call in
In "Call In" mode, you can use a landline or mobile phone to dial the corresponding number to join a meeting, and the phone rather than the PC mic and speaker will be used as your meeting audio source, which has a more stable call audio quality. However, in this connection method, your carrier will charge you for the local or international call according to applicable billing rules.
- After you enter a meeting, the **Select a Method to Connect to Meeting Audio** window will pop up.
- Click **Call In** in the pop-up window.
- Select your country/region.
- After selection, dial the number displayed on the page by using your landline or mobile phone.
- After the call is connected, enter the meeting ID and press **#** for confirmation as prompted.
- Enter your attendee ID and press **#** for confirmation.
- If **You have joined the meeting, and x attendees are in the meeting currently** is prompted, you have joined the meeting successfully.

>
- If you use a mobile phone to dial the number, you can press and hold **0** to enter the **+** sign; on a VoIP phone, press and hold " " to enter **+**; on a general landline phone, enter **0086** to indicate the **+86** code. Then, enter the attendee ID and press **#** for confirmation as prompted.
- After you enter the attendee ID, the landline or mobile phone rather than the PC mic and speaker will be used as the meeting audio source, which has a more stable call audio quality. If you don't enter the attendee ID but directly press **#** to join the meeting, you will enter the meeting as an independent attendee, and howling may occur on the phone and your original device in the meeting.
