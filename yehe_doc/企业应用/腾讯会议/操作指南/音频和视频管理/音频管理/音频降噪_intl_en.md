## Feature Overview

VooV Meeting supports audio noise cancellation. After it is enabled, other attendees can hear your voice more clearly even in a noisy environment.

## Prerequisites
- **Camera:** built-in or external camera
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user
- **Logged-in device:**
  - Windows 7 or later
  - macOS 10.11 or later
  - Android 4.4 or later with support for OpenCL or NEON
  - iOS 10 or later

## Notes
The music mode conflicts with audio noise cancellation, and only one of them can be enabled at the same time. On the PC client, if the music mode is enabled, the level of audio noise cancellation can only be **Close** or **Low**.

## How to Use
### On PC client
1. Open VooV Meeting and join a meeting.
2. Click **Settings** on the toolbar during the meeting.
3. Click **Audio** on the settings page.
4. On the **Audio** page, find **Audio Noise Cancellation** and select a level (Close, Low, Medium, or High) in the drop-down list. The higher the level, the stronger the noise cancellation effect. If you want to capture non-human sounds in the environment, we recommend you set a relatively low level.

### On mobile client
1. Open VooV Meeting and join a meeting.
2. Tap **More** > **Settings** on the toolbar during the meeting.
3. Scroll down the settings page and toggle on **Audio Noise Cancellation**.
