### Muting and Unmuting Attendees
Hosts are allowed to mute or unmute attendees during the meeting. We recommend muting all attendees to reduce background noise. 
1. If the meeting organizer selected the "Mute All" option, all attendees will be muted by default until the meeting organizer turns this option off. We suggest enabling **Allow Attendees to Unmute Themselves** when you **Mute All**.

2. Hosts can unmute any attendee with their consent during online meetings. 

## Renaming Attendees
**Role:** Organizer/Co-Host/Attendee
### Renaming Attendees
We suggest changing your alias before joining the meeting. This will help attendees recognize each other. This especially applies to large-scale conferences with attendees from multiple organizations. 

1. Select an attendee from the list to change their display name. 

2. Click **Rename** to update their name.

3. Only the meeting organizer and co-host can rename others. Attendees can only rename themselves.
