### Muting and Unmuting Attendees

Hosts can mute or unmute attendees during the meeting. We recommend muting all attendees to reduce background noise.

1. If the meeting organizer selected the "Mute All" option, all attendees will be muted by default until the meeting organizer turns this option off. We suggest enabling **Allow Attendees to Unmute Themselves** when you **Mute All**.

2. Hosts can unmute any attendee with their consent during online meetings.

## Renaming Attendees
**Role:** Organizer/Co-Host/Attendee
### Renaming Attendees
We suggest changing your alias before joining the meeting. This will help attendees recognize each other. This especially applies to large-scale conferences with attendees from multiple organizations.

Both the host and co-host can rename attendees. 

1. Host/Co-host can select an attendee from the list to change their display name. 
2. Attendees can tap on their own names to **Rename** themselves.
