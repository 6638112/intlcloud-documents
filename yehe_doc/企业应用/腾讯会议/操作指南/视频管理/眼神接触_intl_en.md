## Overview
The gaze correction feature can correct the gaze, so that your gaze can remain focused in the video image even when you are not looking at the camera.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise edition user
- **Logged-in device:** Windows or macOS
- **Version:** v2.4.0 or later
- **Hardware requirements:** currently, this feature is supported only on models with a CPU of Intel Core i5 4-core or later.

## Notes
- Before using gaze correction, you can check whether your PC supports this feature in **Settings** > **Video**. If **Gaze Correction** is grayed out, it indicates that the feature is not supported.
- Gaze correction can take effect when the positive/negative offset of your face is within ±30° in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes.
- If there are multiple users in front of the camera, gaze correction will take effect only for the user whose head occupies the largest proportion of the image.
- After gaze correction is enabled, all attendees can view its effect.
