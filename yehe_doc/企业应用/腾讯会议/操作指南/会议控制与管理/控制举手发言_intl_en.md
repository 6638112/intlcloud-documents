## Feature Overview
When the host mutes all attendees, if an attendee raises hand, the host can control and manage the attendee's behaviors.

## Prerequisites
- **Logged-in user:** Free or Enterprise Edition user.
- **Logged-in device:** Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android.

## Notes
- The current VooV Meeting version cannot record the name of the hand raiser and the number of hand raises.
- VooV Meeting currently does not support adding text for hand raise.

## Controlling Hand Raise
1. If the host enables **Mute All** and **Attendees Cannot Unmute Themselves**, when you click **Unmute**, you will raise hand to apply to the host for unmuting.
2. When receiving the application, the host can click **Attendees** or click **Raise Hand** above **Attendees** to control your hand raise.
3. If the host accepts your application, you are unmuted. If the host rejects your application or clicks **Lower Hand**, you need to raise hand again to unmute yourself.
