# Waiting Room

## Feature Overview

The waiting room can be used to keeping order when joining meeting and guarantee meeting security. After the waiting room is enabled, all attendees require consent from the host or co-host before they can join the meeting, thus eliminating the concerns over the leakage of meeting ID and improving the meeting efficiency.
