## Prerequisites

## Notes

1. Currently, this feature supports syncing the following types of meetings:

- Meeting Status: upcoming/in progress;

- Meeting Type: scheduled public meetings, private meetings, and recurring meetings;

2. The permission to read your calendar is required when you sync meetings for the first time, so you need to grant the access to your system calendar;

3. Once enabled, meetings containing meeting links added to the system calendar in the last three months will be verified and synced;

4. If a password-protected meeting is added, you need to enter the password first before you can join the meeting and view the documents uploaded during the meeting on the details page. If a private meeting is added, you need to verify your identity first before you can join the meeting.
