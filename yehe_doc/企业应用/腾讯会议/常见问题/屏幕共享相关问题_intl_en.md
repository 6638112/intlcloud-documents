## When I try to start screen sharing on macOS 10.15, the system prompts an error of no permission to record. What should I do?
Starting from macOS 10.15, some users may experience an issue with the sharing permission compatibility. It can be fixed in the following steps:
1. Go to **System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy**.
2. Deselect the option. If you are using VooV Meeting, you will be asked whether to exit. Click **Later**, and then select the option again. If you are using VooV Meeting, you will be asked whether to exit again. Then, click **Later** and check whether the screen can be shared.
3. If the problem persists, try restarting the computer.
4. If the problem still persists, right-click and select **Show in Finder**, delete the VooV Meeting app, and check whether the app is still displayed in the list.
 - If yes, continue to delete until an unselected VooV Meeting app appears in the list, and then select it.
 - If no unselected VooV Meeting app appears in the list after deletion, you can reinstall VooV meeting to fix the problem.


## What should I do if the screen turns black or gray during screen sharing?
There are several causes of this problem:
#### Black screen caused by pause, with small words displayed in the center of the screen
Solution: the problem will be fixed when the sharer clicks **Resume Share** or maximizes the shared window. Check whether "xxx paused share" is displayed on the black screen as shown below:

If so, check whether the following is displayed on the topbar:

- "xxx has paused screenshare"
- "Share paused. Bring your shared window to the front."
 - If the sharer's topbar displays "xxx has paused screenshare" as shown below, check whether the sharer clicked **Pause**.

 - If the sharer's topbar displays "Share paused. Bring your shared window to the front." as shown below, check whether the sharer minimized the shared window.


#### Partial or full black/gray screen caused by window occlusion
Solution: the problem will be fixed when the sharer removes the occlusion of the shared window.
Check whether the shared window is occluded by another window. For some device models (for example, Windows 7 PC), the occluded part of the window will be displayed as a black or gray screen on the viewer's end as shown below.

At this time, the sharer's topbar will display "Window obscured. Bring your shared window to the front." as shown below. This helps determine whether the problem is caused by window occlusion, and if this is the case, the problem can be fixed when the sharer removes the occlusion of the shared window.


#### Black/Gray screen caused by other issues
If the problem is caused by other issues, contact [Online Support] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/support) for assistance.
