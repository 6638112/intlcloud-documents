In unstable or poor networks or even with no network, Ecard can still provide QR code services normally to ensure business continuity.

 

## High security and reliability

By prohibiting screencapturing and screen recording and leveraging dynamic encryption, Ecard guarantees trustworthy identities, prevents security incidents like electronic card loss, lending, and tampering, and protects the security of user data and properties.
