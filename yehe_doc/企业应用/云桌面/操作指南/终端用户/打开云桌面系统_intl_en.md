>?In order to have a better CVD access experience, we recommend you use the client access mode.

[](id:Client)
### Client access

Launch the client to open CVD. This method provides the best immersive graphics experience.
>! Make sure that the client has been installed. If the client prompts you to set up an account or enter a user ID, just close it.

1. Download the CVD client and install it. If the client has already been installed on your computer, skip this step.
2. Make sure that the client has been installed, and then click **Client access** again. The CVD portal will automatically launch the client plugin to open the CVD instance.
>?If you click **Download client** but nothing happens, it is because your browser blocks pop-ups. You will receive a message from your browser stating that pop-ups have been blocked. Whether pop-ups are allowed depends on the browser settings.

**Note: Citrix Workspace is a lightweight client that enhances the CVD access experience and delivers the best graphics effect.**

[](id:Browser)
### Browser access

Browser access is to quickly open and use a CVD instance based on the browser's HTML5 capability, with no need to download and install the client. However, there are some restrictions in this mode; for example, you can upload local files of only up to 2 GB to CVD and download CVD files of only up to 250 MB to your local device at a time, and you cannot map some device drivers.

>! The quick access mode requires your browser to support HTML5.

1. Select the CVD instance you want to access.
2. Click **Browser access**, and a browser tab will pop up automatically to open the CVD instance. Then, you can access CVD resources.
>?If you cannot access CVD from your browser, check your local network connection and make sure that your browser supports HTML5. If the problem persists, it may be because the browser has blocked pop-ups. If this is the case, allow pop-ups and try again.
