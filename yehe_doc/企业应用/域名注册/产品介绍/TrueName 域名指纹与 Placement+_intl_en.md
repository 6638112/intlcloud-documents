## TrueName Overview

TrueName is a brand interest protection service provided by the Donuts registry. This service is automatically activated for domain suffixes purchased from Donuts without the need for manual operations. The validity period of TrueName service is the same as that of the domain name. After you successfully purchase a domain name with the <span ><img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/44903522c47c1469c82a0eb9683488e7.png" style="margin-bottom:-7px;"/></span> icon, Donuts will forbid others to register homograph domain names to protect the brand interests of the domain owner and block phishing attacks.

>? **Homograph**: also known as confusable character. For example, you replace a letter or digit with a Latin, Greek or Cyrillic character. For related samples, see [here](https://www.unicode.org/Public/security/8.0.0/confusables.txt).

Assume that you have registered the <span ><img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/fec805395995285c271da8d5c079ca17.png" style="margin-bottom:-7px;"/></span> domain name with TrueName protection. Someone is trying to register the `tencent.com` domain name, which basically looks the same as your domain name to the naked eye. However, the <span ><img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/96619d2b4eb6425dc7d29db15131636b.png" style="margin-bottom:-3px;"/></span> character in the `tencent.com` domain name is considered as a homograph of the letter `e`, so this domain name is blocked by Donuts and cannot be registered.
