## FAQs
### Why should I verify the mobile number/email address?
As required by security compliance and ICANN policies and in order to enhance domain identity verification, only a verified mobile number/email address can be used for domain identity verification to ensure contact information correctness.

### What should I do if "Only a verified mobile number/email address is supported" is prompted?
If you see this system prompt during domain registration in the Domains console, it indicates that the mobile number or email address entered in the information of the current domain has not been verified. In this case, you cannot proceed to subsequent steps.
You need to modify the relevant domain information and information template by changing the mobile number/email address to verified ones. You can also create a new information template with a verified mobile number/email address. Then, you can proceed to subsequent steps.


### How do I verify the information?
Go to the [Phone and Email Verification](link) page, create a mobile number/email address, and verify them. After verification, you can select and use them in the domain information, identity verification, and information template.

### Can I skip verifying the mobile number/email address?
No. Unverified mobile numbers/email addresses cannot be used in domain information, identity verification, and information template. To use them, you must create and verify them on the [Phone and Email Verification](link) page first. In one single information template, both the mobile number and email address must be verified.

### What is the impact on domains that already passed identity verification?
Domains that already passed identity verification can be used normally with no impact, but if you want to modify the domain information, you must select a verified mobile number/email address as the contact information.

### Can I continue using an information template that already passed identity verification?
No. No matter what status it is in, an existing information template cannot continue to be used if it contains an unverified mobile number or email address. Such templates cannot be directly associated with domains or used in information modification. To use them, you must verify the mobile number/email address first. You can also create a new information template with a verified mobile number/email address.


### Do I need to verify the mobile number/email address in an existing information template again?
The mobile number and email address in an existing information template don't need to be verified again; however, a template can be used only after the mobile number and email address are changed to verified ones. During the change, you only need to verify the new mobile number and email address but not the old ones.
