## Eliminating ISP Local DNS Exceptions
HTTPDNS replaces the default DNS method of mobile and desktop applications with the HTTP protocol, avoiding network access exceptions caused by the ISP's local DNS service errors.
It is mainly used in the development of the following types of mobile applications:
- **News and game applications**
Applications that require a shorter access delay and less cross-network access and focus on fast response. Such applications connected to the service include Tencent Games and Autohome.
- **Ecommerce applications**
Applications that require a lower connection failure rate and higher business efficiency and focus on the access request stability. Such applications connected to the service include Jumei and Ele.me.
- **Social networking applications**
Applications with domains frequently hijacked that require smooth user access. Such applications connected to the service include Mobile QQ.
- **Audio/Video applications**
Applications that demand a higher smoothness and connection success rate for music and video playback. Such applications connected to the service include Bilibili and QQ Music.

## Lowering DNS Latency and Hijacking Risk
**Currently, HTTPDNS has covered more than 400 million users, and businesses connected to it see an over 60% reduction in user access failures caused by domain name hijacking and a 22% reduction in access delay on average.**
- After connection to HTTPDNS, Tencent Games sees a reduction of 13% in the DNS latency with much fewer cross-network access requests.
- After connection to HTTPDNS, Tencent News sees a drop of 22% in the user connection failure rate and a higher business success rate.
- After connection to HTTPDNS, QQ Music sees a drop of 13% in the overall user access latency.
- After connection to HTTPDNS, Mobile QQ sees a reduction of 99% in failures caused by domain hijacking.
