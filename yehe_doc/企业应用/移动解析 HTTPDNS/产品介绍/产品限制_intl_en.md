## HTTPDNS API Request Rate Limit
For a single user of HTTPDNS, there is no limit on the API request rate by default (for Enterprise Edition only).
- For Enterprise Edition users, there is no limit on the API request rate by default.
- For free trial users, the request limit is 100 QPS per IP and 1,000 QPS per domain. After the limit is exceeded, packet loss or response failure/delay will occur. We recommend you use Enterprise Edition for your business to avoid being affected by the rate limit.
