### Security and Reliability
- Private DNS is a Tencent Cloud strategic product based on DNSPod's 14 years of DNS technology accumulation and provides more professional private domain name DNS capabilities.
- It provides Tencent Cloud VPC-dedicated private network DNS to directly respond to VPC domain name DNS requests, which is fast, efficient, and effective in preventing hijacking.



### Wide Applicability
The core network infrastructure component of Private DNS in VPC scenarios helps you easily deploy integrated VPC solutions.


### Ease of Use
You can customize IP mappings for private domain names and quickly tag them for easier OPS management.

### Flexibility and Elasticity
You can create custom public networks and register private domain names that comply with the IANA specifications, which makes the configuration of private domain names more flexible and elastic.


### Unified Management
One private domain name can be associated with multiple VPCs to facilitate unified management and deployment.


### Comprehensive Records
6 types of records are supported: A, CNAME, MX, AAAA, TXT, and PTR, covering multiple application scenarios of DNS.


### Reverse DNS
You can set reverse DNS by creating a fixed private domain ending with `in-addr.arpa` and adding a PTR record.

### Subdomain Recursive DNS
After subdomain recursive DNS is enabled, subdomains that have no DNS records configured will be automatically forwarded to the public authoritative DNS for resolution.
