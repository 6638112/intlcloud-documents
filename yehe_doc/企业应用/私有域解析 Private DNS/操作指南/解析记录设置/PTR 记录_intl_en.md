## Overview
This document describes how to add a PTR record, through which you can reversely resolve a private IP address to the corresponding private network domain name.

 - **Host**: the combination of the host and the created domain name (without `in-addr.arpa`) is in the fixed IPv4 format, and you can enter only an integer between 0 and 255 for each IP range.
 - **Record Type**: only **PTR** is supported.
 - **Record Value**: enter the private domain name corresponding to the private IP address.
 - **TTL**: it is the cache time and 300s by default. The smaller the value, the faster the change to the record will take effect. You can enter an integer between 1 and 86400.
4. Click **Save**.
