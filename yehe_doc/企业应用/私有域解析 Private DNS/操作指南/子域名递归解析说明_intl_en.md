## Overview
Private DNS supports subdomain recursive DNS. When a client initiates a DNS request, if the corresponding subdomain DNS record is not configured for the private domain, Private DNS will return the corresponding record according to whether this feature is enabled.
- If subdomain recursive DNS is not enabled, the SOA record will be returned.
- If subdomain recursive DNS is enabled, the public DNS record will be returned.

For example, the private domain `dnspod.cn` has the following three private records:

| Host | Record Type | Record Value | TTL |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| 01 | A |1.1.1.1 | 600 |
| 02 | A |1.1.1.2 | 600 |
| 03 | A |1.1.1.3 | 600 |

- When you initiate DNS requests for `01.dnspod.cn`, `02.dnspod.cn`, and `03.dnspod.cn`, private records `1.1.1.1`, `1.1.1.2`, and `1.1.1.3` will be returned, respectively.
- When you initiate DNS requests for public domain names such as `www.dnspod.cn`, `bbs.dnspod.cn`, and `rss.dnspod.cn`, recursive queries will be performed, and public DNS results of the actual internet domain names will be used as the final DNS response results.
