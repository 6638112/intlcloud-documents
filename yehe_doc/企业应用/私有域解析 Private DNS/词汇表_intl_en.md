### Private DNS
Private DNS is a DNS system based on Tencent Cloud's Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) environment.

### Private Domain
It is short for "private domain name" and specifically differentiates from the access on the common public network, that is, it needs to be performed at domain name registrars.

### CNAME Record
A CNAME record points an alias name to an A record, so that there is no need to create an A record for the name.


### PTR Record
A pointer (PTR) record, aka reverse DNS record, is the reverse record of an A record and is responsible for the reverse resolution of an IP to a domain name.


### Request Volume Statistics
Request volume statistics refers to the statistical display of the volume of requests generated by private domains managed by the current account. You can filter resources by time, VPC, private domain, and region to view their usage statistics.

### Subdomain Recursive DNS
Subdomain recursive DNS refers to the recursion to the public network for DNS queries in case that the corresponding DNS record is not set for the private domain.

### Associated VPC
VPC is a dedicated cloud network space built by Tencent Cloud, which can easily manage and configure the internal networks and make secure and fast network changes. VPC association refers to the association between the private domains created in Private DNS and the dedicated cloud network spaces built by Tencent Cloud.
