- **Purchasing a certificate**: on the Tencent Cloud [SSL Certificate Service purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/ssl?fromSource=ssl) or [SSL Certificate Service console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ssl), select your desired certificate type, brand, and domain name type. For more information, see [Purchase Procedure](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30159).
- **Submitting information for verification**:
  - Domain name ownership verification: enter the information of your certificate. After submitting the information, three verification methods are supported: automatic DNS verification, manual DNS verification, and file verification. For more information, see [Domain Verification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30168).
  - Organization verification: for paid OV and EV SSL certificates, you need to submit the information, upload the confirmation letter, and wait for review. A reviewer will call you to verify the information and send an email asking you to confirm the domain name information. For more information, see [Material Submission for OV/EV SSL Certificates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30160).
- **Issuing a certificate**: after your certificate application is approved, the CA will issue a certificate to you.
- **Installing a certificate**: download and decompress the certificate from the SSL Certificate Service console, and install it on your server. For more information, see [Certificate Installation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1007/30173).
