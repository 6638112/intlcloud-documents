### Why does the order status not changed after a notification email is received from a CA?

During material review and certificate issuance, the CA may send an email to notify you of the progress of the certificate application. If the order status does not change in the SSL Certificate Service Console of Tencent Cloud after you receive the email, the cause is that there is a delay in pushing the order status to Tencent Cloud by the CA. It is recommended that you wait for a while.
