>- Private domains with the same name cannot be associated with the same VPC. If existing VPCs cannot meet your needs, you can modify them in the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc).
>- Even if you delete related VPC resources in the VPC console, you still need to manually disassociate them in the Private DNS console.
>
4. Click **Save** to complete the modification.
