 - **Host**: enter a subdomain. For example, when adding a record for `www.dnspod.cn`, you can simply select **www** in the **Host** field. If you want to add a record for `dnspod.cn`, select **@** in the **Host** field.
 - **Record Type**: select **AAAA**.
 - **Record Value**: you can only enter an IPv6 address, such as `ff06:0:0:0:0:0:0:c3`.
 - **Weight**: it refers to configuring multiple record values for the same host on the DNS server. In this way, when the server responds to DNS queries, all record values will return different DNS results according to the preset weights and distribute the resolved traffic to different servers, so as to implement load balancing. The weight value can be an integer between 1 and 100.
 - **MX Priority**: leave it empty.
 - **TTL**: it is the cache time and 300s by default. The smaller the value, the faster the change to the record will take effect. You can enter an integer between 1 and 86400.
4. Click **Save**.
