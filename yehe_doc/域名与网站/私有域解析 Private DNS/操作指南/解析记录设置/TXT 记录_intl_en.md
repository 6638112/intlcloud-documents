 - **Host**: enter a subdomain. For example, when adding a TXT record for `www.dnspod.cn`, you can simply select **www** in the **Host** field. If you want to add a TXT record for `dnspod.cn`, select **@** in the **Host** field.
 - **Record Type**: select **TXT**.
 - **Record Value**: there is no fixed format.
 - **MX Priority**: leave it empty.
 - **TTL**: it is the cache time and 300s by default. The smaller the value, the faster the change to the record will take effect. You can enter an integer between 1 and 86400.
4. Click **Save**.
