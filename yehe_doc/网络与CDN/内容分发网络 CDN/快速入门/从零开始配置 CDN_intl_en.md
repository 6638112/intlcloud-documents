### Verifying your identity

You can complete identity verification in the [CDN console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn). For more information, see [Identity Verification Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Directions

### Activating CDN

CDN supports two service regions, namely, **Chinese mainland** and **Outside Chinese mainland**. Currently, it can be billed only **by traffic hourly**. For more information on billing rules, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/2949).

Indicate your consent to the Terms of Service, click **Activate CDN**, and start using the acceleration service.


>! ECDN is a product specially optimized by Tencent Cloud based on CDN for dynamic business acceleration scenarios. You can directly use it in the CDN console. For more information on ECDN, see [Enterprise Content Delivery Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/570).



## Subsequent Steps

### Adding domain name

After activating CDN, you should add your business domain names to be accelerated to CDN, so your users' access to it can be accelerated. For more information, see [Adding Domain Names](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/5734).

### Configure CNAME
After connecting your domain name to CDN, you need to configure the CNAME with your domain name provider. The CDN service will be available after the configuration takes effect. For more information, see [Configuring CNAME](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/3121).
