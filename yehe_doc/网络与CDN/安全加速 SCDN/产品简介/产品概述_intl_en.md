## What Is SCDN?

Based on fast and stable content delivery network services, Tencent Cloud Secure Content Delivery Network (SCDN) provides protection capabilities against various cyber attacks. For [Content Delivery Network (CDN)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/products/cdn) or [Enterprise Content Delivery Network (ECDN)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/ecdn) domain names, you can easily enable SCDN to protect your business against DDoS attacks, CC attacks, web attacks, and bots.

>- SCDN provides security services based on two basic products: **CDN** and **ECDN**. Its service regions are divided into **Chinese mainland** and **Outside Chinese mainland**.

The following problems can be effectively addressed:

1. Large volumes of DDoS attacks and CC attacks may overwhelm the CDN/SCDN bandwidth, causing extensive traffic and requests not from your business and extra costs.
2. CDN/ECDN services provide limited protection and access control capabilities, such as IP access limit and access authentication. Given increasingly complex cyber threats and attacks, they can deliver an all-out protection by combining with other cloud security products, separate service configurations, and additional network transport layers.

You can easily enable SCDN without making changes to existing CDN/SCDN and DNS settings and customize your SCDN settings as needed.
