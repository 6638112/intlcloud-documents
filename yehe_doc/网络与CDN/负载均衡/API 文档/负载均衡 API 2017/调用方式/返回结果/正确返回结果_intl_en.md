>? **This is a legacy API and may be deprecated in the future. It is currently not displayed on the left sidebar. We recommend using <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/33789" target="_blank">CLB API 3.0</a>, which is more standardized and has a significantly reduced access latency.**

If an API call succeeds, the `code` field in the final returned result will be 0. The `message` field will be empty, and the returned result data will be displayed.

Below is a sample response:
```
{
    "code": "0",
    "message": ""
    <Response data>
}
```
