>? **This is a legacy API and may be deprecated in the future. We recommend using <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/33789" target="_blank">CLB API 3.0</a>. The updated version is more standardized with significantly reduced access latency.**

## Features

The `code` (error code) in the response body indicates the result of the call to a TencentCloud API. It is a common error code applicable to all APIs. If `code` is 0, the call succeeded; otherwise, the call failed, and you can determine the cause of the error and take corresponding actions based on the list of common error codes.
Sample:

```
{
    "code": "5100"
}
```
