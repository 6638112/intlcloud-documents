SNAT is not performed for any VPC-based private network CLB instances (i.e., instances configured with VPC when creating) purchased after December 15, 2016, which means the access IP obtained from the server is the real client IP. To ensure normal operations of your business, please note:
1. For private network CLB instances purchased after December 15, 2016, after a security group policy is enabled, you must allow the inbound rules of all client IPs to ensure normal access.
2. For the private network CLB instances purchased before December 15, 2016, if you want to convert them to non-SNAT type, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance. After the conversion is made, the access IP obtained from the server will be the client IP, and the business will not be interrupted during the conversion.
