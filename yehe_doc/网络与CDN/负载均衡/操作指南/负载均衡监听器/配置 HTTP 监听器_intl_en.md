You can create an HTTP listener to a CLB instance to forward HTTP requests from the client. HTTP is suitable for applications where request contents need to be identified, such as web applications and mobile apps.

## Prerequisites
You need to create a CLB instance as instructed in [Creating CLB Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149) first.

## Directions
### Step 1. Configure a listener
1. Log in to the [CLB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb) and click **Instance Management** on the left sidebar.
2. Select a region in the top-left corner of the CLB instance list page and click **Configure Listener** in the **Operation** column on the right.

3. Under **HTTP/HTTPS Listener**, click **Create** and configure the HTTP listener in the **Create Listener** pop-up window.

<td>Enable Persistent Connection</td>
<td>Once this feature is enabled, persistent connections will be used between CLB and real server, and CLB will no longer pass through the source IP, which can be obtained from XFF. To ensure normal forwarding, enable the "Allow by default" feature in the CLB security group or allow `100.127.0.0/16` in the CVM security group.
<dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
Once this feature is enabled, the number of the connections between CLB and the backend service will fluctuate in the range of [QPS, QPS*60], subject to the connection reuse rate. If the backend service has a limit on the maximum number of connections, we recommend you be cautious when enabling this feature. This feature is currently in beta test. To try it out, [submit a ticket](https://console.tencentcloud.com/workorder/category).

Scheduling is done based on the <b>number of new connections</b>, where servers with higher weights will undergo more polls (i.e., a higher probability), while servers with the same weight process the same number of connections.</li><li>WLC: loads of servers are estimated according to the number of active connections to the servers. Scheduling is done based on server loads and weights. If their weights are the same, servers with fewer active connections will undergo more polls (i.e., a higher probability).</li><li>IP hash: Hash keys are used to locate the corresponding servers in the static hash table based on the source IPs of requests. If a server is available and not overloaded, requests will be delivered to it; otherwise, a null value will be returned.</li></ul></td>

### Step 2. Bind a backend CVM
1. On the **Listener management** page, select the created listener `HTTP:80`. Click **+** on the left to expand the domain names and URL paths, select the desired URL path, and view the real servers bound to the path on the right of the listener.
2. Click **Bind**, select the target real server, and configure the server port and weight in the pop-up window.
>? Default port: Enter the **Default Port** first and then select the CVM instance. The port of every CVM instance is the default port.
>


### Step 3. Configure a security group (optional)
You can configure a CLB security group to isolate public network traffic. For more information, see [Configuring CLB Security Group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733).

### Step 4. Modify or delete a listener (optional)
If you need to modify or delete a created listener, click the listener on the **Listener Management** page and click ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/4ab10b98316964812832043bbfd99df6.svg) for modification or ![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/e863cc51c29790d665d53feba800fd90.svg) for deletion.
