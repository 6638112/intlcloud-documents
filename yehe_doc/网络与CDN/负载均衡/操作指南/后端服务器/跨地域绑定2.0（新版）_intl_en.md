CLB supports binding CVM instances across regions through CCN, allowing you to select real servers of different regions and bind CLB instances to them across VPCs or regions.
This feature is currently in beta. If you want to use it, please [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/mzjxboiv2yq). 
>?
>- Cross-region CVM binding is currently not supported for classic CLB instances.
>- This feature is available only to bill-by-IP accounts. To check your account type, please see [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).
>- Cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment do not support [Allow Traffic by Default in security groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733), for which you need to allow the client IP and service port on the real server.


## Use Cases
1. The cross-region binding feature can well meet the needs in P2P gaming scenarios where the same server is shared by players from different regions. For example, if your real server cluster is deployed in Guangzhou, you can create CLB instances in Shanghai and Beijing and bind them to the same real server cluster in Guangzhou to achieve game acceleration and traffic convergence, ensuring the data transfer quality and reducing the latency.
2. This feature can ensure the transfer quality and data consistency in key business transactions, meeting the stringent requirements of the financial industry and payment scenarios.

## Prerequisites
1. Submit an application for beta test eligibility. For cross-region binding in the Chinese mainland, please submit a ticket for application. For cross-region binding outside the Chinese mainland, please [contact your Tencent Cloud rep](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).
2. Create a CLB instance. For more information, please see [Creating CLB Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149).
3. Create a CCN instance. For more information, please see [Creating a CCN Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30062).
4. Associate the target VPC with the created CCN instance. For more information, please see [Associating Network Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).


## Operation Directions
1. Log in to the [CLB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/loadbalance).
2. On the **Instance Management** page, click the ID of the target CLB instance.

6. On the instance details page, open the **Listener Management** tab, and bind a real server to the CLB instance in the listener configuration section. For more information, please see [Managing Real Servers](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6156).
7. In the pop-up box, select **Other VPC**, click **CVM**, select one or multiple target CVM instances, enter the forwarding port and weight, and click **Confirm**. For more information on ports, please see [Server Common Port](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12451).

8. Now in the **Bound Real Servers** section, you can view the bound CVM instances of other regions.
