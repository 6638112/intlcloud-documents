CLB supports binding CVM instances across regions through CCN, allowing you to select real servers of different regions and bind CLB instances to them across VPCs or regions.
This feature is currently in beta test. To try it out, please [submit an application](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/mzjxboiv2yq).

>- Cross-region CVM binding is currently not supported for classic CLB instances.

>- Cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment do not support [Allow Traffic by Default in security groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733), for which you need to allow the client IP and service port on the real server.

## Use Cases
1. The cross-region binding feature can well meet the needs in P2P gaming scenarios where the same server is shared by players from different regions. For example, if your real server cluster is deployed in Guangzhou, you can create CLB instances in Shanghai and Beijing and bind them to the same real server cluster in Guangzhou to achieve game acceleration and traffic convergence, ensuring the data transfer quality and reducing the latency.
2. This feature can ensure the transfer quality and data consistency in key business transactions, meeting the stringent requirements of the financial industry and payment scenarios.

## Limits
- Cross-network CVM instance binding is currently not supported for classic CLB instances.
- This feature is available only to bill-by-IP accounts. To check your account type, please see [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).
- This feature is only supported by VPC, not by classic networks.
- This feature is supported on IPv4 and IPv6 NAT64 CLB instances. The IPv6 CLB instance needs to enable the dual-stack mixing binding, which allows the layer-7 listener to bind both IPv4 and IPv6 CVM instances. On this basis, the CLB instance supports cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment.
- Cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment do not support [Allow Traffic by Default in security groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/14733), for which you need to allow the client IP and service port on the real server.
- CLB instances cannot be bound with each other in cross-region binding 2.0 and hybrid cloud deployment scenarios.
- Both layer-4 and layer-7 (HTTP/HTTPS) CLB services support getting a client IP. For layer-4 CLB, the source IP obtained on the backend CVM instance is the client IP. For layer-7 CLB, you can use the X-Forwarded-For or remote_addr field to directly get the client IP. For more information, see [Obtaining Real Client IPs Over IPv4 CLBs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/3728).



## Prerequisites
1. You have submitted the application for beta test eligibility. For cross-region binding in the Chinese mainland, [submit a ticket](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/apply/p/mzjxboiv2yq) for application. For cross-region binding outside the Chinese mainland, [contact your Tencent Cloud rep](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/contact-sales).
2. You have created a CLB instance. For more information, please see [Creating CLB Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6149).
3. You have created a CCN instance. For more information, please see [Creating a CCN Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30062).
4. Associate the target VPC with the created CCN instance. For more information, please see [Associating Network Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).


## Directions
