>- The IPv6 CLB is in beta test. To try it out, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=6&level2_id=163&source=0&data_title=%E8%B4%9F%E8%BD%BD%E5%9D%87%E8%A1%A1%20LB&step=1).
>- Currently, IPv6 CLB is only supported in the following regions: Guangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Chengdu, Chongqing, Hong Kong (China), Singapore, and Virginia.
>- IPv6 CLB does not support classic CLB.
>- IPv6 CLB supports obtaining the client's IPv6 source address, which can be directly obtained by layer-4 IPv6 CLB or through the `X-Forwarded-For` header of HTTP layer-7 IPv6 CLB.
>- Currently, IPv6 CLB balances the load completely over the public network. Clients in the same VPC cannot access IPv6 CLB over the private network.
>- IPv6 implementations are still at the preliminary stage across the internet. In case of access failure, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category?level1_id=6&level2_id=163&source=0&data_title=%E8%B4%9F%E8%BD%BD%E5%9D%87%E8%A1%A1%20LB&step=1).

## Overview
IPv6 load balancing is implemented based on the IPv6 single stack technology. It can collaborate with IPv4 CLB to implement IPv6/IPv4 dual-stack communication. An IPv6 CLB instance is bound to an IPv6 address of a CVM instance and provides an IPv6 VIP address.

### IPv6 CLB Advantages
Tencent Cloud IPv6 CLB has the following advantages when helping your business quickly connect to IPv6:
- **Quick connection:** CLB enables connection to IPv6 in a matter of seconds and is available upon purchase.
- **Ease of use:** IPv6 CLB is compatible with IPv4 CLB flowchart and easy to use with no additional learning costs incurred.
- End-to-end IPv6 communication: IPv6 CLB instances communicate with CVM instances over IPv6, which helps applications deployed on the CVM instances quickly upgrade to IPv6 and implement end-to-end IPv6 communication.

### IPv6 CLB Architecture
CLB supports creating IPv6 CLB instances. Tencent Cloud will assign an IPv6 public IP address, i.e., VIP of the IPv6 edition, to an IPv6 CLB instance, and the VIP will forward requests from IPv6 clients to the real IPv6 CVM instance.

An IPv6 CLB instance can support quick access of users from IPv6 public network and communicate with real servers over IPv6, which helps in-cloud applications quickly upgrade to IPv6 and implement end-to-end IPv6 communication.

The IPv6 CLB architecture is as shown below:

3. After configuring the above items, click **Buy now**. On the "CLB order confirmation" pop-up window, click **Confirm order**. Then, return to [Instance Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/loadbalance/index?rid=1&forward=1) page where you can view the IPv6 CLB instance you just purchased.


## Step 2. Create an IPv6 CLB listener
1. Log in to the [CLB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/clb/index?rid=1&type=2%2C3) and click the IPv6 CLB instance ID to enter the details page.
2. Select the **Listener Management** tab, click **Create**. For example, create a TCP listener.
>?CLB supports creating layer-4 (TCP/UDP/TCP SSL) and layer-7 (HTTP/HTTPS) IPv6 CLB listeners. For more information, please see [CLB Listener Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/6151).
>
3. In "Basic Configurations", configure the name, listening protocol port, and balancing method, and click **Next**.

## More Operations
### Binding IPv6 CLB with both IPv6 and IPv4 real servers
After enabling the dual-stack binding, the IPv6 CLB layer-7 listener can be bound with both IPv4 and IPv6 backend servers, and can obtain the source IP via XFF. But layer-4 listeners only support binding of IPv6 backend server.
1. Enable dual-stack binding.
 -  Enable dual-stack binding when purchasing IPv6 CLB on the purchase page.
![]()
 -  Enable dual-stack binding on the IPv6 CLB instance details page.

2. Create a layer-7 HTTP or HTTPS listener.
3. Bind the listener with a IPv6 or IPv4 backend server.
