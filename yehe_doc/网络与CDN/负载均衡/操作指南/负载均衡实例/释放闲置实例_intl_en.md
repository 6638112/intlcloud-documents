When a pay-as-you-go instance is not configured with a listener or bound to a real server seven days after the creation, itâ€™s considered as an idle instance. To reduce unnecessary charges, please release idle instances in time.

>?The feature is currently in beta test. To try it out, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
>

## Restrictions
CLB supports batch release of idle instances in the same region only.

## Directions
>!The idle instance data can be cached for one day. Make sure that the instance to be released is not in use to prevent a release error.
