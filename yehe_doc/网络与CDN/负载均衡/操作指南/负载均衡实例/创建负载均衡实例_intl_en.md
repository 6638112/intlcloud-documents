Tencent Cloud allows you to purchase a CLB instance on the official purchase page or via API. The two methods are detailed below:

## [Purchasing at Official Website](id:Official-Purchase)
You can purchase a CLB instance on the [Tencent Cloud official website](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb). There are two types of Tencent Cloud accounts, namely the bill-by-IP accounts and bill-by-CVM accounts. The accounts created after 00:00:00 on June 17, 2020 (Beijing time) are of the bill-by-IP type. If you have created your account before that time, you can check your account type in the console as instructed in [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246).

1. Log in to the [CLB purchase page](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb).
2. Select the following CLB configuration items as needed:

	<li>Private network: CLB is used to distribute requests from the Tencent Cloud private network. A private network instance doesn't support the following configuration items and doesn't display them by default: <strong>EIP</strong>, <strong>IP Version</strong>, <strong>ISP Type</strong>, <strong>Instance Specification</strong>, <strong>Network Billing Mode</strong>, and <strong>Bandwidth Cap</strong>.</li>
	</ul>
	The supported network types vary by billing mode:
	<ul>
	<li>In pay-as-you-go billing mode, both the public and private network types are supported.</li>

	<ul>
	<li>If EIP is not selected, Tencent Cloud will assign you a public network CLB instance whose public IP cannot be changed.</li>
	<li>If EIP is selected, Tencent Cloud will assign you an EIP and a private network CLB instance, which has the similar features of public network CLB (only pay-as-you-go public network CLB instances allow you to select an EIP).

	This feature is currently in beta test. To use it, <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a> for application. For the use limits, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/44336">Use Limits</a>.

The following CLB IP versions are supported: IPv4, IPv6, and IPv6 NAT64. Only pay-as-you-go instances support the IPv6 version. For more information on other restrictions, see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/13629#IP-type">IP Versions</a>.

CLB supports classic network and VPC.
	<ul>
	<li>The classic network is a public network resource pool for all Tencent Cloud users. The private IPs of all CVMs are assigned by Tencent Cloud. You cannot customize IP ranges or IP addresses.</li>
	<li>By contrast, the VPC is a logically isolated network space in Tencent Cloud. In a VPC, you can customize IP ranges, IP addresses, and routing policies.</li>
	</ul>
	Between the two options, VPC is more suitable for scenarios requiring custom network configurations, and the classic network product will be officially discontinued on December 31, 2022. We recommend you select VPC.
