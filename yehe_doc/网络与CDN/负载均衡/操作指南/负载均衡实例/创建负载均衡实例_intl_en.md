Tencent Cloud allows you to create a CLB instance on the official purchase page or via API. The two methods are detailed below:

### Creating a CLB instance on the official purchase page
You can purchase a CLB instance on [Tencent Cloud official website](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/lb). Private network CLB instances are free of charge, while public network CLB instances charge instance fees on an hourly pay-as-you-go basis. You can purchase public network on [CVM](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/495). For more information on the network billing modes, please see [Public Network Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/10578).

For the purchase method for bill-by-CVM accounts, please see [Purchase Methods](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/8849). For users of bill-by-IP accounts, the purchase steps are as follows:
