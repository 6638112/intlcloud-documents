Starting from February 24, 2023 at 12:00:00 (UTC+8), the health check source IP of Tencent Cloud Load Balancer (CLB) will be upgraded from CLB VIP to the IP range 100.64.0.0/10, which can help prevent IP conflicts and better control the real server policies. 

For new CLB users after the upgrade, 100.64.0.0/10 IP range is used by default. Existing users can choose to remain the current VIP unchanged, or change to 100.64.0.0/10 in the console or by using API. 

| User type | Description |
|---------|---------|
|New users|Users who do not have any CLB instances by February 24, 2023 12:00:00 (UTC+8).|
|Existing users|Users who have CLB instances by February 24, 2023 12:00:00 (UTC+8).|


## Reminders
- If the associated real servers are under the same account as of the CLB instances, 100.64.0.0/10 is added to the allowlist of the security group by default. <br>  - For real servers under different accounts, users need to log in with the related account and upgrade the CLS configuration. 
- If the real server is configured with other security policies (such as iptables), this IP range must be added to the allowlist. Otherwise it can cause health check failures.
