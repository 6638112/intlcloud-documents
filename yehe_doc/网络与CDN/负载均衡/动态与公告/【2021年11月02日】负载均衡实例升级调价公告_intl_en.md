Tencent Cloud plans to upgrade the architecture of all CLB instances staring from 00:00:00, November 2, 2021 (UTC +8). After the upgrade, the guaranteed performance of each shared CLB instance will be increased to 50,000 concurrent connections, 5,000 new connections per second, and 5,000 QPS.


The performance is guaranteed for each CLB instance.
>?
>- Before the upgrade, shared CLB instances share resources of one cluster, which may affect the performance in case of resource contention.
>- After the upgrade, the basic performance for every individual shared CLB instance is guaranteed. When the required performance exceeds the guaranteed value, resource contention may occur.
