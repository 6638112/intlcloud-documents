## ECDN

- **Global acceleration**

With cache nodes deployed across the world, ECDN effectively reduces cross-border access delays and ensures smooth global acceleration.

- **Optimal linkage**

Cache nodes are interconnected in pairs with real-time detection enabled to locate the optimal transfer route with the aid of Tencent Cloud's proprietary optimal linkage algorithm.

- **Intelligent caching**

You can customize the rules for caching static resources on edge servers to enable nearby access to static resources and speed up response.



## Access Security

- **Intelligent multi-origin switch**

Cache nodes actively monitor origin servers and automatically select the best-performing servers for access. In addition, cache nodes can actively eliminate faulty origin servers to ensure business stability and continuity.

- **Access control**

Access control features such as IP access limit, blocklist, and allowlist are supported.

- **HTTPS support**

Full-linkage transfer over HTTPS is supported to quickly transfer encrypted data, ensuring high data security.

- **Origin server hiding**

With ECDN, your real origin server addresses can be hidden behind the ECDN acceleration network to avoid the security risks caused by address exposure.
