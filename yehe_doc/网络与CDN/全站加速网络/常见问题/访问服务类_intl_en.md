### How do I get the cache node IP accessed by a client?

The ECDN platform uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header field to pass user's real IP address for origin-pull by default.

### Why is the obtained client IP address different from the user's real IP address?

If the client IP address obtained by the origin server from the `X-Forwarded-For` field is different from the user's real IP address, it may be caused by the following factors and can be solved in the following ways:

### What should I do if an exceptional status code is returned for access with ECDN?

The causes and solutions for common exceptional ECDN status codes are as follows:

### How do I quickly locate a domain name access exception?

1. Check for the domain name resolution problem.
   - Check whether the domain name resolution takes effect through DNS resolution and check whether the problem is caused by incorrect authoritative DNS resolution.
   - Check whether the client can get the node IP normally to confirm whether the user's local DNS resolution is exceptional.
2. Compare the response content before and after the acceleration.
   - If the response of direct access to the origin server is exceptional, the access failure may be caused by exceptional origin server service.
   - If the response of direct access to the origin server is normal, the problem may be related to the ECDN platform and needs further troubleshooting. 
3. Confirm the affection scope.
   - If access requests of only a small number of users are exceptional, the problem is generally caused by the client network. In this case, you can change the access network or access node and try again.
   - If affected users are in a certain region or ISP, the problem may be caused by service exceptions on some nodes, and you should immediately [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
   - If access requests of all users are affected, the problem may be related to the origin server or acceleration platform, and you should immediately [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for troubleshooting.
4. Check whether the problem can be reproduced.
   - The problem is occasional and cannot be reproduced. It is generally caused by ISP network jitters and can be recovered automatically.
   - The problem can be reproduced when the access request is sent again. You can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) describing the access environment and error symptoms for assistance.
