### Quintuple
A quintuple refers to a collection of five values: source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and transport layer protocol.
**Example:**
`192.168.1.1`, `10000`, `TCP`, `121.14.88.76`, `80` constitute a quintuple. In this case, this refers to a terminal with an IP address of `192.168.1.1` and port `10000` that is connecting with a terminal with the IP address of `121.14.88.76` and port `80` using the TCP.
