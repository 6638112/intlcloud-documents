Dear user,
To offer you better experience, Tencent Cloud will stop supporting flow log collection for [restricted models](#limit) from July 25, 2022. From April 26, 2022, users can no longer create flow logs to collect data from restricted [models](#limit). If you have any flow log instances deployed on the restricted models, we recommend you delete the instances if they are no longer needed to increase the stability and quality of network operations for your business. For more information, see [Delete Flow Logs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/682/18968). If you still require the instances, please upgrade the configuration of your Cloud Virtual Machine (CVM) instances. For more information, see [Changing Instance Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2178).

## Restricted Models[](id:limit)

- Standard: S3, SA1, S2, and S1

- Batch compute: BC1 and BS1

## FAQs
### What are the risks if I do not upgrade the configuration of my CVM instances?
From **July 25, 2022**, some models (see [Restricted Models](#limit)) no longer support data collection by using flow logs. To continue using flow logs to collect data from these models, you must upgrade the configuration of your CVM instances. For more information, see [Changing Instance Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2178). For other questions, please contact your sales rep or [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### Does upgrading the configuration of my CVM instances increase my costs?
This depends on the model that you select. For more information, see [Changing Instance Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2178).

### Are the existing flow log instances deployed on restricted models forcibly terminated?
No. Existing flow log instances on restricted models are not forcibly terminated when you upgrade the configuration of your CVM instances.

### How does the upgrade of the configuration of my CVM instances affect flow logs?
Flow logs on restricted models record information only in the value format, whereas those on other models support the key-value format. For more information, see [Features > Flow Log Record](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/682/18933).
