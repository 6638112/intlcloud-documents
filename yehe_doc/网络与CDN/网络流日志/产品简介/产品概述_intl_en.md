Tencent Cloud Flow Logs (FL) provides a full-time, full-flow and non-intrusive traffic collection service. FL enables you to store and analyze the collected network flow in real time for troubleshooting, compliance auditing, architecture optimization, and security detection. With FL, your cloud networks will become more stable, secure, and intelligent.

- You can create FLs for ENIs to collect incoming/outgoing traffic. After a FL is created, you can view and search for its data in [Cloud Log Storage (CLS)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614). You can also publish specified FLs to other Tencent Cloud products for analysis or storage. For example, you can publish a flow log to a COS bucket to manage its lifecycle.

>?The FL service is currently in beta. To try it out, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
