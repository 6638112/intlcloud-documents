Tencent Cloud Flow Logs (FL) provides a full-time, full-flow and non-intrusive traffic collection service. FL enables you to store and analyze the collected network flow in real time for troubleshooting, compliance auditing, architecture optimization, and security detection. With FL, your cloud networks will become more stable, secure, and intelligent.

You can create a flow log within the specified collection range (such as ENI, NAT Gateway, and cross-region CCN traffic) to collect inbound/outbound traffic within the range. Then, you can view and search for data in [CLS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/614/11254), as well as view log data in the advanced analysis dashboard.

>?The FL service for NAT Gateway and cross-region CCN traffic is currently in beta. To try it out, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
