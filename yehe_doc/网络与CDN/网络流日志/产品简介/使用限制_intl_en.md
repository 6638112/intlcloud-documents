## Notes
- FL only supports the collection of flow logs of ENI, NAT Gateways, and cross-region CCN traffic within the specified VPC range but not in the classic network.
>?The FL service for NAT Gateway and cross-region CCN traffic is currently in beta. To try it out, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
- The configurations of a flow log cannot be modified after creation. For example, the cloud log service (CLS) to which the flow log is published cannot be modified.
- FL does not support capturing the following IP traffic:
  - Traffic generated by Windows instances for activation of Windows license.
  - DHCP traffic.
- Only one flow log can be created for each ENI.
- FL collects the original outbound traffic and limited inbound traffic of the ENI on a CVM.
Assume you create a flow log for the ENI on a CVM:
   - When the CVM accesses the public network through a cloud load balancer, the "1" traffic will be collected for the outbound direction and the "2" traffic will be collected for the inbound direction.
   - When the CVM accesses the public network through a NAT Gateway, the "3" traffic will be collected for the outbound direction and the "4" traffic will be collected for the inbound direction.

## Dashboard-Enabled Flow Log Types[](id:gjfxgn)
Currently, advanced analysis dashboards can be created and viewed only for flow logs of the ENI type in the logset and log topic with the "Flowlog" flag.
>?In [Topic Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/682/47038), you can create a logset "flowlog_logset" and log topic with the "Flowlog" flag.
