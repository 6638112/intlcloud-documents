### What is Tencent Cloud Bandwidth Package?
Tencent Cloud Bandwidth Package (BWP) is a multi-IP aggregated traffic billing mode. If you enable BWP in the Guangzhou region, all your devices in this region can be billed by BWP.

### How Do I Enable BWP?

### What Types of BWP Are Available?
There are two types of Tencent Cloud BWPs, Device BWP and IP BWP. For more information, please see [Product Types](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15245).

### What is the difference between the two types of BWPs?
- When Device BWP is enabled, all CVMs and CLBs in the region will be automatically billed in the package.
- When IP BWP is enabled, all public IPs, EIPs, CLBs and Elastic IPv6 added to the package will be billed in the package.

### What changes have taken place in BWPs before and after account type upgrade?
Tencent Cloud accounts consist of bill-by-IP accounts and bill-by-CVM accounts. Bill-by-CVM accounts will no longer support new features in the later period. If your are using a bill-by-CVM account, we recommend upgrading it to a bill-by-IP account. For more information, please see [Checking Account Type](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15246). After upgrading, the Device BWP is automatically switched to the IP BWP. The original instances billed by BWPs are automatically added to IP BWPs, but the new instances shall be manually added to IP BWPs.
