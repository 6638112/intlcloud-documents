A VPN tunnel is an encrypted public network tunnel used to transmit data packets in a VPN connection. The VPN tunnel on Tencent Cloud uses the IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocol to establish a session when implementing IPsec. Featuring a self-protection mechanism, IKE can securely verify identities, distribute keys, and establish IPSec sessions on insecure networks. This document describes how to create a VPN tunnel on the [ VPC Console ](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpnConn?rid=25).

The following configuration information is required to create a VPN tunnel:
+ [Basic information](#buzhou4)
+ [Communication mode](#buzhou6)
+ [IKE configuration (optional)](#buzhou7)
+ [IPsec configuration (optional)](#buzhou8)

## Prerequisites
+ The VPN gateway and customer gateway have been configured.
+ The local and customer IP ranges of the VPN tunnel in the SPD policy cannot overlap.
+ The customer IDC must configure a static public IP.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **VPN Connection** > **VPN Tunnel** in the left sidebar.
3. In the **VPN Connections** page, click **Create**.
4. Configure the basic information of the VPN tunnel in the pop-up dialog box.[](id:buzhou4)

 - Destination route
The routing policy specifies which IP ranges in the IDC the network to which the VPN gateway belongs can communicate with. After creating a tunnel, you need to configure the routing policy in the route table of the VPN gateway. For more information, see [Configuring Tencent Cloud Routing Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/39690).
 - SPD policy
>?
>+ An SPD policy consists of a series of SPD rules to specify the IP ranges in a VPC or CCN and an IDC that can communicate with each other. Each SPD rule contains one CIDR block for the local IP range and at least one for the customer IP range. A CIDR block for the local IP range and a CIDR block for the customer IP range form a mapping. An SPD rule may involve multiple mappings.
>+ The rules for all tunnels of the same VPN gateway cannot contain overlapped mappings. In other words, the local IP range and customer IP range in a mapping cannot have a duplicate address range.
>
**Example:**
As shown in the figure below, a VPN gateway has the following SPD rules:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/aecbf567f760333e4af98ee1b0439d70.jpg)
 - SPD rule 1: the local IP range is 10.0.0.0/24, and the customer IP ranges are 192.168.0.0/24 and 192.168.1.0/24. Two mappings are available.
 - SPD rule 2: the local IP range is 10.0.1.0/24, and the customer IP range is 192.168.2.0/24. One mapping is available.
 - SPD rule 3: the local IP range is 10.0.1.0/24, and the customer IP range is 192.168.2.0/24. One mapping is available.
 The mappings are as follows:
 - 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.0.0/24
 - 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.1.0/24
 - 10.0.1.0/24-----192.168.2.0/24
 - 10.0.2.0/24-----192.168.2.0/24
The four mappings cannot overlap. In other words, the local IP range and customer IP range in a mapping cannot have a duplicate address range.
 - A new mapping 10.0.0.0/24-----192.168.1.0/24 cannot be added to SPD rules because it overlaps with an existing mapping.
 - A new mapping 10.0.1.0/24-----192.168.1.0/24 can be added to SPD rules because it does not overlap with any of the existing mappings.
