4. [Configure a route within VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/39690).
Configure the routing and forwarding policies for the mobile client to connect with Tencent Cloud VPC. Set an address of the client IP range as the destination, and VPN tunnel as the next hop type. Next hop to SSL VPN gateway.
5. Configure the client on the mobile device.
