A VPN gateway is a VPN connection instance. Therefore, please create an IPsec VPN gateway before using a VPN connection to securely access the Tencent Cloud Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) from external networks. This document shows you how to create a VPN gateway in the console.

## Prerequisites
To create a VPC-based VPN gateway, you need to create a VPC in the same region as the VPN gateway first. For more information, see [Creating VPCs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **VPN Connections** > **VPN Gateway** in the left directory to enter the admin page.
3. Click **+New**.
4. Configure the following gateway parameters in the pop-up window.
>?
>- 200 Mbps, 500 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps bandwidths are currently only available in North China (Beijing), East China (Shanghai), South China (Guangzhou), Southwest China (Chengdu),  Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan regions of China(Hong Kong, China), East China (Nanjing) and other availability zones. To use them, please <a href="https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category">submit a ticket</a>.
>- Only new gateways but not existing gateways are supported on 200 Mbps, 500 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps bandwidths.
>- If the VPN gateway uses 200 Mbps, 500 Mbps, or 1,000 Mbps bandwidths, AES128+MD5 is recommended for VPN tunnel encryption.

<dx-alert infotype="notice" title="">
You cannot associate the CCN-based VPN gateway with a CCN instance during its creation. You can associate a created VPN gateway to a CCN instance in the gateway details page. If you create a policy-based VPN tunnel, you also need to enable the route published to the CCN in the IDC IP range of the VPN gateway.
