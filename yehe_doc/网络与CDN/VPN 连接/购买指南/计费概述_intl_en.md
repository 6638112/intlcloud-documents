#### Billing example
Assume a user purchases 50 Mbps VPN gateway in Beijing with the bill-by-traffic option and uses a total of 5 GB traffic between 07:00:00-07:59:59, then at 08:00:00, the user will be required to pay the following fees:
+ Traffic fee: the traffic price is 0.12 USD/GB in Beijing. Traffic fee = traffic price * used traffic = 0.12 USD/GB * 5 GB = 0.6 USD
+ Gateway fee: the price of 50 Mbps VPN gateway in Beijing region is 0.078 USD/hr. Gateway fee = gateway price * duration = 0.078 USD/hr * 1 hour = 0.078 USD

Total fee = traffic fee + gateway fee = 0.6 USD + 0.078 USD = 0.678 USD
