After configuring the Tencent Cloud VPN gateway, VPN tunnel, customer gateway, and users’ local IDC, you can use a Ping command to activate the tunnel. The step is to verify whether Tencent Cloud connects to the user.

Ping an IP address in the peer IP range from Cloud Virtual Machine in the VPC.
 - If the Ping action succeeds, Tencent Cloud connects to the user’s VPN tunnel.
 - If the Ping action fails, please check the customer’s local IDC configuration. For technical support, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
