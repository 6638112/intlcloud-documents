You can use the CVM in the VPC to ping an IP address in the customer IP range to activate the VPN tunnel. A successful ping indicates that VPC and IDC can communicate with each other.
For example, you can use the CVM in subnet A of VPC1 to ping the server IP address in the subnet of the customer IDC: ping 10.0.1.7.
