This file introduces how to create a VPN gateway.
## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. Click **VPN Connection** > **VPN Gateway** in the left directory to enter the admin page.
3. Choose a region, for example, **Guangzhou**, and click **+Create**.
>? If the **+Create** button is grayed out and “No VPC available” is displayed when the mouse hovers over it, [create a VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805) before creating the VPN gateway. 
>
4. Enter a name for the VPN gateway (for example, TomVPNGw), select the associate network, subordinate network, bandwidth limit, labels, and billing method, and click **Create**. After the VPN gateway is created, the system randomly assigns a public IP address, for example, `203.195.147.82`.
