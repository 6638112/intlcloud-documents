### Can multiple IDCs communicate with each other by using a VPN gateway?
Yes. You can use **VPN for Cloud Connect Network (CCN)** to allow multiple IDCs that do not require access to cloud resources to communicate with each other. In this case, each IDC uses its own IPsec VPN devices to access the VPN gateway for CCN, without being associated with a CCN instance, for traffic forwarding.

### Can multiple IDCs communicate with a VPC by using a VPN gateway?
Yes. You can create a VPN gateway for CCN and associate the gateway with a CCN instance. In this case, each IDC uses its own IPsec VPN devices to access the VPN gateway for CCN to communicate with a VPC.

### Can I implement redundant communication by using a DC connection as the primary connection and a VPN connection as the secondary connection?
Yes. You can create a VPC-based Direct Connect (DC) gateway and a VPC-based VPN gateway. Then, you can create a DC connection and a VPN connection. Based on the VPC route priority, the DC connection serves as the primary connection and the VPN connection serves as the secondary connection. This allows you to implement redundant communication. For more information, see Hybrid Cloud Primary/Secondary Communication (DC and VPN).

### How do I implement primary/secondary disaster recovery?
You can use Tencent Cloud VPN Connections to implement primary/secondary disaster recovery. To be specific, you can create two IPsec VPN tunnels (route table) and configure the subnet routing, gateway routing, as well as routing weights. For more information, see [Connecting IDC to a Single Tencent Cloud VPC for Primary/Secondary Disaster Recovery](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/41975).

### Does Tencent Cloud VPN Connections support primary/secondary disaster recovery based on ECMP?
No. Tencent Cloud VPN Connections does not support Equal-Cost Multipath Routing (ECMP). However, you can use Tencent Cloud VPN Connections to implement primary/secondary disaster recovery in the following way: Create two IPsec VPN tunnels (route table) and configure the subnet routing, gateway routing, as well as routing weights. For more information, see [Connecting IDC to a Single Tencent Cloud VPC for Primary/Secondary Disaster Recovery](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/41975).
