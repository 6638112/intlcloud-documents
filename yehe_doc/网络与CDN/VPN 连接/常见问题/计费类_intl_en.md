### What's the billing mode for VPN connections?
- VPN tunnels and customer gateways are free of charge, but VPN gateways are charged.
- VPN gateways are pay-as-you-go. For more information, see [Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/32685).

For additional VPC pricing information, see [Purchase Guide](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/35500).

### Why can't I renew or upgrade VPN gateways?
A VPN gateway cannot be renewed and upgraded at the same time. If you have an unpaid renewal or upgrade order, other renewal or upgrade operations cannot be performed. The system invalidates unpaid renewal or upgrade orders at 24:00 every day, after which you must re-submit your order.

### Will I receive a reminder when my VPN gateway expires?
For more information, please see [Expiration Notifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/32687).

### Is SSL VPN supported?
Yes. The SSL VPN beta test has ended, and it will be officially commercialized on April 6, 2022.

### I have deleted the VPN connection, why is it still incurring fees?
A VPN connection is hourly postpaid in pay-as-you-go billing mode (billed hourly; time less than an hour is counted as an hour). If you use a connection during 12:02–13:20, fees will be incurred for two hours (12:00–13:00 and 13:00–14:00). In addition, the billing time in pay-as-you-go mode is not fixed and may be delayed; for example, fees for 13:00–14:00 may be billed after 14:00 or 15:00.
