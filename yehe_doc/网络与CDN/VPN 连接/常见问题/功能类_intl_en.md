### How does a VPN gateway work? How about its availability?
- A VPN gateway uses the network functions virtualization (NFV) and an active-active hot backup mechanism. When one server fails, automatic switchover helps ensure the normal operation of your businesses.
- Because a VPN tunnel runs on the public network, congestion, jitter, or delay on the public network may affect the VPN network. If your business is sensitive to delay and jitter, we recommend using the [Direct Connect](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216).

### Why does the monitoring data displayed on the VPN gateway and VPN tunnel sometimes differ?
Currently, VPN gateway and VPN tunnel collect data at a different interval. The statistical granularity of the VPN gateway is 1 minute, and that of the VPN tunnel is 10 seconds. Therefore, the statistical data shown on the monitoring page of the VPN gateway may be different from that of the VPN tunnel.
