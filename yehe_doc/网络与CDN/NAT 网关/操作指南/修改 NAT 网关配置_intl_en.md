After creating a NAT gateway, you can modify its properties.
1. Log in to the [Virtual Private Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. In the list, click the ID of the desired NAT gateway to go to its details page, where you can perform the following operations.
 - Change the name of the gateway.
 - Change the gateway type. Once made, this change takes effect immediately. Changing the gateway type does not lead to network disconnection.
 - Change the outbound bandwidth cap.
 - Add a label for permission management.
