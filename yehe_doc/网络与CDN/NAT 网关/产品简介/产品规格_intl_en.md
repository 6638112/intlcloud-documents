### Configuration Specifications
NAT Gateway supports binding up to 10 EIPs, and a maximum of 5 Gbps traffic surge and 10,000,000 concurrent connections, while providing three configuration specifications:
- Small-scale (a maximum of 1000,000 connections)
- Medium-scale (a maximum of 3000,000 connections) 
- Large-scale (a maximum of 10,000,000 connections)

>?Restricted by standard protocols, for the NAT gateways with the same protocol/destination IP/destination port, the number of maximum connections = the number of bound EIPs Ã— 55000. To increase the number of connections, bind new EIPs or adjust the destination IP/port.
