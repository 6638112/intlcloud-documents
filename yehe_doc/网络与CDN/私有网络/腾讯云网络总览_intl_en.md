## Practical Guidance
The following describes the Tencent Cloud network services that can be used in different use cases.

### On-cloud network

#### Use case 1. One CVM instance accessing the internet
+  If you purchase a CVM instance and assign a common public IP, the instance is interconnected with the internet.
+  If no common public IP is assigned during CVM instance purchase, you can apply for an EIP and bind it to the CVM instance. Then, the CVM instance is interconnected with the internet via the EIP. For more information, see [CVM Access to Internet Through EIP](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/45484). For more information on how to implement IPv6 public network access, see Setting up IPv6 VPC.
   

#### Use case 2. Multiple CVM instances accessing the internet
If multiple CVM instances in a VPC need to access the internet, you can purchase a NAT gateway and use its SNAT service, so that these CVM instances can access the internet through the same public IP. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1015/30251).

#### Use case 3. Internet traffic distribution
Cloud Load Balancer (CLB) provides a secure and fast traffic distribution service. When the internet accesses Tencent Cloud services, the access traffic can be automatically distributed to multiple CVM instances via CLB, which expands the system's service capabilities and eliminates single points of failure. For more information, see [Getting Started with CLB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/8975).

#### Use case 4. Network cost saving
+ When a shared traffic package is used, all your CVM instances, EIPs, EIP IPv6 addresses, CLB instances, and NAT gateways billed by traffic for the public network can be more cost-effective.
+ Bandwidth package (BWP) is a multi-IP aggregated billing mode that can significantly save public network costs. When the public network traffic peaks of your businesses are distributed over different time periods, you can use BWP to aggregate the fees, which is cheaper than purchasing bandwidth for each device. For more information, see [Billing Modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/684/15255).

### Cross-region network interconnection
Tencent Cloud supports interconnection of VPCs in different regions, which can be implemented in the following ways:

#### Use case 1. Connecting two VPCs in different regions
VPCs in different regions (under the same account or different accounts) can be interconnected through a peering connection. For more information, see [Peering Connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/553/18835).

#### Use case 2. Connecting multiple VPCs in different regions
Multiple VPCs in multiple regions (under the same account or different accounts) can be interconnected over CCN. For more information, see [Cloud Connect Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30045).


### Hybrid cloud network interconnection
Tencent Cloud provides the following service capabilities to interconnect a VPC and a local IDC.
+ If you want to quickly interconnect a VPC and a local IDC with an insensitive latency, you can use VPN Connections. For more information, see [VPN Connections](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1037/43324).
+ If you want to interconnect a VPC and a local IDC with a high security, sensitive latency, and dedicated network linkage, you can use Direct Connect. For more information, see [Getting Started](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/7557).
+ If you want to interconnect a local IDC with multiple VPCs or other IDCs over the entire network, you can use CCN simply by associating the target VPCs and IDCs with the same CCN instance. For more information, see [Getting Started with the CCN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/31985).
