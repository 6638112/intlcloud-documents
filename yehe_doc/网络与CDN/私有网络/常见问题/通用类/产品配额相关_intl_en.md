- Each Tencent Cloud account can apply for up to 20 EIPs in each region.
- For each Tencent Cloud account, the daily upper limit of purchase chances defaults to 40 (quota * 2). After an EIP is unbound, each account can be reassigned with public IP addresses for 10 times per day free of charge. 
- Each bill-by-CVM account has a free daily quota of 10 chances to get public IP addresses after unbinding an EIP. For more information, see the **Quota Limits** section in [Elastic IP (EIP)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5733).
