## Creating a Classiclink
A Classiclink associates classic network-based CVMs with a VPC to enable interconnection between the VPC and the classic network. This allows classic network-based CVMs to communicate with VPC resources.
>?
>- The private IPs of the associated classic network-based CVMs will be automatically added to the local policy of the VPC's route table. This allows interconnection, without the need to manually modify the routing policy of the VPC.
>- After the classic network-based CVM is associated with a VPC, their firewall and network ACL settings will remain effective.
