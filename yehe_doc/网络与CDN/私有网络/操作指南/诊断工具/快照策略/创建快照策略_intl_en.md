When you need to back up security group rules to meet subsequent business needs or roll back to the original rules due to new rule exceptions, you can configure a snapshot policy.
>!
>+ This feature is currently in beta test. To try it out, [contact us](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/42675) for application; otherwise, you cannot see **Snapshot Policy**.
>+ Authorize the COS service: As snapshot records are stored in a COS bucket, you need to perform read and write operations on COS. If you have not authorized the COS service when creating the snapshot policy, the system will automatically pop up a window for you to perform authorization as prompted. After performing the authorization, you can refresh the page to enter the snapshot policy page. No more authorization is required after that.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/) and select **Diagnostic Tools** > **Snapshot Policy** on the left sidebar.
