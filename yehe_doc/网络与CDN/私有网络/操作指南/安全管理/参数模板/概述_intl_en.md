A parameter template is a set of IP address or protocol port parameters. You can save IP addresses or protocol ports with the same needs as a template so that you can directly import the template as the source/destination IP or protocol port when adding security group rules. Parameter templates, if properly used, can enhance your efficiency in using security groups.

## Use Cases
Parameter templates are mainly suitable for the following scenarios:
- Manage multiple IP addresses or protocol port groups with the same requirements.
- Manage multiple IP addresses or protocol port groups with frequent editing needs.
