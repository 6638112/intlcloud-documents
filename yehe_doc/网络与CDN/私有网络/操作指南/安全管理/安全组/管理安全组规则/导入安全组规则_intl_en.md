> 
> - If security group rules already exist in the security group to which you want to import rules, we recommend that you export these rules first. Otherwise, the imported rules will overwrite the existing ones.
> - If no security group rule exists in the security group to which you want to import rules, we recommend that you first download the template file, edit the template file, and then import the file.
