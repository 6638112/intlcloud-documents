CCN connects a VPC with another or with IDCs. This document describes how to create a CCN.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [CCN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/ccn).
2. Click **+Create** at the top of the **CCN** page. 
3. Complete the following configurations in the **Create a CCN instance** pop-up window.

4. Click **OK**.

## Subsequent Operations
After creating a CCN instance, you need to associate network instances with it, check its route table, and configure the bandwidth to enable interconnection.
- For more information on how to associate network instances, see [Associating Network Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30064).
- For more information on how to check whether the routing policies of each subnet in the VPC associated with the CCN take effect, see [Viewing Routing Information](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30066).
- For pay-as-you-go CCN instances billed by monthly 95th percentile, you can configure a cross-region bandwidth cap as needed to control the bandwidth cost. For detailed directions, see [Configuring Bandwidth](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/38894).
