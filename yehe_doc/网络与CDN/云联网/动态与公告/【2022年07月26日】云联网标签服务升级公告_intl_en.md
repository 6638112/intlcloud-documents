Tencent Cloud will undergo an upgrade of the CCN tagging feature on July 26, 2022 from 0:00-2:00 (UTC+8). The upgrade information is as follows:

## Removing the Regional Attribute from the CCN Tags
  For now, CCN tags have the regional attributes. For example, you tag the instance CCN A in Guangzhou region with "test1:A", and tag it in Shanghai region with "test2:B". When you query tags of CCN - A, "test1:A" is returned for Guangzhou region, and "test2:B" is returned for Shanghai region.
  However CCN service does not have any regional restrictions and differences. Adding the regional attributes brings in unnecessary. After the upgrade, the regional attributes of the CCN tags are removed, which means you do not need to specify the region ID for adding and querying tags. For example, after the upgrade, when you query tags of CCN - A, both "test1:A" and "test2:B" are returned.
  After the upgrading, all existing tags of CCN instances are updated to tags without regional attributes. 
<table>
<tr>
<th>CCN instance </th>
<th>Before upgrade (with regional attribute)</th>
<th>After upgrade (without regional attribute)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CCN - A</td>
<td>Guangzhou: test1:A</br>
Shanghai: test2:B</td>
<td>test1:A, test2:B</td>
</tr>
<table>

## Upgrade Impact
 - During the upgrade, CCN data transmission and API calls are not affected.
 - During the upgrade, both the tags with/without regional attributes are returned for tag queries.
 - After the upgrade, the regional attribute will be removed from all existing tags. Newly created tags do not include the regional attribute. Please note this upgrade in advance to avoid business impact.
