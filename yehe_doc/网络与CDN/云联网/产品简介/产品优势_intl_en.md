## Full-mesh
Tencent Cloud Connect Network (CCN) provides enterprise-level network services that support single-point access and full-mesh interconnection. CCN features multi-node multi-route-level automatic forwarding and syncing on the public and private network and route convergence in seconds, which allows you to interconnect all network instances with a simple step.

## Smart scheduling
CCN frees you from the heavy route maintenance with its Full Mesh interconnection between multiple nodes and links in public and private networks. The smart scheduling system monitors the multi-layer network topology, routes, and traffic of the entire network to connect your local services to the nearest point and ensure interconnection using the shortest link.

## Fast transmission
Tencent Cloud operates interconnected IDCs in more than 30 regions around the globe. Any two network instances associated with the CCN are interconnected via the shortest path on the private network. Therefore, there is no need to worry about bypassing public networks or possible link congestion. This greatly reduces the network latency for global multi-point interconnections to ensure high-speed data transmission.

## Cost effective
CCN supports monthly 95th percentile billing on a pay-as-you-go basis. 

## Secure and reliable
