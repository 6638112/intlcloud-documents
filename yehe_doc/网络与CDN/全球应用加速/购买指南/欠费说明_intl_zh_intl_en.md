## Overdue Payment

If your Tencent Cloud account becomes overdue, you will receive notifications through SMS, email, etc. A 24-hour grace period is provided, during which you can still use the GAAP service. GAAP service is suspended when the payment is not made when the grace period ends.

### Going Overdue
GAAP is a pay-as-you-go service that adopts prepay account freezing. The system calculates and deducts the service fee of the previous day and freezes the amount of the minimum connection fee in the available account balance. If your account balance is not enough, it goes negative and your account becomes overdue.

>! The overdue payment policy applies no matter whether the overdue payment is caused by the usage of GAAP. 

### Overdue Payment Alerts
An overdue payment alert is sent when your credit goes negative. Note that the alert is only sent once.

### Clearing Overdue Payment
The GAAP service is recovered once the overdue payment is made.
>! The configurations of your acceleration connections are kept for seven days. If the payment is made within seven days, the GAAP service is recovered automatically. Otherwise, your acceleration connections are terminated and cannot be recovered.
