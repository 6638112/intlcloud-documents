Only layer-4 TCP allows TOA to obtain the real client IP. Please enable TOA in the acceleration connection as follows:

Log in to the [GAAP console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/gaap). Select **Access Management** > **TCP/UDP Listener Management**. Click **Create** to add a TCP listener and select TOA, and then complete configurations required to create the listener and connection.
