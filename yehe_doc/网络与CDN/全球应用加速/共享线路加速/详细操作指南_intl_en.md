### TCP/UDP listener management
1. Create a listener
Go to the **Platform Management** page and click the ID of the target platform to enter the platform details page. Select the **TCP/UDP Listener Management** tab, click **Create**, configure the listener information in the pop-up window, and click **OK** to create a forwarding rule.
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/33b6eff9530c5133a11155d2cc3eb1b9.png)
>! Set **Protocol** and *Get client IP** based on your actual business protocol. If the secondary origin server is enabled, the protocol can be TCP only.

![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/6ac3b171bd051529c2c2644459d61d43.png)

 -	Listener name: Enter a custom listener name, which can contain up to 30 characters.
 -	Get client IP: You can select **TOA** or **Proxy Protocol**.
 -	Protocol: It uses the default configuration and does not need to be entered.
 -	Listening port: Access port of the acceleration line, which cannot be modified after the configuration is submitted.
Value range: 1-64999 (36000 and 56000 are unavailable). You can click **Add** to add multiple port records. Up to 20 ports can be added during each listener creation. The listening ports of each acceleration platform must be unique.
 -	Origin Type: Select **IP** or **Domain Name**.
 -	Origin-pull policy: If the origin type is **IP**, you can select **RR** or **Weighted RR**. If the origin type is **Domain Name**, you can select **RR** only.
 -	Origin-pull Address: Enter the origin server address, which can contain up to 80 characters. The value range of the origin server port is 1â€“65535.
	1. If the origin type is **IP**, you can click **Add** to add up to nine origin servers, and only IPv4 IPs are supported. If the origin type is **Domain Name**, you can add only one origin server.
	2. The origin server port refers to the port accessed during origin-pull.
	3. A weight ranges from 1 to 100, and the system calculates the origin-pull ratio of different origin servers based on their weights. For example, if you configure three origin server: A, B, and C, whose weights are 10, 20, and 30 respectively, then 10/(10+20+30) requests will be forwarded to origin server A, 20/(10+20+30) requests to B, and 30/(10+20+30) requests to C.
 -	Secondary origin: It is disabled by default. If you select **Enable**, you need to configure the secondary origin-pull policy and address.
 -	Origin-pull policy: Same as the primary origin server's **origin-pull policy**. 
 -	Origin-pull address: Its type can only be the same as that of the primary origin server's **origin-pull Address**.
2.	Modify a listener
Go to the **Platform Management** page and click the ID of the target platform to enter the platform details page. Select the **TCP/UDP Listener Management** tab, click **Modify** in the **Operation** column of the target listener, modify the listener information (the protocol and listening port cannot be modified) in the pop-up window, and click **OK**.
3.	Delete a listener
Go to the **Platform Management** page and click the ID of the target platform to enter the platform details page. Select the **TCP/UDP Listener Management** tab, click **Delete** in the **Operation** column of the target listener, and click **OK** in the pop-up window.

### 	Attack defense

## 4. Shared Acceleration Connection
GAAP shared acceleration currently does not support access via IP connection, and the CNAME domain name cannot be accessed directly. You need to complete the CNAME configuration at your domain name service provider. After the configuration takes effect, GAAP shared acceleration can be used normally.

1. Set a CNAME record for DNS

	-	If your DNS service provider is Tencent Cloud, configure the CNAME record as instructed in the official operation guide.
	-	If your DNS service provider is Wanwang, configure the CNAME record as instructed [here](https://help.aliyun.com/document_detail/29725.html).
	-	If you use another DNS service provider, see their particular operation guide.
2. Check whether the CNAME record takes effect
The time it takes for the CNAME record to take effect varies by DNS service provider. It is generally within half an hour. You can also run `ping` on the command line to check whether the CNAME record is in effect. If a domain name suffixed with `ovscdns.com` can be pinged, the domain name's CNAME record has taken effect.

## 5. Get the real client IP
