### How is Direct Connect billed?
Direct Connect fees include **Tencent Cloud billable items** and **non-Tencent Cloud billable items**, which can be divided into the following three parts.
For more information on billing, please see [Billing and Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/543).
- **Non-Tencent Cloud billable items:**
  - Leased-line fee: you should purchase a leased-line from a leased-line service provider. If you have any questions, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.
  - Fiber-to-the-building fee: most Tencent Cloud Direct Connect access points are deployed in data centers of neutral IDC ISPs. You should negotiate such fee with your IDC ISP.
>Generally, partners of Tencent Cloud Direct Connect have been connected to Tencent Cloud through network-to-network interface (NNI). If you decide to purchase a connection from a Tencent Cloud partner, no relevant construction will be required in Tencent Cloud, and you can deploy a hybrid cloud more quickly. 
- **Tencent Cloud billable items:**
 - Connection:
   - One-time access fee of 2,500 USD, including access fee and commissioning fee.
   - Resource occupation fee for the dedicated access port is billed at monthly pay-as-you-go. The billing started in July 2019. The fee incurred in the current month will be deducted from your account in the following month.
 - Dedicated tunnel:
   - If the Direct Connect access point and Direct Connect gateway are deployed in the same region, dedicated tunnels will be free of charge before May 1, 2020. After then, a free tier of 10 Gbps will be provided, and if you require higher bandwidth, please contact your Tencent Cloud rep.
> If you use [CCN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/product/ccn) to migrate your business to cloud services, as the dedicated tunnel and Direct Connect access point are deployed in the same region, cross-region access fee will be charged in CCN bills.
>
>    - If the Direct Connect access point and Direct Connect gateway are deployed in different regions, cross-region communication fee will be charged for dedicated tunnels.

### Do I need to pay immediately after submitting an application for a connection?
No. You can pay after a Direct Connect delivery engineer confirms your purchase with you.
