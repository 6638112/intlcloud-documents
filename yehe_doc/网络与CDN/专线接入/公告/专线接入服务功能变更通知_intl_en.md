Dear Tencent Cloud user, 

In order to further improve your user experience, we updates the Tencent Cloud Direct Connect service as follows:
1. Tencent Cloud Direct Connect no longer supports the shared connection feature since August 1, 2020 00:00:00, and you cannot apply for a shared connection via console or APIs then. However, your use of this feature on existing tunnels will be unaffected. If you want to create a connection and access Tencent Cloud, you can [apply for connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19244). For more information on the connection methods, contact your Tencent Cloud rep.
Thank you for your support.

Sincerely,  
Tencent Cloud Team
