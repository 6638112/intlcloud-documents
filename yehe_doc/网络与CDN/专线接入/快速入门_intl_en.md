Follow the steps below:
<dx-steps>
-[Create a connection](#dc): connects customer’s local IDC to Tencent Cloud.
-[Create a direct connect gateway](#dcgw): as the traffic entry of the Direct Connect, connects a Tencent Cloud VPC to connections (dedicated tunnels).
-[Create a dedicated tunnel](#conn): acts as the network segmentations of a connection.
-[Configure the route table](#route): configures a routing policy in the route table of a VPC subnet to enable connection.
- [Set alarms](#alarm): configures recipients for alarm policies automatically created together with the connection and dedicated tunnel.

5. Click **OK**.

### Step 5: set alarms[](id:alarm)
After a connection and a dedicated tunnel are created, Cloud Monitor will automatically create a default alarm policy for each service. This default alarm policy does not configure recipient information, so you can only view alarms on the console. To configure a recipient, take the following steps.
<dx-fold-block title="What is a default alarm policy?">
- Default alarm policy for connections
<table>
<tr><th>Metric</th><th>Statistical Period</th><th>Condition</th><th>Condition Value</th><th>Consecutive Periods</th><th>Policy</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>Bandwidth utilization </td><td>1 minute</td><td>>=</td><td>80%</td><td>5 periods</td><td>Alarm once a day</td></tr>
</table>
- Default alarm policy for dedicated tunnels: four types of event alarms are available, including DirectConnectTunnelDown, DirectConnectTunnelBFDDown, DirectConnectTunnelBGPSessionDown, and DirectConnectTunnelRouteTableOverload.
</dx-fold-block>

1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview).
2. Select **Alarm Configuration** > **Alarm Policy** on the left sidebar. Click **Advanced Filter** in the upper-right corner of the **Alarm Policy** page, select **All** for **Monitor Type**, and select the relevant product for **Policy type**.
3. Click the name of the target default policy in the **Alarm Policy** list.
