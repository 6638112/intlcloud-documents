After associating a CCN instance with the direct connect gateway, you need to configure a routing policy for the CCN instance, with the direct connect gateway as the next hop and IDC IP range as the destination to implement communication. The routing policy can be either manually entered (Static) or automatically synced (BGP). For more information, see [Route Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/34259). This document describes how to publish IP ranges on the direct connect gateway to CCN.
>?Up to 20 routes can be published to CCN through a direct connect gateway. To publish more routes, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

## Background
As shown in the following Direct Connect network architecture, your IDC associated with the CCN-based direct connect gateway and CCN can communicate with a Tencent Cloud VPC. The destination IP range of VPC routes to IDC is 192.168.0.0/24. After configuring the IDC IP range on the direct connect gateway, the CCN route table will add a routing policy with the direct connect gateway as the next hop and 192.168.0.0/24 as the destination to realize the route propagation.
>?If you configure multiple IDC IP ranges on the direct connect gateway, CCN will forward the route with the longest mask. For more information, see [Route Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/34259).

## Prerequisite
You have created a CCN-based direct connect gateway as instructed in [Creating Direct Connect Gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19256).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [Direct Connect console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dc/dc), and click **Direct Connect Gateway** in the left sidebar.
2. Select a region and VPC at the top of the **Direct Connect Gateway** page. Click the **ID** of the target instance to enter its details page.
	 ![]()
3. Click **Publish IP range** on the details page.
The IP range published is an IDC IP range that specifies the direct connect gateway route to CCN. When receiving the route, CCN automatically adds a route with the direct connect gateway as the next hop and IDC IP range as the destination.
4. (Optional) Associate with CCN.
    If you did not specify a CCN instance when [creating the direct connect gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19256), click **Associate with CCN**, select a CCN instance to be associated in the pop-up window, and click **OK**.
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/3a269710e1003a92e83c63bd553635c1.png)
	Then the CCN instance will be associated and the CCN icon becomes green. The dotted line between the direct connect gateway and CCN changes to solid, indicating that the interconnection between them is established.
5. Create a dedicated tunnel.
    A dedicated tunnel is the network segmentation of a connection. It provides a linkage of IDC to Tencent Cloud.
	Under the **Dedicated tunnels** icon connected with the direct connect gateway, click **Create dedicated tunnel** to redirect to the **Create dedicated tunnels** page, where you can configure a dedicated tunnel.
	![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/a604fb7eecda053a4a9a7be368a989d6.png)
	For more information on the parameter configurations, see [Applying for a Dedicated Tunnel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19250).
	Then the dedicated tunnel is created and the **Dedicated Tunnels** icon becomes green. The dotted line between direct connect gateway and dedicated tunnel changes to solid, indicating the direct connect gateway is configured with a dedicated tunnel.
6. Publish IDC IP ranges to CCN.
   After an IDC IP range is published to CCN, the CCN route is synced to the direct connect gateway, while the direct connect gateway route to CCN can be obtained depending on the publishing method of the IDC IP range.
    - Custom: the manual configuration mode. CCN obtains the specified direct connect gateway route.
    - Auto-propagation: the BGP mode. CCN automatically obtains the direct connect gateway route published from the dedicated tunnel. But the publish time of the dedicated tunnel matters.

    ::: Custom
    Formerly named **Static** or manual configuration.
   1. (Optional) Select a CCN instance in the **Publish rules** section.
      Perform this step if you want to associate one CCN instance with the direct connect gateway or change the associated CCN instance.
	   ![]()
	   <dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
      The **Publishing method** defaults to **Custom**. To switch to **Auto-propagation**, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
      </dx-alert>
   2. Select the **Custom** tab on the **IP range details** page. Click **Create** and enter the information of the IP range that is published to CCN. Click **Save**.
	    ![]()
		Then the direct connect gateway will publish the IDC IP range you entered to CCN.
       <dx-alert infotype="explain" title="">
       Up to 100 IDC IP ranges can be published. To publish more IDC IP ranges, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

::: Auto-propagation
Formerly named **BGP mode**. To use it, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
   1. (Optional) Select a CCN instance in the **Publish rules** section.
      Perform this step if you want to associate one CCN instance with the direct connect gateway or change the associated CCN instance.

- **Auto-propagation** is selected after this feature is enabled. If needed, you can select **Custom** and complete the relevant configurations.
- Either **Custom** or **Auto-propagation** can be checked.

   2. Configure IDC IP ranges.
        In the **Auto-propagation** mode, the information of IDC IP ranges will be automatically synced to the direct connect gateway. ![]()

        :::
        ::: Switching methods
        You can switch between the two methods for publishing the IDC IP ranges on the direct connect gateway to CCN.
- Switching to auto-propagation
   [Submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to enable the auto-propagation feature.
	 The custom IP ranges published to CCN will be withdrawn after switching. IDC IP ranges will be automatically synced from the direct connect gateway and published to CCN.
- Switching to custom
   Configure IP ranges to be published to CCN on the **Custom** tab on the **IP range details** page after the switching.

7. View the published IDC IP ranges.
    The published IDC IP ranges will be shown on the **IP range details** page.
