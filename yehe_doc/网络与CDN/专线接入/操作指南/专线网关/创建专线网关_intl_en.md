This document describes how to create a direct connect gateway and provides information on the inbound route.

## Prerequisites
- Apply for a connection. For more information, see [Applying for a Connection](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19244).
- If you want to use VPC, set up a VPC. For more information, see [Building Up an IPv4 VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31891).
- If you want to use CCN, set up a CCN instance. For more information, see [Creating a CCN Instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30062).
- If you want to use NAT Direct Connect Gateway, create a VPC NAT gateway.
>?NAT Direct Connect Gateway is available only for users who are added to the corresponding allowlist. To use the feature, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category). For more information about the comparison between the old and new methods for configuring the mapping parameters of NAT Direct Connect Gateway, see [Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/38746).



## Use Limits
A standard direct connect gateway supports propagating secondary CIDR blocks. Note the following limits:
- Up to 10 secondary CIDR blocks can be propagated.
- This feature is unavailable to a NAT direct connect gateway.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [Direct Connect console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dc/dc), and click **Direct connect gateway** in the left sidebar.
2. Select a region and VPC at the top of the **Direct connect gateway** page, and click **+ New**.

3. Specify gateway parameters in the pop-up window and click **OK**.

## Inbound Routes
The destination of the inbound routes (from your IDC to a Tencent Cloud VPC) are affected by both the creation time of the direct connect gateway and dedicated tunnel mode. For more information, see [Direct Connect Gateway Overview](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/216/38746).

## Related Operations
- After creating a CCN-based direct connect gateway, you need to add IDC IP ranges to the direct connect gateway to implement network communication. For more information, see [Publishing IDC IP Ranges to CCN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/39083).
- After creating a VPC-based direct connect gateway, you need to configure the VPC route table to implement network communication. For more information, see [Configuring the Route Table](https://www.tencentcloud.com/document/product/216/19259).
