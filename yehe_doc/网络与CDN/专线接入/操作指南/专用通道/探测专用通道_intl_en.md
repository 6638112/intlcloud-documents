The Direct Connect console provides a tunnel tool that sends a detection packet from Tencent Cloud IP to customer IP to test the network connectivity. After [a dedicated tunnel is created](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19250) or [modified](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19251), we recommend using the tunnel tool to test the connection between Tencent Cloud and IDC.

## Preparation
- To enable the Ping feature in a 2.0 dedicated tunnel, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
- The dedicated tunnel should be a 2.0 tunnel, which can be checked on the **Basic Information** page.

1. Log in to the [Direct Connect console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/dcConn) and click *Dedicated Tunnels** on the left sidebar to access the **Dedicated Tunnels** page.
2. Click the **ID/Name** of the target dedicated tunnel to enter its details page.
3. Select the **Tunnel tool** tab.
