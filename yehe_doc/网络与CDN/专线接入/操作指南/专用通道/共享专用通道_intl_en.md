A dedicated tunnel is a network linkage segmentation of a connection. You can create dedicated tunnels that connect to different direct connect gateways to enable communication between your on-premises IDC and multiple VPCs. This document describes how to create a shared dedicated tunnel.

## Background
CTCC, CMCC, CUCC, CITIC and other partners with A14 and A26 telecommunications qualifications have pre-established connections with Tencent connection access points. You can access Tencent Cloud by sharing the partners' connections according to your actual needs.

A shared dedicated tunnel is a dedicated tunnel created using the partner's connection. It is applicable for scenarios where there is no need for high-bandwidth access and the cloudification time is short.
The procedure for enabling a shared dedicated tunnel is as follows:
![](https://qcloudimg.tencent-cloud.cn/raw/1b2bc5e18ecb6cb7477e580a2204c3ba.jpg)

## Prerequisites
- Obtain the connection instance ID for the shared dedicated tunnel and Tencent Cloud entity accounts' UINs of the connection provider from the supplier.
- Create a direct connect gateway as instructed in [Creating Direct Connect Gateway](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19256).


## Directions
### Step 1: Apply for a dedicated tunnel
1. Log in to the [Direct Connect](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dc/conn) console.
2. On the **Dedicated Tunnels** page, click **+ New**, complete basic configurations such as name, connection type, access network, gateway region and associated direct connect gateway, and click **Next**.

>? [](id:Breakup)If **Static** is selected as the routing mode, do not directly publish the following routes: `9.0.0.0/8, `10.0.0.0/8`, `11.0.0.0/8`, `30.0.0.0/8`, `100.64.0.0/10`, `131.87.0.0/16`, `172.16.0.0/12` and `192.168.0.0/16` when configuring IDC IP ranges. Instead, you need to first split them as follows.
>- `9.0.0.0/8` is split into `9.0.0.0/9` + `9.128.0.0/9`.
>- `10.0.0.0/8` is split into `10.0.0.0/9` + `10.128.0.0/9`.

5. Click **Submit**.
After being created, the shared dedicated tunnel is in **Pending accepted** status. It will turn to be **Connected** after being approved by the connection provider.

### Step 2: Set the alarm recipient
After a dedicated tunnel is created, Tencent Cloud automatically configures four event alarms such as `DirectConnectTunnelDown`, `DirectConnectTunnelBFDDown`, `DirectConnectTunnelBGPSessionDown`, and `DirectConnectTunnelRouteTableOverload`, helping you monitor and manage your dedicated tunnels. For more information on the event alarms, see [Alarm Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/38403).
The automatically created default alarm policy is not configured with recipient information, and only supports console alarms. You can configure alarm recipients. For details, see [Configuring Alarm Policies](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/ document/product/216/38402).
