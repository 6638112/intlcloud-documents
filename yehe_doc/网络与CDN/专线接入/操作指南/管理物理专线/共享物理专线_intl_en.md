You can use connections from other accounts to set up dedicated tunnels and also share your connections with other Tencent Cloud customers.
If you are purchasing connection service from a Tencent Cloud partner, normally a shared connection, you need to ask service provider for the UIN of your service providerâ€™s account, the connection instance ID, and the VLANID. For more information, refer to [Applying for a Tunnel](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/216/19250).
