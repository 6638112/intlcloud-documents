## TKE Billing Description
The TKE service itself is currently free of charge, but fees are collected for the use of related Tencent Cloud products. Use of TKE may require the use of the following products. For more information, see the billing documents of corresponding products.

- [CVM pricing modes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2180)
- [CBS price overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2255).
- [Cloud Load Balancer Billing Description](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/8848)

>! TKE is a Kubernetes-based declarative service. If you have created IaaS resources such as CLB and CBS in TKE and no longer need to use them, please delete the corresponding service resources in the TKE Console. If you only delete the service resources in the specific service Console, TKE will recreate them and fees will continue to be incurred. For example, if you have created CLB resources in TKE, and have deleted the CLB instance in the CLB Console, TKE will recreate the CLB instance based on the declarative API.

## EKS Billing Description
EKS is pay-as-you-go and billed based on the configured resources and usage duration. For more information, see [Elastic Cluster Billing Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/34054).
