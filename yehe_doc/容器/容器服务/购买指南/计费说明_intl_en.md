The TKE service is currently free of charge, but using related Tencent Cloud products incurs fees. Using TKE may require the following products. For more information, see the billing documents of corresponding products.

> TKE is based on Kubernetes and is a declarative service. If you have created IaaS resources such as CLB load balancers or CBS disks in TKE and no longer need them, delete the corresponding Service and PersistentVolumeClaim objects from the TKE console. If you only delete the load balancers from the CLB console or the cloud disks from the CBS console, TKE will re-create them and continue to charge fees.
