## Overview

For a service in native LoadBalancer mode, a Cloud Load Balancer (CLB) can be automatically created. It first forwards traffic to a cluster through the Nodeport of the cluster, and then forwards it again through iptable or ipvs. Services in this mode can meet usersâ€™ needs in most scenarios, but in the following scenarios, **services in direct pod connection mode** are recommended:

- The source IP address needs to be obtained (local forwarding must be enabled for the non-direct connection mode)
- Higher forwarding performance is required (there are two layers of CLBs when the CLB and service are in non-direct connection mode, so performance loss is inevitable.)
- Complete health checks and session persistence are required for the pod layer (there are two layers of CLBs when the CLB and service are in non-direct connection mode, so health checks and session persistence are difficult to configure.)

## Use Limits

- The Kubernetes version of the cluster must be 1.12 or later.
- The VPC-CNI ENI mode must be enabled for the cluster network mode.
- The workloads used by a service in direct connection mode must adopt the VPC-CNI ENI mode.
- The feature limits of a CLB bound to an ENI must be satisfied. For more information, see [Binding an ENI](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/214/32520).
- When workloads in direct pod connection mode are updated, a rolling update is performed based on the health check status of the CLB, affecting the update speed.

## Directions

### Console operation instructions

1. Log in to the [TKE console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2).
2. Go to the "Create a Service" page and configure the service parameters as required by referring to the step of [Creating a Service in the Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/36833).
Configure some key parameters as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1e52f535cd9eb5712ddf6c4760952e70.png)
	- **Service Access Mode**: select **Provide Public Network Access** or **VPC Private Network Access**.
	- **Network Mode**: select **Direct CLB-Pod Connection Mode**.
	- **Workload Binding**: select **Import Workload**. In the window that appears, select the backend workload of the VPC-CNI mode.
3. Click **Create a Service** to complete the creation.

### YAML operation instructions

#### YAML example
The YAML configuration for a service in direct pod connection mode is the same as that for a common service. In this example, the annotation indicates whether to enable the direct pod connection mode.
```
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  annotations:
	service.cloud.tencent.com/direct-access: true ##Enable the direct pod connection mode
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
  type: LoadBalancer
```



#### Annotation extension
For the CLB configuration, see [CLB Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/36834). The annotation configuration is as follows:
```
service.cloud.tencent.com/tke-service-config: [tke-service-configName]
```
