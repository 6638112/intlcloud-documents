You can bind specified security group to the ENI created in VPC-CNI mode through the following methods:

## Prerequisites

- The version of IPAMD component is v3.2.0 or later version. You can check the version through image tag.
- The IPAMD component has enabled the capability of security group (not enabled by default). The startup parameter is `--enable-security-groups`.
- Currently, only multi-Pod with shared ENI mode is supported.

## Adding security group access permission for the IPAMD component role

1. Log in to the [CAM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy), select **Policies** in the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Custom Policy** in the **Policies** page.
3. In the **Select Policy Creation Method** window that pops up, click **Create by Policy Syntax** to go to the policy template page.
4. Select a blank template and click **Next** to go to the **Edit Policy** page.
5. In the **Edit Policy** page, enter the policy name and the policy syntax, and click **Complete**.
>? The policy can be named as `SecurityGroupsAccessForIPAMD`.
```
{
        "version": "2.0",
        "statement": [
            {
                "action": [
                    "cvm:AssociateNetworkInterfaceSecurityGroups",
                    "cvm:DisassociateNetworkInterfaceSecurityGroups"
                ],
                "resource": "*",
                "effect": "allow"
            }
        ]
}
```
6. In [**CAM console** > **Roles**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/role), search for the role of the IPAMD component `IPAMDofTKE_QCSRole`, click the role name to go to the role details page.
7. Click **Associate Policies**.
8. In the pop-up window, select the created custom policy `SecurityGroupsAccessForIPAMD` and click **OK**.

## Enabling Security Features for IPAMD

- Modify the existing tke-eni-ipamd deployment: `kubectl edit deploy tke-eni-ipamd -n kube-system`.
- Run the following command to add the startup parameter to `spec.template.spec.containers[0].args`.
  After modification, ipamd will restart automatically and take effect.
	After ipamd takes effect, the new ENIs and the existing ENIs that do not bind security groups will bind the security group according to the following policy.
```yaml
- --enable-security-groups
# If you want to use the security groups from the primary ENI/instance by default, you do not add the security-Groups parameter.
- --security-groups=sg-xxxxxxxx,sg-xxxxxxxx
```



## Feature Logic

- If the startup parameter `--security-groups` is not set, or its value is empty, the security group of each node will use the security group bound to the node Pod.
- After the feature is enabled, if `--security-groups` is set, the security group of each node is set to this security group set.
- Run the following command to view node security group. The `spec.securityGroups` contains the node security group information.
  ```
	kubectl get nec <nodeName> -oyaml
	```
	Run the following command to modify the node security group. The modification will take effect immediately.
	```
	kubectl edit nec <nodeName> 
	```
- After the feature is enabled, when the node is synchronized, for the new ENIs and the existing ENIs that do not bind a security group, the node security group will be bound to them. For the existing ENIs that have bound a security group, the bound security groups will be retained.
