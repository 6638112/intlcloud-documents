## Overview
Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE) allows you to create PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) and use existing PVCs when creating workloads and adding volumes so that you can manage a file system by using the PVs and PVCs.

>!Different regions support different file storage capabilities. You need to select a region based on your requirement. For more information, see [Storage Class and Performance Specification](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/33745).


## Preparations

### Creating a StorageClass via the console

To statically create a PV of the file storage type, you need to bind an available StorageClass of the same type. For more information, see [Creating a StorageClass via the Console](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/36154).

<span id="createCFS"></span>

### Creating file storage

1. Log in to the [Cloud File Storage console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cfs/fs?rid=1) and go to the **File System** page.
2. Click **Create**. On the **Create File System** page, set the parameters as required, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/379085d126949f1d6bceb69c165a6f5c.png)
	- **Name**: set a custom name. This document uses `cfs-test` as an example.
	- **Region*: select a region in which to create the file system and ensure that the file system and the cluster are in the same region.
	- **Availability Zone**: select an availability zone in which to create the file system.
	- **Storage Class**: select **Standard Storage** or **High-Performance Storage**. Different availability zones support different storage classes. For more information, see [Available Regions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/35772).
	- **File Service Protocol**: select a protocol type for the file system. Valid values include **NFS** and **CIFS/SMB**.
		- NFS: better suited to Linux and Unix clients.
		- CIFS/SMB: better suited to Windows clients. This protocol was launched for commercial use on September 1, 2020. For more information, see [Notes on Commercial Use of CIFS/SMB](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/582/9553).
	- **Client Type**: select the type of client that needs to access the file system. The value can be CVM (including TKE and BatchCompute) or CPM. Since CVM and CPM hosts belong to different networks, the system will allocate the file system to a specified network based on your client type.
	- **Network Type**: select **Virtual Private Cloud** so that CVM hosts can share the file system in a VPC.
	- **Select Network**: select a network to ensure that the file system and the cluster that uses the file system are in the same VPC.
	- **Permission Group**: each file system must be bound to a permission group. The permission group specifies an allowlist that can access the file system and lists the read and write permissions.
	- **Tag**:
		- If you have a tag, you can add it to the file system.
		- If you do not have a tag, log in to the [Tag console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tag/taglist) to create the required tag, and then bind the tag to the file system. You can also add a tag to the file system after the file system is created.
3. Click **Create** and wait until the file system is created.

<span id="getPath"></span>

### Obtaining the subdirectory of the file system
1. On the **File System** page, click the ID of the file system for which you want to obtain the destination subdirectory. The details page of the file system appears.
2. Select the **Mount Point Info** tab and obtain the subdirectory `/subfolder` of this file system from **Mount in Linux**, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/95d0f1765e7d78b218cd0715a2205cf1.png)
	- `localfolder`: indicates the local directory that you created.
	- `subfolder`: it indicates a subdirectory that you created in the CFS file system. The subdirectory of the file system is `/subfolder`.



## Directions

<span id="pv"></span>

### Creating a PV statically

>? A statically created PV is suitable for scenarios where file storage already contains data and is used in a cluster.
>
1. Log in to the TKE console and click **[Cluster](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/cluster)** in the left sidebar.
2. On the **Cluster Management** page, select the ID of the cluster where the PV needs to be created. The cluster management page of the PV to create appears.
3. Choose **Storage** > **PersistentVolume** in the left sidebar to go to the **PersistentVolume** page, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/ee6735e0929f99b807e88e6f39782cb0.png)
4. Click **Create** to go to the **Create PersistentVolume** page, where you can set PV parameters as required, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/362dedac094ce7efa1069f9b92d64ef9.png)
	- **Creation Method**: select **Static**.
	- **Name**: set a custom name. This document uses `cfs-pv` as an example.
	- **Provisioner**: select **Cloud File Storage**.
	- **R/W permission**: CFS only supports multi-server read and write.
	- **StorageClass**: select a StorageClass as required. This document uses `cfs-storageclass`, which you created in the step of [Creating a StorageClass via the console](#createStorageClass), as an example.
>? 
>- The PVC and PV will be bound to the same StorageClass.
>- If you do not specify a StorageClass, the value of `StorageClass` for the corresponding PV is empty, and the value of the `storageClassName` field in the corresponding YAML file is a null string.
	- **Select CFS**: ensure that the CFS and the current cluster are in the same VPC. This document uses `cfs-test`, which you created in the step of [Creating CFS](#createCFS), as an example.
	- **CFS Subfolder**: enter the file system subdirectory that you obtained in the step of [Obtaining the file system subdirectory](#getPath). This document uses `/subfolder` as an example.
5. Click **Create a PersistentVolume**.

<span id="createPVC2"></span>

### Creating a PVC
1. On the details page of the target cluster, choose **Storage** > **PersistentVolumeClaim** in the left sidebar to go to the **PersistentVolumeClaim** page, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/9fc201eafb0c1b17f912f704682f96ea.png)
2. Click **Create** to go to the **Create PersistentVolumeClaim** page, where you can set key PVC parameters as required, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/70fbd283c7d1dc95a707052cc59fda99.png)
   - **Name**: set a custom name. This document uses `cfs-pvc` as an example.
   - **Namespace**: select **default**.
   - **Provisioner**: select **Cloud File Storage**.
   - **R/W permission**: CFS only supports multi-server read and write.
   - **StorageClass**: select a StorageClass as required. This document uses `cfs-storageclass`, which you created in the step of [Creating a StorageClass via the console](#createStorageClass), as an example.
   >?
   >
   >- The PVC and PV will be bound to the same StorageClass.
>- If you do not specify a StorageClass, the value of `StorageClass` for the corresponding PVC is empty, and the value of the `storageClassName` field in the corresponding YAML file is a null string.
> 
   - **PersistVolume**: specify a PersistentVolume as required. This document uses the `cfs-pv` created in the [Creating a PV statically](#pv) step as an example.
>? 
>- Only PVs in the specified StorageClass and in the Available or Released statuses can be selected. If no PV in the current cluster meets the conditions, select **Do not specify** in **Specify PersistVolume**.
>- If the status of the selected PV is Released, you need to manually delete the `claimRef` field in the corresponding YAML configuration file of the PV so that the PV can be successfully bound with the PVC. For more information, see [PV and PVC Binding Rules](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/37770).
3. Click **Create a PersistentVolumeClaim** to complete the creation process.


### Creating a workload to use a PVC volume
>? This step creates a Deployment workload as an example.
>
1. On the **Cluster Management** page, select the target cluster ID to go to the **Deployment** page of the cluster for which the workload needs to be deployed.
2. Click **Create** to go to the **Create Workload** page. For more information on how to create a workload, see [Creating a Deployment](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457/30662). Then, mount a volume as required, as shown in the following figure.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3256845e7cdde23efd405c10f1f4ae92.png)
	- **Volume (optional)**:
		- **Mount method**: select **Use existing PVC**.
		- **Volume name**: set a custom name. This document uses `cfs-vol` as an example.
		- **Select PVC**: select `cfs-pvc`, which you created in the step of [Creating a PVC](#createPVC2).
	- **Containers in the pod**: click **Add Mount Point** to set a mount point.
       - **Volume**: select the volume `cfs-vol` that you added in this step.
       - **Destination Path**: enter a destination path. This document uses `/cache` as an example.
       - **Sub-path**: mount only a sub-path or a single file in the selected volume, such as `/data` or `/test.txt`.
3. Click **Create Workload** to complete the process.
 >! If you use the PVC mount method of CFS, the volume can be mounted to multiple nodes.
