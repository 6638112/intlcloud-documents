## Overview
Tencent Container Registry (TCR) is a container image cloud hosting service provided by Tencent Cloud. It has the following features:

**Security management**: TCR stores and distributes Docker images and Helm charts and supports image security scanning. It also provides enterprise users with fine-grained access permission management and network access control.
**Business expansion**: TCR supports worldwide synchronization and triggering of images, and meets enterprise users' requirements for using Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) workflows to expand their global businesses.
**Fast deployment**: TCR allows large-scale container clusters that contain over 1000 nodes to concurrently pull images of several gigabytes to ensure fast deployment of the container service.

With the TCR service, you can enjoy secure and efficient image hosting and distribution services in the cloud, without needing to build or maintain the image hosting service. In addition, you can use TCR together with [Tencent Kubernetes Engine](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/457) to smoothly deploy containers in the cloud.  


## Product Type
Both the TCR enterprise and personal editions are available.

#### Enterprise edition
TCR Enterprise Edition provides an enterprise-class, exclusive, and secure image hosting service. It is suitable for enterprise container users who have strict data security and compliance requirements, with businesses distributed across multiple regions and very large cluster scales. TCR supports the preceding features and is constantly updated. TCR Enterprise Edition currently supports pay-as-you-go billing. To purchase this product, go to [Tencent Container Registry](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/tcr).

#### Personal edition
TCR Personal Edition provides basic on-cloud image hosting and distribution services. It is applicable to R&D process testing of individual container users or enterprise users who do not have a large production scale, have a small cluster scale, and have less strict data security requirements. TCR Personal Edition is a shared service in the cloud. That is, all TCR Personal Edition users share the service backend and data storage, and quotas are imposed on image hosting, uploading, and downloading. TCR Personal Edition is free of charge. You can visit [Tencent Kubernetes Engine -> Tencent Container Registry](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tke2/registry) and start using it.
