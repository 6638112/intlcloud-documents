### What is a dedicated IP?
A dedicated IP is an IP specially assigned to you by Tencent Cloud for sending emails. Generally, it either has never been used to send emails or has a good reputation in the past. This ensures that it will not be marked as a spam IP by anti-spam organizations.

### Do I need to purchase a dedicated IP in order to use SES?
No. You can send emails via SES without a dedicated IP. Currently the dedicated IP feature is not available to users by default. If you have high requirements for sending emails and need a dedicated IP, contact your sales rep to apply for one.
