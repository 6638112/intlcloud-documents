>?After you set a callback address, Tencent Cloud will notify the callback address of successful delivery, email rejection, email bounce, email open, link click, unsubscription, and other events. By default, this field is left empty, indicating no notification.

2. Enter a callback address and click **Save** to complete the configuration.
