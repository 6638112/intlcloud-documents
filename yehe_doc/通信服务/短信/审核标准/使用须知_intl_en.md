We recommend you select an identity verification mode based on your actual account ownership.**

## Review Standards
An SMS message consists of a signature and a body. Before sending an SMS message, you need to create an SMS signature and an SMS body template.

| Component | Description | Review Standard |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Signature | An SMS signature must conform to its owner's attributes. You need to provide the corresponding qualification certificates when creating a signature, which can be used only after it is approved. | [Signature Review Standards](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/39022) |
| Body content | You must apply for an SMS body template for the SMS content in advance, which can be used only after it is approved. <br>The template allows you to use variables to customize the SMS content, and the message meaning and scenario must be identifiable through the text content (excluding variables). | [Body Template Review Standards](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40659) |

## Review Process
### Review duration
Generally, the review result will be returned in about 2 hours after you create an SMS signature or body template (review hours: 9:00â€“23:00 everyday).
If you urgently need to use the SMS feature, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category), and we will expedite the review.

### Review status description
- Pending review: you have submitted an SMS signature or body template, and it is waiting for review. The review result will be returned in about 2 hours.
- Approved: your SMS signature or body template has been approved. If both of them are approved, you can start sending SMS messages.
 An approved body template does not necessarily mean that messages will be successfully delivered (as ISPs also have sampling-based review mechanisms). If your SMS message fails to be sent, you can consult [SMS Helper](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/3773) for assistance.
- Rejected: your signature or body template is rejected for some reasons.
  You can log in to the [SMS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sms/smsSign/1400054957/0/10) console and click **View Failure Reason and Modify** next to the target signature or template to view the specific reason for rejection. You can also [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.

## Suspension Rules
We will review the SMS signature and body template you create and monitor and check the content of actually sent SMS messages to prevent any violation of applicable national laws and regulations.
If non-compliant SMS content is found, your account will be suspended, and your security deposit will be deducted, or you will be held liable according to the actual situation. After your account is suspended, you cannot continue to use the SMS service and cannot apply for reactivation in the future, and unused SMS service packages in your account cannot be used.
Please strictly comply with the requirements in [SMS Signature Specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40658) and [SMS Body Template Specifications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/40659), strengthen your business security, and send compliant SMS messages.
