You can set up auto-renewal on the [Package Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2/manage-package) page. After the auto-renewal feature is enabled, it will automatically renew the package whenever the auto-renewal condition is met, and the amount due for the number of renewed messages will be deducted from your account. For more information, please see Mainland China SMS Pricing Overview. Please top up your account in time to avoid renewal failure due to insufficient balance. Every time auto-renewal succeeds or fails, notifications will be sent to the creator of your Tencent Cloud account and all collaborators through email, SMS, and internal message.
