SDK 3.0 is a companion tool for the TencentCloud API 3.0 platform. You can use all [SMS APIs](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689) through the SDK. The new SDK version is unified and features the same SDK usage, API call methods, error codes, and returned packet formats for different programming languages.
>!
>- SMS sending APIs
>One message can be sent to up to 200 numbers at a time.
>- Signature and body template APIs
>Individual users have no permission to use signature and body template APIs and can [manage SMS signatures](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35456) and [SMS body templates](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35457) only in the SMS Console. To use the APIs, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".


## Prerequisites

- You have activated SMS. For detailed directions, please see [Getting Started with Mainland China SMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35449).
- If you need to send SMS messages in Mainland China, you need to purchase a Mainland China SMS package first.
- You have prepared the dependent environment: Node.js 7.10.1 or above.
- You have obtained the `SecretID` and `SecretKey` on the **[API Key Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi)** page in the CAM Console.
 - `SecretID` is used to identify the API caller.
 - `SecretKey` is used to encrypt the string to sign that can be verified on the server. **You should keep it private and avoid disclosure.**
- The call address of the SMS service is `sms.tencentcloudapi.com`.

## Relevant Documents
- For more information on the APIs and their parameters, please see [API Documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689).
- You can download the SDK source code [here](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs).

## Installing SDK
### Installing through npm (recommended)
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is a package management tool for Node.js.

1. Run the following installation command:
```
npm install tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs --save
```
2. Refer to the corresponding module code in your code. For more information, please see the [sample code](#example).

### Installing through source package
1. Go to the [GitHub code hosting page](https://github.com/tencentcloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs) or [quick download address](https://tencentcloud-sdk-1253896243.file.myqcloud.com/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs.zip) to download the source code package.
2. Decompress the source package to an appropriate location in your project.
3. Refer to the corresponding module code in your code. For more information, please see the [sample code](#example).

## Sample Code
>?All samples are for reference only and cannot be directly compiled and executed. You need to modify them based on your actual needs. You can also use [API 3.0 Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=sms&Version=2019-07-11&Action=SendSms) to automatically generate the demo code as needed.

Each API has a corresponding request structure and a response structure. This document only lists the sample code of several common features. For more samples, please see [SDK for Node.js Samples](https://github.com/TencentCloud/tencentcloud-sdk-nodejs/tree/master/examples/sms). 


### Applying for SMS template
```

// Import the client models of the SMS module
const smsClient = tencentcloud.sms.v20190711.Client;
const models = tencentcloud.sms.v20190711.Models;

const ClientProfile = tencentcloud.common.ClientProfile;
const HttpProfile = tencentcloud.common.HttpProfile;


/* Required steps:
 * Instantiate an authentication object. The Tencent Cloud account key pair `secretId` and `secretKey` need to be passed in as the input parameters
 * This example uses the way to read from the environment variable, so you need to set these two values in the environment variable in advance
 * You can also write the key pair directly into the code, but be careful not to copy, upload, or share the code to others
 * Query the CAM key: https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi
 */
//let cred = new Credential(process.env.TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_ID, process.env.TENCENTCLOUD_SECRET_KEY);

/* Optional steps:
 * Instantiate a client configuration object. You can specify the timeout period and other configuration items */
let httpProfile = new HttpProfile();
/* The SDK uses the POST method by default
 * If you need to use the GET method, you can set it here, but the GET method cannot handle some large requests */

/* The SDK has a default timeout period. Do not adjust it unless absolutely necessary
 * If needed, check in the code to get the latest default value */

/* The SDK automatically specifies the domain name. Generally, you don't need to specify a domain name, but if you are accessing a service in a finance AZ, you must manually specify the domain name
 * For example, the SMS domain name of the Shanghai Finance Zone is `sms.ap-shanghai-fsi.tencentcloudapi.com` *
 * Instantiate an SMS client object
 * The second parameter is the region information. You can directly enter the string `ap-guangzhou` or import the preset constant */
let client = new smsClient(cred, "ap-guangzhou", clientProfile);

/* Instantiate a request object. You can further set the request parameters according to the API called and actual conditions

 * An attribute may be of a basic type or import another data structure
 * You are recommended to use the IDE for development where you can easily redirect to and view the documentation of each API and data structure */

 * The SDK uses the pointer style to specify parameters, so even for basic parameters, you need to use pointers to assign values to them
