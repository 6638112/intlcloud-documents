### What should I do if a user does not receive an SMS message?
Log in to the [SMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2) and select **Statistics and Analytics** > **Mainland China SMS** (or **Global SMS**) > **Message Records** to view the **Delivery Status** and **Remarks** for the mobile number.
- If the **Delivery Status** is "failed", you can troubleshoot the issue based on the cause as described in **Remarks**. The cause may be that the request has hit the rate limit control policy, the SMS message format is incorrect, or the mobile number has been blocked due to unsubscription.
If the **Delivery Status** is "successful", but an error code is displayed in **Remarks**, please troubleshoot the issue based on the specific [error code](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34861).
- If the **Delivery Status** is "successful" and the **Remarks** display that "The user has successfully received the message", but the user actually has not received the message, you can troubleshoot the issue by following the steps below:
 - The mobile phone has been powered off or the mobile number has run out of credit or is out of service: check the status of the mobile phone/number, such as by dialing the number.
 - The mobile number is blocked: check whether the user has complained to the carrier or unsubscribed from the service.
 - The mobile phone cannot receive SMS messages because it has not been powered off for a long period of time: try restarting the mobile phone.
 - The mobile phone cannot receive SMS messages due to poor reception: check the reception and try restarting the mobile phone if necessary.
 - The mobile phone's SMS inbox is full: try deleting unwanted messages.
 - The mobile phone cannot receive SMS messages due to a settings or hardware issue: try changing the settings or removing the SIM card and inserting it into another mobile phone for testing (if the mobile phone is a dual SIM phone, try removing the SIM card and inserting it into the other card slot for testing).
 - The message has been blocked by the system/software in the mobile phone: check the blocklist.

If the problem persists, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### What should I do if it takes a long time to call an API?[](id:jump)
If you find that it takes a long time to call a Tencent Cloud SMS API, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. Run the `dig yun.tim.qq.com` command to check whether a private DNS is used, and if so, select a nearby Tencent Cloud SMS IP from the same carrier to configure the host and check whether the issue is fixed.
  - If the issue persists, the cause may be that the DNS resolution is stuck or there is a latency caused by cross-region or cross-carrier access. We recommend you use a DNS proxy or set up a public DNS server.
  - If the issue persists, please follow [step 2](#Q2step2).
2. Check which connection mode is used and whether a connection pool is used.[](id:Q2step2)
 - If a single persistent connection is used, according to the HTTP request/response model, if a request gets stuck, subsequent requests on the connection will be affected. The "persistent connection + connection pool" model is recommended.
 - If a non-persistent connection is used, run `netstat` to check whether the number of local connections has reached the upper limit, and if so, the "persistent connection + connection pool" model is recommended.
 - Run `netstat` to check or run `tcpdump` to capture packets to check whether there is a heap of connected Recv-Q and Send-Q, and if so, the "persistent connection + connection pool" model is recommended.
 - If no requests are sent over a connection for a long period of time (90 seconds), in order to prevent the intermediate network device from repossessing the connection, the requester is recommended to close the connection and establish a connection again when initiating a new request and there are not enough connections in the connection pool.

### Why does it take a long time for a user to receive an SMS message?

1. View the request sent time recorded in the local system and the SMS message sent time recorded in the console and calculate the difference between them.
 - If the difference is large (such as approximately or even more than 10 minutes), the cause may be that there is a delay in the API call. Please fix the issue by referring to [What should I do if it takes a long time to call an API?](#jump).
 - If the difference is small, please follow [step 2](#Q3step2).
2. Check the **Delivery Time** and **Status Report Time** for the SMS message and calculate the difference between them.[](id:Q3step2)
 - If the difference is large (such as more than 10 seconds for regular SMS or more than 5 minutes for marketing SMS), the cause may be that the SMS message is under review as it contains sensitive words, the mobile phone reception is poor, or the mobile number is in an exceptional state (for example, it has run out of credit or is out of service).
 - If the difference is small, the cause may be that the mobile phone reception is poor or the mobile phone is in an exceptional state (for example, it has been powered off).
3. If the issue persists, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.

### What is a mobile number blocklist?

Currently, there are blocklists in the following types:
- Unsubscribed user list. After an user replies "T", "N", "TD", "Unsubscribe", "QX", or "0000" (case-insensitive) to unsubscribe, the system will put the user's mobile number on the blocklist after receipt of the reply. When an SMS message is sent again, "Failed to send" will be returned, with remarks "1015 The mobile number is blocked", and the user will be unable to receive the message.
 You can log in to the [SMS console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2), select **General Management** > **Unsubscribed Users**, and submit an application for cancellation of the unsubscription, which will take effect upon approval.
- Carrier's blocklist. This type of users is blocked by the carrier for different reasons. When an SMS message is sent, "Sent successfully" will be returned, but the message may not be received by the user because it is blocked by the carrier's gateway or for other reasons.

### What should I do if error 1004 is returned?
When you call a Tencent Cloud SMS API to send an SMS message, if the response packet returns error 1004, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. Check whether the sent request is in standard JSON format. We recommend you search for a JSON format checker on the internet to identify the issue; for example, single quotation marks are used as double quotation marks by mistake, but double quotation marks should be used for standard JSON format.
2. Check whether the parameter names are correct.
3. Check whether the field types of the request are the same as those as described in the [API documentation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34689). For example, JSON strings and JSON integers are incorrectly used (e.g., `{"Name":"Tom", "Age":23}`, where "Name" should be a JSON string, while "Age" a JSON integer).
4. Check whether the field values of the request are within the value ranges as described in the API documentation. For example, the `international` field can only take a value of 0 or 1.
5. Check whether the API call is initiated as described in the API documentation. For example, when you call the API for sending bulk messages, you should not use the body for sending a message to a single recipient.
6. If the problem persists, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### What should I do if error 1014 is returned?
When you call a Tencent Cloud SMS API to send an SMS message, if the response packet returns error 1014, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. Check whether the content template applied for is correctly formatted. For example, the "{}" in the content template should be English brackets, and the numbers in the brackets should start from 1, i.e., {1}, {2}, and so on.
2. Check whether the template contains variable values, and if so, you need to pass in the variables when sending the message. If multiple variable values are set in the template, you also need to pass in multiple variables when sending the message.
3. Check whether the corresponding template has been approved.
4. Check whether the value of the `type` parameter in the request packet is the same as the type of the content template applied for (0 indicates regular SMS, while 1 indicates marketing SMS).
5. Check whether the request content is in the same format as the content template applied for. For example, **a mismatch may occur due to invisible characters such as spaces.**
6. If the content contains Chinese characters, please make sure that they need to be encoded in UTF-8.
7. A Mainland China SMS template can only be used for sending messages to mobile numbers in Mainland China, while a Global SMS template can only be used for sending messages to mobile numbers outside Mainland China.
8. If the problem persists, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### What should I do if error 1016 is returned?
When you call a Tencent Cloud SMS API to send an SMS message, if the response packet returns error 1016, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. Check whether the `AppID` and `AppKey` are correct.
2. Check whether the mobile number is in the correct format. **A correct mobile number should not contain spaces.**
3. Check whether the field names are correct.


### What should I do if error 60008 is returned?
When you call a Tencent Cloud SMS API to send an SMS message, if the response packet returns error 60008, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. If error code 60008 is returned within 1 second in response to the request, please check whether the request is in standard HTTP format.
2. Check whether the URL and body format of the request match the API.
3. Check whether the `Content-Type` of the request is the same as that of the body (`Content-Type: application/json;charset=utf-8` for SMS).
4. Check the DNS configuration to ensure that a public DNS server is used.
5. An HTTP persistent connection and a connection pool are recommended to improve network quality.
6. If the problem persists, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### What should I do if error 1001 (sig verification failed) is returned?
When you call a Tencent Cloud SMS API to send an SMS message, if the response packet returns error 1001, you can troubleshoot the issue in the following steps:
1. Check whether the random number generated by `sig` is the same as that in the URL.
2. Check whether the `SDK AppID` (starting with 1400) and `AppKey` in the code are correct.
3. Check whether the code used is the same as the sample code and the `sig` pseudo-code generated from the parameters is consistent.

### How do I get the SMS API SecretId and SecretKey?

### Can the recipient reply to a Tencent Cloud SMS message? Is there a time limit for doing so?
The recipient must reply within 72 hours, and the reply can be viewed.

### Can I view or receive user replies?
Yes, and no additional fees will be incurred by SMS replies. Replies can be viewed in the [Reply Records](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2/statistics-csms/record) section in the console or obtained by setting the callback address.

### What is the number used to send SMS messages after I activate Tencent Cloud SMS?
- For Mainland China SMS: the number contains 13–20 digits starting with 1069 and ending with a random number assigned by the carrier.
- For Global SMS: no numbers but only Qsms or Qcloud will be displayed.

### Can I send different SMS messages to different mobiles numbers at the same time?
You can send different SMS messages to different mobile numbers by calling the API for sending a message to a single recipient in multiple processes.

### What should I do if I cannot troubleshoot the issue that occurs while sending an SMS message?
You can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for assistance.

### The application has been approved, but an SMS message fails to be sent, and the record indicates that it contains sensitive words. Why?
The vocabulary of sensitive words is provided by the carrier. You can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) and provide the mobile number to which the message fails to be sent. A customer service agent will communicate with the carrier to fix the issue.

### Will each SMS message be reviewed after the SMS signature and body have been approved?
Individual users must obtain approval first before using the console to send SMS messages and are recommended to verify organizational identities.


### I sent an SMS message to a mobile number, but the message was not received, and the mobile number cannot be found in the console. What should I do?
- If the message was sent through the console, we recommend you check whether the mobile number in the sent file contains any extra characters, and if so, delete them.
- If the message was sent through the API, we recommend you check whether the request has been properly sent to Tencent Cloud and whether any response has been returned.


### Can I use a server outside Mainland China to send SMS messages?
A server outside Mainland China can be used to call an API to send SMS messages, and the domain name can be resolved nearby. You can use the `curl` API for testing first.

### Can I send bulk SMS?
Yes, you can send an SMS message to up to 200 mobile numbers at a time by calling the [SendSms API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/34859) or up to 100,000 mobile numbers through the console.

### Is number deduplication supported?
When you import numbers into the console, the platform will automatically deduplicate the batch of numbers with the same attributes.
In one SMS delivery request, the platform will check whether the recipient numbers of the same message content are duplicated and deliver the message only once for duplicated numbers.

### Are invoices available?
If you need an invoice, you can apply for it on the **[Invoice Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/expense/invoice)** page in the console.

### Why does the number contain asterisks when I preview an SMS message? For example, `Dear customer, your top-up payment of 1**2 USD has been credited to your account. Please check it in the system!`.
The console will encrypt numbers for storage, so numbers will contain asterisks when being previewed, but SMS messages received by users will be fully displayed.

### What are the country/region codes?
For more information on the country/region codes, please see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/8414).
