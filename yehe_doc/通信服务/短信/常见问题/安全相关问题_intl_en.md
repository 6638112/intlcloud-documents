### What is the default frequency limit for sending SMS messages?
To ensure business and channel security and minimize potential financial losses caused by malicious calls of SMS APIs, the default frequency limit for sending SMS messages is as detailed below:
- For SMS messages with the same content, a maximum of one such message can be sent to the same mobile number within 30 seconds.
- A maximum of 10 messages can be sent to the same mobile number on a calendar day.

Organizational users can log in to the [SMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2) to set or modify the corresponding frequency limit policy. For detailed directions, please see [Setting Sending Frequency Limit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469#.E8.AE.BE.E7.BD.AE.E5.8F.91.E9.80.81.E9.A2.91.E7.8E.87.E9.99.90.E5.88.B6).
Note: individual users have no permission to modify the frequency limit. To use this feature, change "Individual Identity" to "Organizational Identity".

### How do I prevent SMS bombing?
SMS bombing is an attack where the attacker exploits web client or server vulnerabilities to send a large number of verification code SMS messages to many irrelevant mobile numbers in a short period of time (such as within one day) by using malicious programs or tools. Such attacks harass mobile phone users severely.
Below is an actual case encountered by a customer (in normal cases, dozens of SMS messages are delivered every day, while tens of thousands of messages are delivered every day during the bombing):

SMS bombing not only makes the SMS channel unavailable due to high numbers of complaints made by harassed users, but also causes serious financial losses for the business. Therefore, you need to take preventive measures.
As SMS bombing is usually initiated by servers, you are recommended to take the following measures for prevention:

- Add CAPTCHA. Tencent Cloud provides the Tianyu anti-cheating feature.
- Limit the number of requests for a single IP.
- Limit the number of messages sent to a single mobile number. You can [set the sending frequency limit](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469#.E8.AE.BE.E7.BD.AE.E5.8F.91.E9.80.81.E9.A2.91.E7.8E.87.E9.99.90.E5.88.B6) and [configure alarm contacts](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/32356).
- [Set an excessive messaging reminder](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/382/35469#.E8.AE.BE.E7.BD.AE.E5.8F.91.E9.80.81.E8.B6.85.E9.87.8F.E6.8F.90.E9.86.92).
- Log in to the [SMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/smsv2) to view the specific statistics and check the SMS message delivery conditions regularly (such as once a day). If there is any exception, fix it timely. In case of emergency, you can deactivate the SMS service in the console.

### What are the differences between sending Mainland China/Global SMS messages?
As required by carriers, Mainland China SMS messages must carry an SMS signature; for global SMS messages, SMS signature is optional, and you can choose whether to carry a signature as needed.
- Before sending a Mainland China SMS message, you should first create a signature and a body template, which need to be reviewed and approved.
- Before sending a global SMS message, you should first create a body template, which needs to be reviewed and approved. If you want to carry a signature in the messages, you should create it and have it reviewed and approved; otherwise, you do not need to create a signature.
