### Group Features
IM configures the following default group types based on common use cases:
- Work group: is similar to an ordinary WeChat group. After a work group is created, only a group member can invite other users to join this group, and the invitation does not need to be approved by the invitee or group owner.
- Public group: is similar to a QQ group. After a public group is created, the group owner can specify a group admin. When a user searches the group ID and applies to join the group, the application must be approved by the group owner or admin before the user can join the group.
- Meeting group: after a meeting group is created, a user can join and exit the group as desired, and view messages sent before the user joins the group. This group type is suitable for scenarios where Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC) is used, for example, audio-and-video conferencing and online education.
- Audio-and-video chat room (AVChatRoom): after an AVChatRoom group is created, a user can join and exit the group as desired. This group type does not limit the number of members, but it does not support the storage of historical messages. It can be used together with Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) to support on-screen comments.

The following table lists the differences between the default features of each group type:
