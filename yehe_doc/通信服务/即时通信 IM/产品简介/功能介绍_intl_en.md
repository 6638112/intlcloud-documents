### Group Features
Based on common use cases, IM has set the following default group types:
- A work group for friends (Work) is like an ordinary WeChat group. After a work group is created, a user can only join the group by being invited by a friend who is a member of the group. The invitation does not need to be accepted by the invitee or approved by the group owner.
- A social networking group for strangers (Public) is like a QQ group. After a public group is created, the group owner can designate group admins. To join the group, a user needs to search for the group ID and send an application, and the application needs to be approved by the group owner or an admin before the user can join the group.
- A temporary meeting group (Meeting) allows users to join and exit freely and supports viewing message history from before the user joined the group. Meeting groups are ideal for scenarios that integrate Tencent Real-Time Communication (TRTC), such as audio and video conferences and online education.
- An audio-video group (AVChatRoom) allows users to join and exit freely, supports an unlimited number of members, and does not store message history. Audio-video groups can be used with Live Video Broadcasting (LVB) to support on-screen comment chat scenarios.

The following table compares the default features of each group type:
