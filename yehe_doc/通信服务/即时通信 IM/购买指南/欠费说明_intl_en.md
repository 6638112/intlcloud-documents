If your prepaid IM standard billing plan has expired for over 7 days (excluding the day of the expiration date) or your Tencent Cloud account has been in arrears for over 7 days (including the day on which the bill was pushed to you) after the bill was generated, the service will be suspended. For customers whose services have been suspended for an extended period of time, their resources will be repossessed and **cannot be recovered**.

## Service Suspension Policies
### Accounts in arrears
The postpaid bill for using related resources will be pushed to your account on the first to third day of the next month. At that point, your account is in arrears if your Tencent Cloud account does not have a sufficient balance to pay the bill or your balance is below zero. If your Tencent Cloud account has been in arrears for over 7 days (including the day on which the bill was pushed to you) after the bill was pushed to you, the service will be suspended. You will not be able to continue using any Tencent Cloud services after the suspension.

## Resource Repossession
After the service suspension, your SDKAppID resources will be retained for 90 days (including the day on which the service was suspended). If you fail to top up your account in 90 days, your resources will be repossessed and **cannot be recovered**.
