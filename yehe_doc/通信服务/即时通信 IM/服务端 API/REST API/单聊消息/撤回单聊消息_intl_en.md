## Feature Description
- This API enables administrators to recall one-to-one messages.
- This API can recall all one-to-one messages, including those sent by clients or by the [v4/openim/sendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) and [v4/openim/batchsendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920) RESTful APIs.
- To recall one-to-one messages sent by clients, you can enable the [C2C.CallbackBeforeSendMsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34364) or [C2C.CallbackAfterSendMsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34365) callback API. Record the `MsgKey` of each one-to-one message via the callback API, and enter it in the `MsgKey` field of this API to recall the message. You can also use the [v4/openim/admin_getroammsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35478) API to query the `MsgKey` of the one-to-one message to be recalled, and enter it in the `MsgKey` field of this API to recall the message.
- The `MsgKey` field in the responses to the [v4/openim/sendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) and [v4/openim/batchsendmsg](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920) API calls is required to recall the one-to-one messages sent via these two APIs.
- Once a one-to-one message is recalled by this API, it is recalled from offline storage, roaming storage, and the local cache of the sender’s and recipient’s clients.
- This API can recall one-to-one messages sent at any time. There’s no time limit.

>!Please note that one-to-one messages recalled by this API cannot be restored.
