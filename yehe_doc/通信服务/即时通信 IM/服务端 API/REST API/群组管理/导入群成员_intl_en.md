## Feature Description
- This API is used to import group members without triggering callbacks or delivering notifications.
- When your app needs to be migrated to IM from another instant messaging system, you can use this protocol to import existing group member data.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type | Support This RESTful API |
|-----------|------------|
|Private|Yes, identical to Work in the new version|
|Public|Yes|
|ChatRoom|Yes, identical to Meeting in the new version|
|AVChatRoom|No|

IM comes with the preceding four group types. For more information, see [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

> Generally, importing group members is not required for AVChatRoom, so AVChatRoom does not support this API. If you attempt to use API on AVChatRoom, error 10007 will be returned.

### Request URL example
```
https://console.tim.qq.com/v4/group_open_http_svc/import_group_member?sdkappid=88888888&identifier=admin&usersig=xxx&random=99999999&contenttype=json
```

The following table lists only the parameters to be modified when this API is called. For details on other parameters, see [RESTful API Overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34620).

| Parameter | Description |

| v4/group_open_http_svc/import_group_member | Request API |
| sdkappid | SDKAppID assigned by the IM console when an app is created |
| identifier | This must be the app admin account. For details, see [App Admins](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33517). |
| usersig | Signature generated by the app admin account. For details, see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385). |

### Maximum calling frequency

The maximum calling frequency is 200 times per second.

### Request packet example

Request packets are used to import group members. A single request supports the import of a maximum of 500 members. If the unread message count specified by this API is greater than the current number of messages of the group, the unread message count is set to the current number of messages of the group.
> Ensure that the join time of the member to be imported is later than the group creation time and earlier than the current time. Otherwise, the member cannot be imported.

```
{
    "GroupId": "@TGS#2J4SZEAEL", // Target group (required)
    "MemberList": [ // A maximum of 500 members can be added at a time.
    {
        "Member_Account": "tommy" // ID of the group member to be added (required)
        "Role":"Admin", // Role of the group member to be imported. Currently, the only supported role is Admin (optional).
        "JoinTime":1448357837, // Time when the group member to be imported joined the group (optional)
        "UnreadMsgNum":5 // Unread message count of this member (optional)

    },
    {
        "Member_Account": "jared",
        "JoinTime":1448357857,
        "UnreadMsgNum":2
    }]
}
```

### Request packet fields

| Field | Type | Property | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| GroupId | String | Required | ID of the target group |
| MemberList | Array | Required | Array of the group members to be added |
| Member_Account | String | Required | Group member accounts to be imported |
| Role | String | Optional | Role of the group member to be imported. Currently, only Admin is supported. If this field is not specified, the member is regarded as a common member. |
| JoinTime | Integer | Optional | Time when the group member to be imported joined the group |
| UnreadMsgNum | Integer | Optional | Unread message count of the group member to be imported |

### Response packet example

```
{
    "ActionStatus": "OK",
    "ErrorInfo": "",
    "ErrorCode": 0,
    "MemberList": [
    {
         "Member_Account": "tommy",
         "Result": 1 // Result of the import. 0: failed. 1: succeeded. 2: already a group member.
    },
    {
         "Member_Account": "jared",
         "Result": 1
    }]
}
```

### Response packet fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---------|---------|---------|
| ActionStatus | String | Request processing result. OK: succeeded. FAIL: failed. |
| ErrorCode | Integer | Error code. 0: succeeded. Others: failed. |
| ErrorInfo | String | Error information |
| MemberList | Array | List of added group members |
| Member_Account | String | Returned group member accounts |
| Result | Integer | Result of the import. 0: failed. 1: succeeded. 2: already a group member. |

## Error Codes

Unless a network error (such as error 502) occurs, the HTTP return code of this API is always 200. The actual error code and error information are represented by ErrorCode and ErrorInfo in the response packet, respectively.
For common error codes (60000 to 79999), see [Error Codes](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34348).
The private error codes for this API are as follows:

| Error Code | Description |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 10002 | An internal server error occurred. To correct it, try again. |
| 10003 | The request command word is invalid. |
| 10004 | A request parameters is invalid. To correct it, check whether request parameters are correct based on the error description. |
| 10005 | The request packet carries too many accounts. |
| 10006 | The operation frequency limit has been reached. To correct it, reduce the frequency of calls. |
| 10007 | The user does not have sufficient operation permissions. For example, a common member in a public group attempts to remove a member from the group, but only the app admin has the permission to do so. |
| 10010 | The group does not exist or has been dismissed. |
| 10015 | The group ID is invalid. To correct it, check whether the group ID is correct. |
