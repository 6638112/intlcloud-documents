## Feature Description
This API is used to delete messages sent by a specified user within the last 1,000 messages.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | Is this RESTful API Supported? |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group for friends) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No. |

These are the 4 built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>Livestreaming groups (AVChatRoom groups) do not support storing message history (in this document, deleting messages means deleting messages stored in the message history). Therefore, you cannot delete user messages in groups of this type. However, no error will be returned if you attempt to do so.
