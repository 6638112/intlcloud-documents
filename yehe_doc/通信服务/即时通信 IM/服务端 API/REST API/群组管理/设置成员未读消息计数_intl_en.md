## Feature Description
-  This API is used by app admins to set the unread message count of a group member. When this API is called, no callback is triggered and no notification is sent.
-  When the app needs to be migrated from another IM system to Tencent Cloud IM, this API is used to set the unread message count of group members.

## API Calling Description
### Applicable group types

| Group Type ID | Is this RESTful API Supported? |
|-----------|------------|
| Private | Yes. Same as Work (work group for friends) in the new version. |
| Public | Yes. |
| ChatRoom | Yes. Same as Meeting (temporary meeting group) in the new version. |
| AVChatRoom | No. |

These are the 4 built-in group types in IM. For detailed information, see the [Group System](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33529).

>ChatRooms and AVChatrooms do not support unread message counts. Therefore, you cannot set an unread message count for members of these two group types. However, no error will be returned if you try.
