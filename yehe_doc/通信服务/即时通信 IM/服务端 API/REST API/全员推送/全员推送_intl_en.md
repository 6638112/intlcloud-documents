## Feature Description
- This API can push messages to all users.
- This API can push messages by user attribute.
- This API can push messages by user tag.
- When the admin pushes messages, the message sender displayed to the recipients is the admin.
- When the admin specifies an account to push messages to other accounts, the sender displayed to the recipients is not the admin but the account specified by the admin.
- This API supports offline storage of messages, but does not support message roaming.
- It takes time to push messages to all users. The actually required time depends on the number of accounts. Typically, it is within 1 minute.
