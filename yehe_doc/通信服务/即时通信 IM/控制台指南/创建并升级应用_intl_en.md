## Introduction
This article describes how to create Trial Edition apps and obtain SDKAppIDs. It also covers how to upgrade Trial Edition apps to Pro Edition apps using the IM console.

## Prerequisites
You have [signed up](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985) for a Tencent Cloud account and completed [identity verification](http://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Creating a Trial App
1. Log in to the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im).
2. Click **Add Application**.
3. In the **Create Application** dialog box, enter an app name and click **OK**.
    After the app is created, you can view the status, service version, SDKAppID, creation time, and expiration time of the new app on the overview page of the console.
  > By default, a new app is a trial app and enabled.
  > A Tencent Cloud account can create a maximum of 100 IM apps. If you want to create more apps, [disable and delete](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34540) an unwanted app. **Once an app (along with its SDKAppID) is deleted, the service it provides and all its data are lost**. **Proceed with caution**.
