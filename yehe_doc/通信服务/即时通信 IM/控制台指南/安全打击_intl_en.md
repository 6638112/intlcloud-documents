## Feature Overview

Content filtering uses natural language processing (NLP) technologies to determine whether user profiles, group profiles, one-to-one chat text messages, and group chat text messages in the IM system comply with regulations. This ensures automatic and intelligent message review, significantly reduces labor costs for content review, and enhances the product experience.
>! Currently, content filtering does not support passed-through custom messages.

## Custom Message Filtering
To provide custom message filtering, IM needs to use a third-party content filtering service.

The following figure shows the detailed process of custom message filtering. First, the IM SDK sends a message to the IM backend. The IM backend then calls a callback ([Invoke a Callback Before Sending One-to-One Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34364) or [Invoke a Callback Before Delivering Group Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34374)) before sending the message to the third-party content filtering service. Second, the business backend copies the content of the message to the third-party content filtering service. After the third-party content filtering service returns the content filtering result, the business backend forwards the result to the IM backend. Lastly, the IM backend determines whether to deliver the message.
