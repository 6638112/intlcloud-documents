### Obtaining a key
**Keys are sensitive information, so be sure to keep it confidential and prevent it from being leaked.** By default, apps (SDKAppIDs) created before August 15, 2019 use the [ECDSA-SHA256](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385) signature algorithm that uses a public key and a private key.

    The key can be used to generate UserSig. For more information, see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385).

Account administrators can call RESTful APIs, disband groups, and perform operations on all members. You can use the default `administrator` or manually add account administrators.  Each application can have 5 account administrators.
