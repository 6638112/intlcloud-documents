To integrate the IM SDK in your app, simply complete the following three steps:

## Step 1: Try the Demo

Scan the QR code to [download and try out the demo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34279).
For details on how to use the IM SDK, see [Quick Demo Operation](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34553).

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK
TUIKit is a UI component layer that encapsulates the IM SDK and contains common IM components such as the chat panel, conversation list, and contacts.
- To quickly integrate and use the SDK, see [the fast integration method here (including the UI library)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34286).
- To use SDK APIs to customize UIs, see the [general integration method here (no UI library)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34306).

## Step 3: Integrate the RESTful API on the Server End
The IM service provides server-end RESTful APIs that allow the app service backend to manage server-end services, such as IM service user accounts, one-to-one chat messages, group chat messages, group management, user profiles, friend relationship chains, operational data, historical message download, and third-party callback.
For details on server integration operations, see the [server API document](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34621).

## Step 4: (Optional) Integrate Video Calling
The IM service can quickly integrate [Tencent Real-Time Communication] (https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/35076) to provide services such as user video chats and group video conferencing in IM applications. Currently, only iOS supports this feature.
