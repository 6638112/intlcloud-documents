The live e-commerce broadcasting component results from the secondary encapsulation of Instant Messaging (IM) capabilities used in the live streaming scenario. Capabilities, such as likes, gifts, product push, and coupon claiming, are encapsulated specifically for the live streaming scenario. For how to download the related SDK, see [Downloading the SDK](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33996).



## Prerequisites for Using the Component

- **You have created an IM app**.
- **The following group custom field is created**.
  - attent: records the hosts that you have followed.
- **You have created the following group member custom fields**.
  - add_goods: lists newly released products on the backend in the live room.
  - room_status: controls the status of the live room.

## SDK Integration
- Run the following command to integrate the IM SDK.
```
npm i tim-js-sdk --save
```
- Run the following command to integrate the livestream marketing SDK.
```
npm i im-live-sells --save
```

## Component Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SDKAppID | ID of the IM app. The SDKAppID should be created in the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im). By default, new apps are Trial Edition apps, which are mainly used for integration and testing. We recommend that you upgrade to Pro Edition or Flagship Edition before launching your app. |
| userSig | UserSig of the IM user. This parameter is required for logging in to the IM SDK. A UserSig can be generated at the business backend and then sent to the frontend for use. For more information on the methods and code for generating a UserSig, see [Generating UserSig](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34385). |
| roomID | ID of the live room. It indicates the ID of the livestreaming group (AVChatRoom group) created in IM. A livestreaming group supports an unlimited number of members and can be created in the [IM console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/im-detail/qun-manage) or through the [RESTful API](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34620). |
| TIM | IM SDK. You need to use **tim-wx-sdk* in a Mini Program environment and **tim-js-sdk** in a web environment. |
| userName | This parameter is consistent with the userName of the generated UserSig. |



## Initialization Example

```javascript
import TLS from 'im-live-sells'
import TIM from 'tim-js-sdk' // Web environment
import TIM from 'tim-wx-sdk' // Mini Program environment
const tls = new TIMLiveSell({
      SDKAppID: 1400***803,
      roomID: '@TGS#E****NVLGE',
      userSig: 'eJwtzM9****-reWMQw_',
      userName: 'Ho***st',
      TIM: TIM
})
```

## Component Callbacks

### TLS.EVENT.SDK_READY

This callback is triggered when the initialization of the component is completed. This event corresponds to `TIM.EVENT.SDK_READY` of the IM SDK. You can call the SDK methods only after this callback is triggered.

```javascript
tls.on(TLS.EVENT.SDK_READY, async() => {
  
})
```
