This document describes how to quickly integrate the Tencent Cloud IM SDK (iOS) to your projects. To configure and integrate the SDK, follow these steps.

## Environment Requirements
- Xcode 9.0+.
- iPhone or iPad on iOS 8.0 or above.
- Your project has a valid developer signature.

## Integrating the IM SDK
You can either automatically integrate the IM SDK using CocoaPods, or manually download the [SDK](https://github.com/tencentyun/TIMSDK/tree/master/iOS/ImSDK) and import it to your current project.

### Automatic loading using CocoaPods
#### 1. Install CocoaPods
Enter the following command in the terminal window (you need to install the Ruby environment on your macOS in advance):
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

#### 2. Create a Podfile
Go to the path where the project is located and run the following command. Then, a Podfile will appear under the project path.
```
pod init
```

#### 3. Edit the Podfile
If you are using the SDK basic edition, edit the Podfile as follows:

```
platform :ios, '8.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'App' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_iOS'
end
```

If you are using the SDK enhanced edition, edit the Podfile as follows:
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'App' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS'
end
```

If you are using the SDK bitcode enhanced edition, edit the Podfile as follows:
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'App' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS_Bitcode'
end
```

If you are using the SDK XCFramework enhanced edition, edit the Podfile as follows:
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'App' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS_XCFramework'
end
```

If you are using the SDK XCFramework enhanced edition (bitcode supported), edit the Podfile as follows:
```
platform :ios, '8.0'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

target 'App' do
pod 'TXIMSDK_Plus_iOS_Bitcode_XCFramework'
end
```

#### 4. Install the SDK or update the local repository.
Run the following command in the terminal window to update the local library file and install the TXIMSDK:
```
pod install
```
Or, run the following command to update the local repository:
```
pod update
```

After the pod command is executed, an .xcworkspace project file integrated with the SDK will be generated. Double-click this file to open it.
>?If the pod search fails, you are advised to update the local repo cache of the pod by running the following commands:
>```
>pod setup
>pod repo update
>rm ~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods/search_index.json
>```


### Manual integration
#### 1. Download the SDK
Download the latest SDK version from [GitHub](https://github.com/tencentyun/TIMSDK/tree/master/iOS/ImSDK):

- `ImSDK.framework` and `ImSDK_Plus.framework` are the core dynamic library files of the IM SDK.

- TXLiteAVSDK_UGC.framework is the Tencent Cloud UGSV SDK that implements short-video sending and receiving in IM. It is an optional component.

#### 2. Create a project
**Create a project.**

**Enter a project name, for example, IMDemo.**

#### 3. Integrate the IM SDK

**Add the dependency library**: select **Target** for IMDemo. On the **General** panel, add the dependency library under **Embedded Binaries** and **Linked Frameworks and Libraries**. If you use the SDK basic edition, select **ImSDK.framework**. If you use the SDK enhanced edition, select **ImSDK_Plus.framework**.

**Set link parameters: add `-ObjC` in **Build Setting** -> **Other Linker Flags**.
>?For manual integration, you need to change `ImSDK.framework` to `Embed&Sing` in **Target** -> **General** -> **Frameworks** -> **Libraries and Embedded Content**.

## Referencing the IM SDK
There are two ways to use the SDK in your project code.

#### Method 1
Choose **Xcode** -> **Build Setting** -> **Header Search Paths**, and set the SDK header file path. In files that require the SDK API, reference the corresponding header file.

- If you use the SDK basic edition, reference the header file as follows:
```
#import "ImSDK.h"
```
- If you use the SDK enhanced edition, reference the header file as follows:
```
#import "ImSDK_Plus.h"
```

#### Method 2

In files that require the SDK API, reference the corresponding header file.
- If you use the SDK basic edition, reference the header file as follows:
```
#import <ImSDK/ImSDK.h>
```
- If you use the SDK enhanced edition, reference the header file as follows:
```
#import <ImSDK_Plus/ImSDK_Plus.h>
```
