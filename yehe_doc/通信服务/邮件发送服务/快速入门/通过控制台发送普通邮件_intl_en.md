## Sending Regular Email in Console
The easiest way to send emails with DMS is to use the console. As the console requires you to enter the information manually, it is generally suitable for sending test emails only. After you start using DMS formally, you are likely to use APIs to send emails, but the console can help you manage and monitor your delivery activities.

After preparing for emailing, you can send your first test email in the following steps:
1. Log in to the [DMS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dms).
2. Click **Emailing** on the left sidebar to enter the **Emailing** page.
3. Click **Send Email** to enter the email content editing page and enter or upload the task name, recipient address, sender address, sender name, return address, and email content.
4. After confirming that everything is correct, click **OK**.

A new regular emailing task will be created in the email task list. After the email is sent, you can view the total number of task requests and number of successful tasks and go to the corresponding email address to check for the test email. You can also **send a template email** in similar steps.
