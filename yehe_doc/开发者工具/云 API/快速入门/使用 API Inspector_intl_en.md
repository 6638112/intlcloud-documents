API Inspector is a new feature of TencentCloud API. It enables you to view the API calls associated with console operations. In addition, it can automatically generate API code snippets in different languages and work withe API Explorer for online debugging. 

>!
>- API Inspector displays only open [TencentCloud API 3.0](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/api) calls.
> - API Inspector is currently in beta for both the console and users.
> For the CVM console, this feature is currently available only in the menus of [instance](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/instance/index?rid=1), [CDH](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/cdh), [placement group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/ps), [AS](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/autoscaling/group), [SSH key](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/sshkey), and [recycle bin](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/recycler/cvm?rid=1).
> - Refreshing your current page in the browser will remove previous call records.

## Benefits

API Inspector and API Explorer together offer an integrated solution for TencentCloud API users to learn and debug APIs, with the following features:
- **Automatic recording**: if you want to understand the APIs behind a specific feature, you can use API Inspector to get the call information of related APIs when using the feature in the console. For more information, please see [Automatic API call recording](#AutomaticRecordingAPI).                         
- **Code generation**: API Inspector can automatically generate API code snippets in various languages with prepopulated parameters, which you can run directly. For more information, please see [Quick API code generation](#AutomaticGeneratedAPI).                         
- **Online debugging**: API Inspector comes with API Explorerâ€™s quick online debugging feature, and can perform various tasks such as automatic multilingual SDK code generation, online call capacity, sending real requests, and automatic signature string generation, making the SDKs easier to use. For more information, please see [API Explorer online debugging](#APIExplorer).

### Automatic API call recording
This document will use renaming an instance as an example to describe the automatic recording feature of API Inspector:
1. Rename an instance to "API Inspector". For detailed directions, please see [Renaming Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/16562).
2. Enable the API Inspector feature to view all API calls involved in the renaming operation.
