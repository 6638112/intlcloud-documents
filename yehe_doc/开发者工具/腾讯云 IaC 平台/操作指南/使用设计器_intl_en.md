## Directions


1. Log in to the [TIC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tic).
2. In the left sidebar, choose **Orchestration** -> **Designer**.
3. On the **Designer** page, enter a name, description and related code. Currently, TIC Designer only supports code compiling. It supports the multi-file structure and file uploads as well as downloads. You can easily switch between on-premise and cloud-based code compilation.
