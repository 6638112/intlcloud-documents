2. In the left sidebar, choose **Orchestration** -> **Designer**.
3. On the **Designer** page that appears, enter a name, a description, and related code. Currently, the TIC Designer supports code compiling only. It supports multi-file structure, and allows file uploads and downloads. You can easily switch between on-premises and cloud-based code compilation.
