## Quickly Creating Tencent Cloud Infrastructures

TIC is an ideal choice if you need to quickly create multiple identical infrastructures, for example, creating identical infrastructures in different regions or creating a cross-region disaster recovery system. TIC relieves you of repeated click operations in the console, saves the cost of learning API usage, and avoids the risk of misoperations. You only need to specify a region, select an existing template, modify the required parameters, and submit all the settings to create infrastructures.
