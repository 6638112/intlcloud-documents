## Quickly creating Tencent Cloud infrastructures

If you need to quickly create multiple identical infrastructures, such as creating the same infrastructure in different regions or enabling cross-region disaster recovery, TIC is an ideal choice. It helps you avoid repeated operations in the console, reduces the cost of learning API usage, and lowers the risk of misoperations. You only need to specify a region, select an existing template, modify required parameters, and submit configurations to create corresponding infrastructures.
