This document describes tenant security features such as MAR, auto failover, and data security encryption.

## Multi-thread Async Replication (MAR)
#### Background
As a database records data in it, to switch between multiple databases, the data in them must be in sync. Therefore, data sync is the foundation of the database high availability solution. Generally, data can be synced in the following process:

Currently, the open-source MySQL database supports the async and semi-sync data replication modes. However, in both modes, if a node failure occurs, the data may be lost or become incorrect or messy. In addition, the replication mode is serial, which has a low performance.

#### Solution
In Tencent Cloud's proprietary parallel multi-thread asynchronous replication (MAR, aka strong sync) solution based on the MySQL protocol, when a request is initiated at the application layer, only after a replica node successfully returns a message can the primary node respond to the application layer with a request success, ensuring that the primary and the replica nodes have the same exact data.

When you perform strong sync replication, the primary database will be hanged if it is disconnected from the replica database or if the replica database fails. If there is only one primary or replica database, the high-availability solution will be unavailable, because if only one single server is used, part of the data will be lost completely when a failure occurs, which does not meet the requirements for finance-level data security.
Therefore, based on MAR, MariaDB provides a downgradable strong sync solution, which is similar to the semi-sync technology of Google but has a different implementation solution.
In addition, MariaDB MAR parallelizes the serial sync threads and introduces the worker thread capabilities, which greatly improve the performance. In the same cross-AZ (IDC with a latency of around 10–20 ms) test, the technical performance of MAR is around 5 times that of semi-sync replication on MySQL 5.6 and 1.5 times that of MariaDB Galera Cluster. In OLTP RW (mix read/write in primary/replica architecture), its performance is 1.2 times that of async replication on MySQL 5.7. The comparison of the specific performance tested by the Intel® technical team is as shown below:

## Auto Failover and Recovery
In production systems, high availability solutions are often required to ensure uninterrupted system operations. As the core of system data storage and services, the availability requirement for the database is higher than that for computing service resources.

The high availability solution of MariaDB works by allowing the collaboration of multiple database services. In this way, if a database fails, another server will immediately take over its tasks, so the service will not be interrupted or be interrupted only for a very short period of time. This solution is also called primary/replica high availability.

Based on the general primary/replica high availability, MariaDB further supports the following advanced features:
- Auto failover, cluster member control, and node removal from the cluster are supported. For instance-level primary-replica switches, the virtual IP (VIP) will remain unchanged. The MAR policy ensures complete primary/replica data consistency in case of primary/replica failover, fully meeting the finance-level requirements for data consistency.
- Auto recovery is supported. When a physical node carrying shards fails, the scheduling system will automatically try to recover the node. If the node cannot be recovered, it will be automatically replaced within 30 minutes. A new node will be rebuilt from backups and automatically added to the cluster, ensuring the high-availability architecture of instances for the long term.
- Each node contains a complete replica of the data and can be switched according to the needs specified on the database management page.
- Do-not-switch configuration is supported. That is, failover will not be performed during the specified period of time.
- x86 PCs are supported, and there is no need to share storage devices.
- Cross-AZ deployment is supported. Even if the primary and replica instances are in different data centers (regardless of whether they are in the same region), the data can be replicated through Direct Connect in real time. If the local node is the primary and the remote node is the replica, the local node will be accessed first, and if it fails or becomes unreachable, the remote node will be accessed. In addition, with the help of Tencent Cloud VPC, an intra-region active-active architecture can be implemented. That is, the business system can directly read/write the database in both data centers.
This feature provides MariaDB with multi-AZ disaster recovery capabilities, eliminating the operational risks with single-IDC deployment.

All MariaDB shards support the MAR-based high availability solution. If the primary database fails, the system will automatically select the optimal replica database immediately to take over the tasks. The switch process is imperceptible to users, the access IP remains unchanged, and 24/7 continuous monitoring is provided for the databases and underlying physical devices.
If a failure occurs, the system will automatically restart the database and relevant processes. If a node crashes and cannot be recovered, it will be automatically rebuilt from its backup files, as shown below:

## Data Security Encryption
MariaDB supports tablespace encryption (transparent encryption) and connection encryption (SSL connection encryption). In scenarios where Tencent Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) is not utilized, MariaDB supports the keyring service, enabling internal server components and plugins to securely store sensitive data for subsequent retrieval. This service provides a set of APIs for the encryption feature to call KMS.


## SQL Firewall
SQL firewall is a security feature that filters out unauthorized SQL statements by analyzing the syntax of SQL statements sent by users. It works with SQL Engine to check whether an SQL statement is on the predefined list of unauthorized SQL statements so as to filter out and block it accordingly, which effectively prevents SQL injection attacks.

>?SQL firewall can be used together with Tencent Cloud services such as Web Application Firewall (WAF). Taking into account the business conditions and SQL complexity, there are currently no preset rules in the MariaDB SQL firewall.

## Comprehensive Security Audit
Security audit is one of the most important tracing methods. Therefore, China's Cybersecurity Classified Protection Certification (Level 3) stipulates that an information system should support auditing. MariaDB provides audit capabilities at the following three layers to deliver complete security protection:
- Security audit for the OPS system, which is implemented by the operation logs of the Chitu operation system.
- Security audit for the database system, which is implemented by Tencent Cloud's proprietary database audit system.
- Security audit for the server operating system, which is implemented by Tencent Cloud's proprietary Tiejiangjun system.
>?
>- In public cloud, all security audit features are configured by default.
>- In private cloud, system operation logging (Chitu system) is configured by default, while database SQL audit and server operation audit features are optional.

## Kernel-Level Security Policies
MariaDB provides various open-source security solutions at the database kernel level, some of which have earned the recognition of the community. The following are some kernel security measures:
- **Slow deletion**
If you run the `drop table` or `alter table ... drop partition` command, the database will not delete the tablespace file immediately. Instead, it will rename the file, gradually shrink it on the backend, and finally delete it. This feature can avoid system performance fluctuation caused by I/O load surges in the server's file system when a large tablespace file is deleted in one single request.
- **Accidental metadata deletion prevention**
Only authorized users can log in to the system and delete metadata tables, which helps prevent business unavailability due to faulty operations.
- **Banning of plugin installation by unauthorized users**
The database service provides standard APIs for users to implement custom features, but hackers usually exploit this vulnerability to launch attacks. Therefore, only specified admin users can mount plugins.
- **Banning of unauthorized user access to the physical server file system**
To prevent hackers from bypassing the security system by means such as file selection, file injection, and path detection, unauthorized users are blocked from accessing the directory structure and file system of the physical server.

## Data Termination
When you terminate your TencentDB for MariaDB instance, all data (including backup data) stored in it will be destroyed. Tencent Cloud will not retain the data or actively recover your instance.

## Suggestions on 1-DC Disaster Recovery Deployment
When deploying 1-DC disaster recovery, you should prevent the following failures for your database cluster:
- Single points of failures on devices such as data center switch, load balancer, and ENI.
- Single points of failures on devices such as rack power, fan, and cooler.
- Single points of failures on database server hardware.

Therefore, we recommend you satisfy at least the following requirements for 1-DC disaster recovery deployment:
- Deploy at least active-active disaster recovery for network devices such as switch and load balancer.
- Deploy one primary and two replicas for the database server and management and scheduling system.
- Deploy different devices of the same module across racks.
- Deploy a data backup module.


## Suggestions on 2-Region-3-DC Deployment
2-region-3-DC deployment is to add a disaster recovery center based on 1-region-2-DC deployment. The two disaster recovery instances are synced over a data communication network (DCN) to ensure data consistency.
