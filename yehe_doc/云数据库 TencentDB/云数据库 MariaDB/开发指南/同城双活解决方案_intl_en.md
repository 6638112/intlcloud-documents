Currently, TencentDB for MariaDB supports the intra-city 2-DC active-active scheme, which has the following main features:
- Intra-city 2-DC deployment
- 2-DC writability: if your servers are deployed in different subnets of two DCs, you can connect to the database and write data to it from any server in either DC.
- Automatic failover/restoration
- Unique access IP of both DCs

However, the intra-city 2-DC active-active scheme alone cannot implement disaster recovery at the business system level. Actually, it is easy to switch a single system/module to an intra-city disaster recovery DC, but the complicated correlation among and configurations in enterprise-level system businesses are challenges for the 2-DC scheme.

Therefore, **to build an active-active business system, the design, use, management, and system upgrade of the business must be implemented based on real-time use of and configuration interoperability between both DCs.** In this way, the business can be quickly resumed with no or only slight modification required in case of failures. This is also the goal of designing TencentDB for MariaDB's intra-city 2-DC active-active scheme. It allows business systems in both DCs to fully read from and write to the database system over the local network while ensuring strong database consistency.

## Design Standard
The active-active feature of TencentDB for MariaDB is designed based on "GB/T 20988-2007 Information Security Technology - Disaster Recovery Specifications for Information System". For a single database module:
- RTO ≤ 60 seconds
- RPO ≤ 5 seconds
- Failover time ≤ 5 seconds
- Failure detection time ≤ 30 seconds

This means that it takes about 40 seconds to complete failover after a failure occurs (including failure detection time).

- Risk warning: when performing tests in a real environment, please make sure that the business system has an automatic database reconnection mechanism. The business system usually has multiple modules, and each module may be associated with multiple data sources; therefore, the more complex the system, the longer the recovery time.


## Support
### Supported items

- Standard edition: one master and one slave (two node) or one master and two slaves (three nodes);

Network requirement: VPC only;
Supported regions:
- Beijing (Beijing Zone 1 and Beijing Zone 3)

### Pricing
Dual-AZ and single-AZ schemes are offered at the same price. For more information, please see [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/2034).

- Risk warning: the Direct Connect service for 2-DC data sync was free of charge before June 30, 2019. If the operating policy changes in the future, the price will not be higher than that of intra-city Direct Connect published by Tencent Cloud. If you do not want to continue using the intra-city 2-DC scheme, you can migrate your data to the intra-city 1-DC scheme free of charge.

### Purchase and use
Go to the [purchase page of TencentDB for MariaDB](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/mariadb) and click **Buy Now**.
- If the master and slave AZs are the same, the single-AZ deployment scheme is used.
- If the master and slave AZs are different, the intra-city 2-DC deployment scheme is used.

>**Note:**
>- The master AZ is the zone where your master server is located. The database should be assigned in the same VPC subnet as the master server to reduce access delay. A slave AZ is the zone where a slave node of the database is located. For the one master and two slaves architecture (three nodes) , two nodes will be deployed in the master AZ. For the one master and one slave architecture (two nodes), one node will be deployed in the master AZ.



### Instance initialization
For more information on how to initialize an instance, please see [Instance Initialization](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/7055?from_cn_redirect=1).


### Viewing details of instance AZ
You can view them on the instance details page.

### Master/slave switch
To switch the master node from one AZ to another, you can simply click "Master/Slave Switch". As this operation is highly risky, the IP address of the login account must be verified. The switch process may cause a momentary disconnection from the database (≤ 1s). Please make sure that your business has a database reconnection mechanism. Frequent switching may result in business system exceptions or even data exceptions.

## How It Works
By integrating the highly available master/slave architecture of TencentDB for MariaDB with virtual IP drifting of VPC AZ, simultaneous reads from and writes to two DCs can be implemented. This architecture has the following features:
- Proxy modules are deployed in a mixed manner on the frontend of each TencentDB for MariaDB database node, which are responsible for routing data requests to corresponding database nodes;
- Cross-region VPC gateway is deployed before the proxy module is deployed, and virtual IP drifting is supported;
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/a714b045d40ad44223f03e5d5fede0fd.png)

As shown above, taking data writes as an example: if the business server is deployed in AZ A, the PC gateway will forward the data request to the proxy gateway in AZ A which will then transparently forward it to the master node. If the business server is deployed in AZ B, the VPC gateway will forward the data request to proxy gateway in AZ B which will then forward it to the master node over Tencent Cloud's BGP network.
No matter whether it is a read or write request, the entire process is imperceptible to the business. In case of database exception, the database cluster will be processed as follows:
1. If both the master and proxy fail, the cluster will automatically promote the optimal slave to the new master. The system will notify the VPC to modify the association between the virtual and physical IPs. The business will only perceive that some write requests are disconnected.
2. If the master fails but the proxy is normal, the cluster will automatically promote the optimal slave to the new master. The proxy will block requests until master/slave switch is completed. In this case, the business will only perceive that some requests time out.
3. If the slave fails (no matter whether the proxy fails), if read/write separation is enabled, an operation will be performed according to the **read-only policy** of the preconfigured read-only account (there are three types of policies).
4. If AZ A completely fails, while the VPC and database are still alive in AZ B, the slave 2 node will be automatically promoted to the master node. **The read/write policy of the node will be adjusted according to the strong sync policy**, and the VPC IP will drift to AZ B. In this case, the cluster will try to recover the node in AZ A. If the node cannot be recovered within 30 minutes, at least one slave node will be automatically created on node B. As there is an IP drifting policy, no database configuration modification is required of the business.
5. If DC B completely fails, it is equivalent to the failure of a slave node in the TencentDB for MariaDB cluster, and the failure can be processed in the same way as described in item 3 above.

## FAQs
#### 1. Compared with intra-city 1-DC, will the intra-city 2-DC scheme cause a decrease in performance?
Based on the strong sync replication scheme, as the cross-DC delay is slightly larger than that between devices in the same DC, the speed of SQL response will drop by about 5% in theory.

#### 2. Is it possible for a master node to switch from the master AZ to the slave AZ?
Yes. You can ignore this if it does not affect the use of your business. If you are concerned about the impact, you can switch back by using the master/slave switch feature in the console during off-peak hours.

#### 3. How do I know that master/slave switch is performed in the database cluster?
Log in to the console and select Cloud Monitor's Alarm Policy > TencentDB for MariaDB to configure an alarm on master/slave switch.

#### 4. If part of the read/write requests are read from/written to the slave AZ, the network delay will cause a decrease in performance, but I need the intra-city 2-DC feature. What should I do?
You can submit a ticket indicating the instance ID, deployment scheme of your servers in the AZ, and the ratio between read and write requests. Tencent Cloud DBA can help you adjust the 2-AZ loading mechanism to minimize the number of read and write requests sustained by the slave AZ.

#### 5. If I want to change from the 1-DC architecture to intra-city 2-DC architecture, what should I do?
Check whether the intra-city 2-DC scheme is supported in your region. It is now available in Beijing. Then, submit a ticket indicating the information of the account to be adjusted, instance ID, two AZs to be used, and recommended OPS time. Tencent Cloud staff will conduct an audit. If your request is eligible, the operation can be performed; otherwise, it will be rejected.
