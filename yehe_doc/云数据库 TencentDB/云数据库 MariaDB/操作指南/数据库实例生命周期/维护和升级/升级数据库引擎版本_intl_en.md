### Upgrading the Major Version of the Database Engine
Upgrade of the major version of the database engine refers to such upgrade as upgrading MariaDB 10.0 to 10.1.
Currently, major version upgrade is not supported. If needed, you are recommended to purchase an instance on the new version. After testing is completed, migrate data from the old instance to the new one and switch the business system.

### Upgrading the Version of the Database Cluster Module
Upgrading feature modules such as Agent and Proxy in the cluster to their latest version does not involve business system compatibility issues. If needed, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application and specify "instance region, instance ID, upgrade requirement, and scheduled switch time". The upgrade in this case works in the same way as upgrading instance specification. For more information, please see [How Upgrade Works](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/237/8484).
