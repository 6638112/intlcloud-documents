Instance upgrade refers to upgrading the current instance to a higher specification. There will be a momentary disconnection (for seconds) during the upgrade process; therefore, you are recommended to upgrade your instances during off-peak hours.
- The upgrade process cannot be aborted.
- Downgrading is not supported in the console currently. If needed, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for application.


1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MariaDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsql), select the desired instance, and select **More** > **Upgrade** in the "Operation" column. ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/0f3bf9350d6da469adc38c91d76f3c76.png)
2. In the dialog box that pops up, select the desired specification based on your needs and make the payment. Once payment is successful, the system will automatically upgrade the instance specification.
