Instance upgrade refers to the process in which an existing TencentDB instance is upgraded to higher specifications. During upgrade, the service will be interrupted for just a few seconds, so you are recommended to upgrade your instance during off-peak hours.
- The upgrade process cannot be interrupted.
- Currently, you cannot downgrade an instance in the console. If needed, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

Upgrade fee = (price of target specification - price of original specification) x remaining validity period

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MariaDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsql). In the instance list, select an instance and click **More** > **Adjust Configurations** in the "Operation" column.

2. In the dialog box that pops up, select the desired specification based on your needs and make the payment. Once payment is successful, the system will automatically upgrade the instance specification.
