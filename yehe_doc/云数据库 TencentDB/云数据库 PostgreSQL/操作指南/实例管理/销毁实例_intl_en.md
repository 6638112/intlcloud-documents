## Overview
Based on your business needs, you can manually terminate pay-as-you-go instances.
- Manually terminate pay-as-you-go instances in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres).

>!
>- After the instance is terminated, its data cannot be recovered, and its backup files will also be terminated, so the data cannot be restored in the cloud. Please store your backup files safely elsewhere in advance.
>- After an instance is terminated, the refund procedures are as detailed below:
>  - For instances that met the 5-day no-questions-asked refund policy, the payment will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account.
>  - For normal instances, the payment will be returned to your Tencent Cloud account by the proportion of the cash and gift cards paid for the purchase.
>  - For an order placed from promotion rewarding channels, 25% of the actual cash payment amount will be deducted from the refund amount as a refund handling fee. Currently, self-service refund is unavailable for such kind of orders, and the refund application should be initiated by [submitting a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
