A security group is an instance-level firewall provided by Tencent Cloud for controlling inbound traffic of TencentDB. You can associate a security group with an instance when purchasing it or later in the console.
In TencentDB for PostgreSQL, primary instances, read-only instances, and read-only instance groups (RO groups) can use security groups which are independent from each other.

>?
>- A TencentDB for PostgreSQL instance can associate with up to five security groups.
>- The security group of an RO group controls the access address of the RO group itself rather than the access addresses of the read-only instances in this RO group. For example, if the access from an IP is allowed by the security group of an RO group but denied by that of a read-only instance in the RO group, this IP can still access to the read-only instance using the access address of the RO group instead of the access address of the read-only instance.

## Prerequisites
You have created security groups for TencentDB instances in the security group console. For more information, please see [Managing Security Groups](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/409/40112).

## Associating Security Groups with Primary/Read-Only Instances
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres). In the instance list, click the ID/name of the instance to be associated and enter the instance management page.
2. On the **Security Group** page, click **Configure Security Group**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the security group to be associated and click **OK**.

## Associating Security Groups with RO Groups
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres). In the instance list, click the ID/name of a read-only instance in the desired RO group and enter the instance management page.
2. On the **Security Group** page, select **RO Group** for **Object Type** in the **Security Group Object** section and click **Configure Security Group** in the **Associated Security Group** section.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the security group to be associated and click **OK**. 

## Adjusting the Priorities of Security Groups
You can associate up to five security groups with a TencentDB instance. If you have associated multiple security groups, these security groups are executed based on their priorities. You can adjust the priorities as follows.

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/postgres), click an instance ID/name in the instance list, and enter the instance management page.
2. Select the **Security Group** page.
3. In the **Associated Security Group** section, click **Edit**, and click the **Move up** or **Move down** icon in the **Operation** column to adjust the priorities. A security group ranking higher in the list has a higher priority. Configurations of all the security groups are connected by OR. If the configurations of two security groups conflict, whichever has a higher priority will prevail.
4. After adjusting the priority, click **Save**.
