## Upgrading Instances
Instance upgrade refers to upgrade the specification of an existing TencentDB instance. During upgrade, the database service will be interrupted for just a few seconds, so we recommend you upgrade your instance during off-peak hours. Once the upgrade process begins, it cannot be stopped. Instance downgrade is not supported on the console.

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for PostgreSQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/pgsql), locate the desired instance in the instance list, and click **Upgrade** in the **Operation** column.
2. In the pop-up dialog box, select the desired specification and make the payment. Once the payment is completed, the instance is automatically upgraded to the target specification.

**Upgrade fees = (price of target specification - price of original specification) x remaining validity period**
