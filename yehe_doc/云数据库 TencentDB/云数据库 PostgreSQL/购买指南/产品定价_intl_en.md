## Billing Example

**Pay-as-you-go billing example**: suppose you purchase a pay-as-you-go TencentDB for PostgreSQL instance with 32 GB memory and 500 GB disk capacity in the Singapore region and you use this instance for 400 hours.
The fees are calculated as follows:

Tier 1 fee: (32 GB x 0.07 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00024 USD/GB/hr) x 96 hours = 226.56 USD
Tier 2 fee: (32 GB x 0.053 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00024 USD/GB/hr) x 264 hours = 479.556 USD
Tier 3 fee: (32 GB x 0.035 USD/GB/hr + 500 GB x 0.00024 USD/GB/hr) x 40 hours = 49.6 USD
Your instance fees = Tier 1 fee + Tier 2 fee + Tier 3 fee = 755.716 USD
