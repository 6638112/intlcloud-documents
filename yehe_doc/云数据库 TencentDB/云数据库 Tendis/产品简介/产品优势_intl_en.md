### Cost Effectiveness and Ease of Use
#### Flexible billing
The pay-as-you-go billing mode is available, so you don't have to invest a lump sum of money in infrastructure construction.

#### Elastic scaling
An instance can be scaled quickly in the console without having to stop the services, and no operations are required from you.

### Ultra-high Performance
The standard architecture has a performance of up to 100,000+ QPS, and the cluster architecture supports tens of millions of QPS. Their ultra-high performance can perfectly meet the needs in most business scenarios ranging from gaming, mobile apps to advertising and ecommerce.

### High Availability
TencentDB for Tendis adopts a primary/secondary hot backup architecture. In case of failures of the primary, the access can be switched to the secondary in a matter of seconds. The switchover process does not affect the online business nor does it require any operations from you, reducing the labor and time costs of developing a primary/secondary architecture.

### High Reliability
Data is stored online in a primary/secondary architecture, ensuring high data security. Moreover, backup data can be stored for an extended time period, allowing for data recovery in case of a database disaster.

### Low Costs
Unlike Redis using memory as a storage medium, TencentDB for Tendis keeps data on the disk; therefore, it can greatly reduce the storage costs. In addition, it also provides a hybrid storage edition, where cold data is automatically transitioned and cached to achieve a better balance between cost and performance.

### Large Capacity
TencentDB for Tendis stores data on cloud disks. Therefore, it can provide a storage capacity of up to 32 TB in the standard architecture. Its storage capacity in the cluster architecture can be expanded horizontally to offer a theoretically unlimited capacity.

### Rich Monitoring Capabilities
TencentDB for Tendis provides over 30 professional monitoring metrics and customizable alarms for clear insights into the database data, such as the inbound/outbound traffic metric, helping you identify risks before they appear and troubleshoot problems quickly.
