### Full Compatibility
TDSQL-C separates the computing and storage of open-source databases. The storage is built on Tencent Cloud's distributed cloud storage service, and the computing layer is fully compatible with open-source database engines MySQL 5.7 and PostgreSQL 10, so that your businesses can be smoothly migrated without modifications.

### Ultra-High Performance
The ultra-high performance of a single node can sustain millions of QPS, which meets the requirements in high-concurrency and high-performance scenarios, ensures the continuity of key businesses, and further provides read/write separation and read/write scalability.

### Massive Storage Capacity
TDSQL-C has a massive storage capacity of up to 128 TB in the serverless architecture and features auto scaling, fault check, and repair. It is pay-as-you-go, so you only need to pay for what you use. It helps you easily cope with dynamic changes and continuous growth of your business data volume. In addition, it automatically maintains multiple data replicas to ensure the data security and reliability.

### Fast Fault Recovery
Compute nodes are stateless and support failover and recovery within seconds. Even if the physical machine where a compute node resides is down, it can be recovered in less than one minute.

### Fast and Flexible Configuration Adjustment
Compute nodes can be quickly upgraded/downgraded according to business needs without causing disconnections. Upgrade/Downgrade can be completed within seconds at the soonest subject to the memory size, which optimizes the costs of computing resources.

### Fast Read-only Scaling
1â€“15 read-only compute nodes can be quickly added in a cluster within seconds, enabling fast response to business surges and fluctuations.

### Snapshot Backup and Restoration
The fast snapshot backup feature based on multiple replicas of data provides continuous backup protection for your data and eliminates the need for sync and migration of backup data in the primary-secondary architecture. Up to gigabytes of data can be rolled back per second, ensuring the rapid restoration of business data.
