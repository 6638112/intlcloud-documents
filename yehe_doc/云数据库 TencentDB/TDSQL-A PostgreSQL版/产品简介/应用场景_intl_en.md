## Data Warehouse
Based on the shared-nothing architecture, TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL can smoothly scale the cluster, sustain gigabytes to petabytes of data, and use its fully parallel architecture and vectorized execution engine to efficiently process JOIN queries involving tens of billions of rows in multiple tables. This makes it ideal for operational data stores (ODSs), enterprise data warehouses (EDWs), and data marts (DMs).

## Storage of Massive Amounts of Data and Real-time Online Analysis
With the rapid increase in the number of internet users and long-term operations of the system, more and more data has been accumulated, incurring high storage costs in some industries (such as payment businesses, where data must be stored persistently for the purpose of regulatory compliance) and bringing urgent performance problems of complex correlated subqueries in scenarios with high data volumes.

The online linear scaling capabilities of TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL can scale the cluster as needed to ensure that the cluster can store petabytes of data and automatically move infrequently accessed historical business data to cheaper storage devices, striking a balance between performance and cost.

## System Dependent on High Data Security 
In government, civic service, and finance industries, a lot of personal information and financial transaction data are stored, and data security is the top priority, because once the data is lost or leaked, it will cause incalculable losses. Therefore, this type of businesses is highly dependent on the security of the database system that stores core data, including data query result encryption, data storage encryption, and post-transaction audit.

TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL can provide multi-level security policies to protect the security of such systems.

## Multi-Point Aggregation Business System
Governments, banks, and large-sized state-owned enterprises usually use an HQ-branch-division organization architecture. As a result, some of their core IT systems are also built in this architecture, yet different divisions may use different databases. As the needs for business interconnection, personnel communication, and information exchange become increasingly stronger, businesses are gradually aggregated to the HQ. Therefore, whether data can be aggregated efficiently is a very important metric of the system.

TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL has efficient heterogeneous database replication capabilities to share data properly among multiple databases.

## Oracle Elimination
In recent years, there has been a growing trend for eliminating IBM, Oracle, and EMC services from IT systems in various industries, among which Oracle elimination is relatively difficult.

As a highly scalable database cluster service, TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL is compatible with PostgreSQL syntaxes and most Oracle syntaxes, and further offers various enterprise-grade features such as stored procedure, window function, and unstructured data, making it an ideal substitute for Oracle databases. Therefore, using TDSQL-A for PostgreSQL to replace Oracle data warehouse applications can greatly reduce the migration costs.
