## Pay-as-You-Go TencentDB Instances Arrears

### Balance alert

The system estimates the number of days it takes your account balance to become negative based on the past 24 hours usage and current balance. If itâ€™s less than 5 days, the system will send a balance alert to your Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via email, and SMS.



### Arrears alert

For pay-as-you-go resources, fees are deducted on the hour. When your account balance becomes negative, we will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via email and SMS.



### Arrears processing

**Starting from the moment your account balance becomes negative:**

- You can continue to use your database for 24 hours from the moment your account balance becomes negative. We will continue to bill you for this period.
- When your account has been in arrears for 24 hours, **your database instances will automatically shut down, and we will stop billing you for this service**.

**After automatic shutdown:**

- Within 3 days of automatic shutdown, if your account is not brought up to a positive balance, you will not be able to start up your database; if your balance is positive, billing continues, and you can start up your database.
- If your account balance remains negative for 3 days after shutdown, the database will be repossessed, and **all data will be deleted and cannot be recovered**.

We will notify the Tencent Cloud account creator and all collaborators via email and SMS when the database is repossessed.

> **Note:**
>
> After you stop using pay-as-you-go resources, **terminate them as soon as possible** to avoid further fee incursion.
> Since your actual resource consumption is constantly changing, some slight discrepancies may exist for your stated balance.
