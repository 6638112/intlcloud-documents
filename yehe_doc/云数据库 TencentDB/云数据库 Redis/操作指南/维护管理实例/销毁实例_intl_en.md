## Overview
Based on your business needs, you can manually terminate pay-as-you-go instances.
- In the pay-as-you-go (aka postpaid) billing mode, you can request for resources on-demand and will be charged based on the actual usage upon settlement. To return an instance, you can terminate it, and a terminated instance will no longer incur fees.
>!After the instance is terminated, all data will be cleared and cannot be recovered. Please be sure to back up your data first before submitting a termination task.
