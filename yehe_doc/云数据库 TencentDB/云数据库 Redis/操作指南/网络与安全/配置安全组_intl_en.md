## Overview
A [security group](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/12452) is a stateful virtual firewall capable of filtering. As an important means for network security isolation provided by Tencent Cloud, it can be used to set network access controls for one or more TencentDB instances. Instances with the same network security isolation demands in one region can be put into the same security group, which is a logical group. TencentDB and CVM share the security group list and are matched with each other within the security group based on rules.

>?
> - TencentDB security group currently only supports network access control for VPCs and public network but not the classic network.
> - As TencentDB does not have active outbound traffic, outbound rules are not applicable to TencentDB.
> - TencentDB for Redis security group supports master, read-only, and disaster recovery instances.

## Security Group Configuration for TencentDB
### Step 1. Create a security group
1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup).
2. Select **Security Groups** on the left sidebar, select a region, and click **New**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, configure the following items and click **OK**.
 - Template: select an appropriate template based on the service to be deployed on the TencentDB instance in the security group, which simplifies the security group rule configuration, as shown below:
<table>
	<tr><th>Template</th><th>Description</th><th>Remarks</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Open all ports</td><td>All ports are opened to the public and private networks. This may present security issues.</td><td>-</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Open ports 22, 80, 443, and 3389 and the ICMP protocol</td><td>Ports 22, 80, 443, and 3389 and the ICMP protocol are opened to the internet. All ports are opened to the private network.</td><td>This template does not take effect for TencentDB.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Custom</td><td>You can create a security group and then add custom rules. For detailed directions, please see "Step 2. Add a security group rule"</a> below.</td><td>-</rd></tr>
</table>
 - Name: custom name of the security group.
 - Project: the **default project** is selected by default. You can also select another one for easier management.
 - Remarks: a short description of the security group for easier management.

### Step 2. Add a security group rule
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, click **Modify Rules** in the "Operation" column on the row of the security group for which to configure a rule.
2. <span id="step02">On the security group rule page, click **Inbound rule** > **Add a Rule**.</span>
3. In the pop-up dialog box, set the rule.
 - Type: "Custom" is selected by default. You can also choose another system rule template.
 - Source: traffic source (inbound rule) or destination (outbound rule). You need to specify one of the following options:
<table>
	<tr><th>Source/Destination</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>IPv4 address or IPv4 address range</td><td>In CIDR format (such as <code>203.0.113.0</code>, <code>203.0.113.0/24</code>, or <code>0.0.0.0/0</code>, where <code>0.0.0.0/0</code> indicates all IPv4 addresses).</td></tr>
	<tr><td>IPv6 address or IPv6 address range</td><td>In CIDR format (such as <code>FF05::B5</code>, <code>FF05:B5::/60</code>, <code>::/0</code>, or <code>0::0/0</code>, where <code>::/0</code> or <code>0::0/0</code> indicate all IPv6 addresses).</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ID of referenced security group. You can reference the ID of: <ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>Current security group</li><li>Another security group</li></ul>
</td><td><ul  style="margin: 0;"><li>Current security group: CVM instance associated with the current security group.</li><li>Another security group: ID of another security group in the same region under the same project.</li></ul>
</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Reference an IP address object or IP address group object in a <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31867">parameter template</a>.</td><td>-</td></tr>
</table>
 - Protocol port: enter the protocol type and port range. You can view the port (which is 6379 by default) on the [instance details page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis) in the TencentDB for Redis Console. You can also reference a protocol port or protocol port group in a [parameter template](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31867).

 - Policy: "Allow" is selected by default.
    - Allow: traffic to this port is allowed.
    - Refuse: data packets will be discarded without any response.
 - Notes: a short description of the rule for easier management.
4. <span id="step04">Click **Complete** to finish adding the inbound rule.</span>


### Step 3. Configure a security group
A security group is an instance-level firewall provided by Tencent Cloud for controlling inbound traffic of TencentDB. You can associate a security group with an instance when purchasing it or later in the console.

>!Currently, security groups can be configured only for **TencentDB for Redis instances in VPC**.

1. Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis) and click an instance name in the instance list to enter the instance management page.
2. On the instance management page, select the **Security Group** tab, click **Configure Security Group**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the security group to be bound and click **OK**. 

## Security Group Rule Import
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, click the ID/name of the target security group.
2. On the inbound rules or outbound rules tab, click **Import Rule**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select an edited inbound/outbound rule template file and click **Import**.
>? If there are existing rules in the security group, export them before importing new rules. Existing rules are overwritten after importing.


## Security Group Clone
1. On the [Security Group](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup) page, locate the desired security group and click **More** > **Clone** in the "Operation" column.
2. In the pop-up dialog box, select the target region and target project, enter the new security group name, and click **OK**. If the new security group needs to be associated with a CVM instance, do so by managing the CVM instances in the security group.

## Security Group Deletion
1. On the [security group page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/securitygroup), locate the security group to be deleted and click **More** > **Delete** in the "Operation" column.
2. Click **OK** in the pop-up dialog box. If the current security group is associated with a CVM instance, it must be disassociated before it can be deleted.
