TencentDB for Redis provides a complete and easy-to-use monitoring service where you donâ€™t have to worry about, for example, collecting monitoring data or OPS of the monitoring system. The monitoring service includes Proxy monitoring, Redis monitoring, and instance monitoring which summarizes the monitoring data of an entire instance.
- Proxy monitoring: provides monitoring information of all Proxy nodes in an instance. TencentDB for Redis instances in standard or cluster architecture have Proxy nodes.
- Redis monitoring: provides monitoring information of master and replica Redis nodes.
- Instance monitoring: summarizes the monitoring data of an entire instance (including Proxy nodes and Proxy nodes) and aggregates data according to the SUM, AVG, MAX, and LAST aggregation algorithms.

## Description of the Five-second Monitoring Granularity
- By default, new instances (excluding CKV instances) support five-second granularity.
- In the future, you can modify the monitoring granularity of existing instances from one minute to five seconds in the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis). Please pay attention to the notices and pop-up notifications in the console.
- In the [Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/policylist/create), alarm policies for five-second granularity are of a different policy type from those for one-minute granularity. You can replicate the alarm policies for one-minute granularity and change their policy types to **Memory Edition (5-second granularity)**, so that these alarm policies can be associated with new instances supporting five-second granularity.

## Viewing Instance Monitoring Granularity
- Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis), click an instance ID and enter the instance management page, select **System Monitoring** > **Monitoring Metrics**, and click the **Period** drop-down list at the top. If you can select **5 seconds** from the drop-down list, this instance supports the monitoring granularity of five seconds, or else it supports only the monitoring granularity of one minute.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/e7833ebba07a4dd949c911c58940a4d0.png)
- Check the value of the `InstanceSet.MonitorVersion` field returned by the [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/32065) API. If the value is `5s`, this instance supports the monitoring granularity of five seconds; if the value is `1m`, it supports only the monitoring granularity of one minute.

## Monitoring Granularity and Monitoring Data Retention Period
TencentDB for Redis currently supports monitoring metrics at the five-second, one-minute, five-minutes, one-hour, or one-day granularity. For the retention period of monitoring data at each granularity, please see [Use Limits](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/32803).

## Viewing Monitoring Information
You can view TencentDB for Redis monitoring information in the instance list and on the instance monitoring page in the TencentDB for Redis console, or in the Cloud Monitor console.
- Instance list: log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis), click the **View Monitoring** icon in the instance list as shown below, and view monitoring metrics in the pop-up window on the right.

## Monitoring Metric Description
### Proxy node monitoring
Each TencentDB for Redis instance contains at least 3 Proxy nodes. Generally, the number of Proxy nodes is 1.5 times that of Redis nodes. The Proxy node supports the following monitoring metrics:

## Querying Node Information
Use the [DescribeInstanceNodeInfo](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/38627) API to get the IDs of Proxy nodes and Redis nodes.
>!The IDs of Proxy and Redis nodes will change when node failover, instance capacity expansion/reduction, data migration, etc., occur. Therefore, we recommend that you get the latest node information from the API in a timely manner.
