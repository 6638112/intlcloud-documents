## Monitoring Granularity
TencentDB for Redis now supports one-minute and five-second monitoring granularities. Since October 2020, monitoring at the five-second granularity has been supported, providing more monitoring metrics and proxy monitoring data. For more information, see [Update Notes of Monitoring at Five-Second Granularity](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/38742).

### Changes of monitoring granularity
#### One-minute monitoring granularity
- Instances created before October 20, 2020 only support the [one-minute monitoring granularity](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/34589), but they are gradually upgraded to support the five-second granularity.
- View the monitoring data in the Cloud Monitor console: **[Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/product/redis)** > **TencentDB** > **Redis (1-minute granularity)**.

#### Five-second monitoring granularity
- Instances created after October 20, 2020 support both one-minute and [five-second monitoring granularities](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/38743).
- View the monitoring data in the Cloud Monitor console: **[Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/product/redis_mem_edition)** > **TencentDB** > **Redis (5-second granularity)**.


### Notes of monitoring granularity upgrade
To support five-second monitoring granularity, the proxy of your TencentDB for Redis instances needs to be upgraded to the latest version.
Note that the proxy upgrade will cause a short disconnection. The business needs to reconnect to the proxy after the upgrade completes.
1. Upgrade by Tencent Cloud backend: Tencent Cloud is upgrading all instances to support five-second monitoring granularity. You will be notified via SMS, email, or Message Center before the upgrade starts.
2. Upgrade by yourself in the TencentDB console: you can soon manually upgrade instances in the console.
3. After all instances are upgraded, the one-minute monitoring granularity will be no longer supported.

### Changes of monitoring metrics
After the monitoring granularity is narrowed from one minute to five seconds, monitoring metric names are changed and some new metrics are supported, as shown below:

### Viewing the monitoring granularity of an instance
- Check the value of the `InstanceSet.MonitorVersion` field returned by the [DescribeInstances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/32065) API. If the value is `5s`, this instance supports the monitoring granularity of five seconds; if the value is `1m`, it supports only the monitoring granularity of one minute.
- Log in to the [TencentDB for Redis console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/redis), click an instance name/ID and enter the instance management page, select **System Monitoring** > **Monitoring Metrics**, and click the **Period** drop-down list at the top. If you can select **5 seconds** from the drop-down list, this instance supports the monitoring granularity of five seconds, or else it supports only the monitoring granularity of one minute.


## Alarm Changes
### Changes of alarm policy configurations
After the monitoring metrics are upgraded, you need to configure one-minute-granularity and five-second-granularity alarm policies in different windows in the [Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/alarm2/policy/create), as show below:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b2c030de1c2e925a6421813c43dd7862.png)

### Impact of monitoring upgrade
After the monitoring granularity is narrowed from one minute to five seconds, you need to migrate the one-minute-granularity alarm policies to the five-second-granularity alarm policies. The monitoring metrics applicable to the five-second granularity alarm policies are different from those applicable to one-minute granularity alarm policies. For more information, see [Changes of monitoring metrics](#jjzbbh).
After the monitoring granularity is narrowed down to five seconds:
- Monitoring data at both one-minute and five-second granularities are reported temporarily, that is, Cloud Monitor will stop reporting the one-minute-granularity data in the future.
- One-minute-granularity alarm policies are valid temporarily.
- The default five-second-granularity alarm policy is associated. Please specify alarm recipients for the default policy.

### Migrating alarm policies
- Manual migration: copy the existing one-minute-granularity alarm policies as the five-second-granularity alarm policies, but you need to configure alarm recipients for the five-second-granularity alarm policies.
- Automatic migration: after the monitoring granularity upgrade completes, the existing one-minute-granularity alarm policies will be automatically migrated to the five-second-granularity alarm policies, and you will be notified via SMS, email, or Message Center.
