### Ecommerce Display
In ecommerce display, data such as product images and recommendations can be stored in TencentDB for Redis for quick access. In addition, the high QPS performance (up to tens of millions) of Redis can sustain high concurrent requests, making it ideal for large-scale campaigns (e.g., flash sales).
