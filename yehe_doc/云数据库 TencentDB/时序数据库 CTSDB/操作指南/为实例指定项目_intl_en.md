CTSDB supports assigning instances to different projects for management.

Notes:
- Assigning and reassigning TencentDB instances will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The **Default Project** will be used if you don't specify one.
- Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects on the instance details page in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ctsdb).
