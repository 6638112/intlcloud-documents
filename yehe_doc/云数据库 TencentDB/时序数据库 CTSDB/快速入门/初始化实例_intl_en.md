After [creating a CTSDB instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1100/40933), you need to initialize it before you can enable it.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [CTSDB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/ctsdb), select an instance in **Uninitialized** status in the instance list, and select **More** > **Initialize** in the **Operation** column.

3. You will be redirected to the instance list. After the status of the instance becomes **Running**, it can be used normally.
