TencentDB for SQL Server supports assigning instances to different projects for management.
Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver). In the instance list, click an instance ID to enter the details page, and click **Switch to another project** in "Project" to assign the instance to a project.

- Read-only instances are associated instances of the master instance and should be in the same project as the master instance.
- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The default project is **Default Project**.
- Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects through the **Switch to another project** feature.
