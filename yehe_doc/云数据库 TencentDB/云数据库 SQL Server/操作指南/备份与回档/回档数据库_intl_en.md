## Operation Scenarios
TencentDB for SQL Server provides a rollback tool for rolling back an instance. Historical data can be re-constructed by using the periodical backups and real-time transactions so as to roll back the instance to a specified time point where the time slices of all data are guaranteed to be identical.
The data and log backups in TencentDB for SQL Server are retained for seven days; therefore, you can roll back the instance data to any time point within the last seven days. This document describes how to roll back an instance in the console.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver), click an instance name to enter the instance details page, and click **Rollback** in the top-right corner.
2. In the pop-up dialog box, select the database to be rolled back, set the rollback time, decide whether the original database should be overwritten, and click **Next**.
>
>- Rollback is currently only supported for the same instance, and you can choose to overwrite the original database or generate a duplicate database.
>- If you choose to generate a duplicate database, note that the disk capacity after rolling back cannot exceed the disk capacity available for the instance; otherwise, rollback will fail.

3. After confirming that the rollback information is correct, click **Rollback** to start the rollback task.
4. Return to the instance list where you can see that the instance status changes to "Executing task". You can view the rollback progress in the task list in the top-right corner on the details page.
