## Operation Scenarios
TencentDB for SQL Server supports migrating data from a CVM-based self-created SQL Server database to a TencentDB for SQL Server instance. This document describes how to configure and run such a migration task.
>
>- Before migration, please make sure that the SQL Server version of the target instance is not below that of the source instance.
>- For the .bak files used for migration, please make sure that each .bak file contains only one database.
>- The name of the migrated database cannot be the same as that of the TencentDB for SQL Server instance.

## Directions
### Step 1. Create a migration task
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for SQL Server Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/sqlserver) and select **Data Transfer** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Create Task**, enter the task name, source database information, and target database information, and select **CVM-based self-created SQL Server database** as the source instance type.

3. After clicking **Next**, you need to [configure the source SQL Server instance](#step2) first and then [configure the migration task](#step3).
>If the error message "Source instance info checking failed!" is displayed, please check the following items for troubleshooting:
>- Whether the sa account of the source SQL Server instance exists.
>- Whether the sa account password of the source SQL Server instance is correct.
>- Whether the IP and port connectivity of the source SQL Server instance work properly.

### Step 2. Configure the source SQL Server instance
1. Enable the sa account for the source SQL Server instance.
2. Select **Allow remote connections to this server** in **Connections** and set a reasonable remote query timeout period.

3. Select **SQL Server and Windows authentication mode** in **Security**.

4. Enable TCP/IP.

5. Enable the built-in account and select **localsystem**.

6. Allow SQL Server port communication and open port 445 (for the basic network) or 49001 (for a VPC) in Windows Firewall.
7. (Optional) If **VPC** is selected as the **CVM Network**, you need to configure the freeSSHd tool.
 1. Download and install [freeSSHd](http://www.freesshd.com/freeSSHd.exe) with the default options and agree to start the freeSSHd service.
 2. Double-click the freeSSHd icon on the desktop. Then, right-click the freeSSHd icon in the taskbar to open the Settings page for configuration.
 3. Select the **SSH** tab and set the port to 49001 (the default port here is 22, which should be changed to 49001). ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/72d8780b85afa18524dc2fb81bcd6baf.png)
 4. Select the **Server status** tab and start the SSH server.
 5. Select the **Authentication** tab and select **Allowed** for password authentication.
 6. Select the **Users** tab and enter the user `tencent_vpc_migrate` (this username cannot be changed) and the password `tencent_vpc_migrate` (this password cannot be changed) as shown below:

 7. Use `D:\dbbackup\` (**this path cannot be changed**) as the backup folder used during SQL Server migration. Select the **SFTP** tab and configure this path as the "SFTP home path".

### Step 3. Configure the migration task
Select the migration type, set the database (by selecting the databases/tables to be migrated), and click **Save and Verify**. If the verification fails, you can troubleshoot as prompted.


### Step 4. Start the migration task
After the task is created, return to the task list. At this point, the task status is **Initializing**. Select the task and click **Start** to sync the task.

### Step 5. Complete the migration task
After the data synchronization is completed (i.e., the progress bar shows 100%), you need to click **Complete** to end the synchronization process. If you selected **Incremental Synchronization** when configuring the migration task, you need to click **Complete** when the progress bar shows 99%. You can check whether the migration is successful on the **Status**.
 - If the task status is **task successful*, the data migration is successful.
 - If the status is **task failed*, the data migration failed. Please check the failure information, fix it accordingly, and then migrate again.
