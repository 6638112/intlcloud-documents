When you terminate your TencentDB for MySQL instance, all data (including backup data) stored in it will be destroyed. Tencent Cloud will not retain the data or actively recover your instance.

For more information, please see [Terminating Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/31895).
