This document describes how to set the database proxy access address in the TencentDB for MySQL console.

The database proxy access address is independent of the original database access address. Requests arriving at the proxy address are all relayed through the proxy cluster to access the source and replica nodes of the database. Read/Write separation is implemented, so that read requests are forwarded to read-only instances, which lowers the load of the source database.

## Prerequisites
You have [enabled database proxy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/41087).

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). In the instance list, select a source instance with proxy enabled and click its ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance management page.
2. On the instance management page, select the **Database Proxy** tab and click the <img src="https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/be716b5360d5256a9d5e816e29872ec1.png"  style="margin:0;"> icon next to **Database Proxy Address**.

3. In the pop-up window, modify the proxy address and click **OK**.
>!Modifying the private network address affects the database business being accessed. We recommend you modify the address during off-peak hours. Please make sure that your business has a reconnection mechanism.
