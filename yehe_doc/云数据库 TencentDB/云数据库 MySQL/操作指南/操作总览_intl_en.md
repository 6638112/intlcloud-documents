| Restart | In the instance list, select an instance and click **Restart** to restart it. You can also select multiple instances for batch restart. <li>During the restart, the instance will be inaccessible, and existing connections to it will be closed. Please be prepared for the restart to avoid business interruption. <li>During the restart, if the number of business writes is high and there are too many dirty pages, the restart will fail. In this case, the instance will go back to the state before the restart and become accessible. <li>Please restart instances during off-peak hours to ensure the restart success rate and reduce the impact on your business. |
