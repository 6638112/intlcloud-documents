## Overview
TencentDB for MySQL supports the transparent data encryption (TDE) feature. Transparent encryption means that the data encryption and decryption are imperceptible to users. TDE supports real-time I/O encryption and decryption of data files. It encrypts data before the data is written to disk, and decrypts data when the data is read into memory from disk, which meets the compliance requirements of static data encryption.

## Limits
- Only TencentDB for MySQL v5.7 supports TDE.
- To enable TDE, you need to activate the Key Management Service (KMS) first. If KMS has not been activated, you can activate it according to the instructions displayed in the console while enabling TDE.
- To enable TDE, you need to grant the KMS key permissions. If the permissions have not been granted, you can grant them according to the instructions displayed in the console while enabling TDE.
- To enable TDE, your account needs the `QcloudAccessForMySQLRole` permission. If the permission has not been granted, you can grant it according to the instructions displayed in the console while enabling TDE.
>?The keys used for encryption are generated and managed by [KMS](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/32774). TencentDB for MySQL does not provide keys or certificates required for encryption.

## Notes
- After the authorization is revoked, MySQL databases will be inaccessible upon restart.
- Once TDE is enabled, it cannot be disabled.
- After TDE is enabled, you need to decrypt data before you can restore it to a local database.
- TDE enhances the security of static data but reduces the read-write performance of encrypted databases. Enable or disable TDE according to your needs.
- If a source instance is associated with a disaster recovery instance, TDE must be enabled on the disaster recovery instance before the source instance can use TDE. Otherwise, the data synchronization of the disaster recovery instance may fail.

## Directions
### Enabling TDE
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb). In the instance list, click the instance ID/name or **Manage** in the "Operation" column to access the instance management page.
2. On the **Data Encryption** tab, click the toggle button next to **Encryption Status**.
>!
>- An instance with TDE enabled cannot be restored from a physical backup to a self-created database on another server.
>- Once TDE is enabled, it cannot be disabled.

3. In the pop-up dialog box, activate the KMS, grant the KMS key permissions, select a key, and click **Encrypt**.
  - If you select **Use key auto-generated by Tencent Cloud**, the key will be auto-generated by Tencent Cloud.

  - If you select **Use existing custom key**, you can select a key created by yourself.
  >?If there are no custom keys, click **go to create** to create keys in the KMS Console. For more information, please see [Creating a Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1030/31971).

### Encrypting a table
To encrypt a table of a MySQL instance with TDE enabled, you need to run the following DDL statements on the table.
- To encrypt a table upon creation, run the following statement:
```
CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT) ENCRYPTION=’Y’;
```
- To encrypt a table that has been created, run the following statement:
```
ALTER TABLE t1 ENCRYPTION=’Y’;
```

### Decrypting a table
To decrypt a table of a MySQL instance with TDE enabled, you need to run the following DDL statement on the table.
To decrypt an encrypted table, run the following statement:
```
ALTER TABLE t1 ENCRYPTION=’N’;
```
