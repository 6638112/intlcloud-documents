## Operation Scenarios
The backup space occupied by TencentDB for MySQL instance backup files is allocated by region. It is equivalent to the total storage capacity used by all MySQL database backups in a region, including automatic data backups, manual data backups, and log backups. Increasing the backup retention time or manual backup frequency will use more database backup storage capacity.

This document describes how to view the MySQL instance backup space and free tier in the console.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and select **Database Backup** on the left sidebar.
2. Select a region at the top to view its backup information on the **Overview** tab, including total backup, backup trend, and real-time backup statistics.
 - Total Backup: this section displays the size and quantity of all, data, and log backups as well as the free tier occupied by all the backups. 
>?
>- Green: the total backup space used does not exceed the free tier.
>- Orange: the total backup space used has exceeded the free tier and incurred fees. For more information, please see [Backup Space Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/32344).

 - Real-Time Backup Statistics: this section displays the names/IDs (you can click a name/ID to enter the instance details page), backup space values (which can be sorted by backup size), and data/log backups of instances in the selected region. You can search for an instance by name/ID in the search box in the top-right corner.
