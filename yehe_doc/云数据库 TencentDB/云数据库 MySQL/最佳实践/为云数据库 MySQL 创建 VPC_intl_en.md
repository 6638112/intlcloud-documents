Tencent Cloud provides [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535) for hosting TencentDB instances. You can launch Tencent Cloud resources such as TencentDB instances in a VPC.

A common scheme is to share data between a TencentDB instance and a web server running in the same VPC. This document uses this scheme to create a VPC and add a TencentDB instance to it.
This document describes how to add CVM and TencentDB for MySQL instances in the same VPC to interconnect cloud resources over the private network.

## Step 1. Create a VPC
A VPC has at least one subnet, and Tencent Cloud service resources can only be added in a subnet.
1. Log in to [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Select the region of the VPC at the top of the list and click **+New**.
3. Enter the VPC information and original subnet information and click **OK**. The CIDRs of the VPC and subnet cannot be modified after creation.
 - The VPC CIDR can be any of the following IP ranges. For VPCs to communicate with each other over the private network, their CIDRs should not overlap.
    - `10.0.0.0` - `10.255.255.255` (mask range between 16 and 28)
    - `172.16.0.0` - `172.31.255.255` (mask range between 16 and 28)
    - `192.168.0.0` - `192.168.255.255` (mask range between 16 and 28)
 - The subnet CIDR must be within or the same as the VPC CIDR.
 For example, if the IP range of a VPC is `192.168.0.0/16`, then that of its subnets can be `192.168.0.0/16`, `192.168.0.0/17`, etc.

## Step 2. Create a subnet
You can create one or more subnets at a time.
1. Log in to [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
3. Select the region and VPC in which the subnet is to be created and click **+New**.
4. Enter the subnetâ€™s name, CIDR, availability zone, and associated route table.

5. (Optional) Click **+Add a line** to create multiple subnets at a time.
6. Click **Create**.

## Step 3. Create a route table and associate it with a subnet
You can create a custom route table, edit its routing policy, and associate it with a specified subnet. The route table associated with a subnet is used to specify the outbound routes for the subnet.
1. Log in to the VPC console and select **Route Tables** on the left sidebar.
2. Select the region and VPC at the top of the list and click **+New**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the name, network, routing rules and click **Create**. Return to the route table list to view the newly created route table.

4. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar, select the subnet to be associated with the route table, and click **Change Route Table** in the **Operation** column to associate it.

## Step 4. Add a CVM instance
1. Log in to [VPC console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc).
2. Click **Subnet** on the left sidebar to enter the management page.
3. Click the **Add a CVM** icon in the row of the subnet where the CVM instance is to be added.

4. Complete the CVM purchase as instructed by the page. For more information, please see the [Purchasing Channels](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/506) documentation.

## Step 5. Add a TencentDB instance
#### New database
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb) and click **Create** in the instance list to enter the purchase page.
2. In the **Network** section on the purchase page, select the previously created VPC and the corresponding subnet, and add the new TencentDB instance to the VPC.

#### Existing database
1. In the instance list, click an instance name/ID or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to enter the instance details page.
2. In the **Network** section on the details page, switch to the corresponding VPC.
