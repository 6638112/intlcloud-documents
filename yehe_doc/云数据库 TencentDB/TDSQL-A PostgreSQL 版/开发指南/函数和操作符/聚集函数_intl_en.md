Aggregate functions, including built-in normal aggregate functions and ordered-set aggregate functions, compute a single result from a set of input values.
There are many types of aggregate functions. For the descriptions and special syntaxes of the most commonly used functions such as `sum`, `max`, `avg`, `count`, and `array_agg`, please see [Aggregate Functions](http://www.postgres.cn/docs/10/functions-aggregate.html).
