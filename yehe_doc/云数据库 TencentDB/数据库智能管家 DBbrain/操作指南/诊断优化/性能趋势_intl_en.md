The performance trends feature of DBbrain not only supports the selection of multiple performance metrics such as key metrics, all metrics, and custom metrics, but also supports multiple ways to view performance trends, such as fine-grained view of one single performance metric trend, link comparison view of multiple performance metric trends, and time comparison view of multiple performance metric trends.

>?Currently, the performance trends feature is supported for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the Basic Edition).

## Viewing Performance Trend Metrics
The performance trends feature supports selection of multiple performance metrics, including 4 categories (Resource Monitoring, MySQL Server, InnoDB Engine, and MySQL Replication) and 15 subcategories. You can select different metrics based on different OPS needs to view the performance trends of the selected instance against the selected metrics.

1. Log in to the [DBbrain console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/analysis) and select **Performance Optimization** on the left sidebar. On the displayed page, select a database at the top and select the **Performance Trends** tab.
2. On the performance trends page, click the **Select performance metrics** drop-down list.
3. On the performance metrics selection page, check performance metrics or select **Key Metrics**, **Select all** or **Deselect all** in the top-right corner, and click **OK**.
>?Click **Apply to all instances** to apply the selected metrics to all database instances.
