Database inspection is used to automate full instance health checks regularly. You can also set up custom inspections based on your own needs to help troubleshoot potential instance issues and provide solutions.
>?Currently, database inspection is supported for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the Basic Edition) and TencentDB for CynosDB (compatible with MySQL).

Log in to the [DBbrain Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/patrol), and select **Monitoring & Alarm** > **Database Inspection** on the left sidebar.
