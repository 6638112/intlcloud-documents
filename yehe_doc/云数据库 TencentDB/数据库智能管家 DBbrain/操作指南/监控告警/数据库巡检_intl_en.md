Database inspection is used to automate full instance health checks regularly. You can also set up custom inspections based on your own needs to help troubleshoot potential instance issues and provide solutions.
>?Currently, database inspection is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the basic single-node instance).

Log in to the [DBbrain console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/patrol), select **Monitoring & Alarm** > **Database Inspection** on the left sidebar, and select a database type at the top.

## Database Inspection List
The database inspection list displays a summary of inspection information generated by the database instance, such as basic instance information, health level, the number of slow queries, and the number of big tables.

 - You can select last 1 day, last 3 days, last 7 days or any time period to view the full instance inspection information. You can also perform fuzzy search by instance ID, health level, etc.
