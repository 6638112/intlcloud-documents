The full instance monitoring page gives you an overview of the database monitoring metrics of all instances. The unified monitoring view displays the cross-sectional view of single monitoring metrics of all instances, allowing you to view and detect database exceptions and providing you with a new macro point of view on monitoring information.

>Currently, the full instance monitoring feature is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the Basic Edition).

Log in to the [DBbrain Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/monitor) and select **Full Instance Monitoring** on the left sidebar.

### Grid switch
You can switch between 9-grid view and 36-grid view. You are recommended to use the 36-grid view if you have many instances, as it provides a broader view.
