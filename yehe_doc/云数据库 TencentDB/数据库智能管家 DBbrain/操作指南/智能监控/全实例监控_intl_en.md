The unified monitoring view displays the cross-sectional view of single metrics of all instances, enabling you to view and detect database exceptions and providing a new holistic point of view for monitoring information.

## Switching Grid
You can switch between 9-grid view and 36-grid view. We recommend you use the 36-grid view if the number of instances is high, as it provides a broader view and you can view the fluctuations of monitoring metrics more clearly.
