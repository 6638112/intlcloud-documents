This document describes how to manage instances in the [DBbrain Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dbbrain/analysis). This document uses the **Instance List** and **Exception Alarm** pages as examples to introduce DBbrain's management features.
>Currently, this feature is supported only for TencentDB for MySQL (excluding the Basic Edition).

## Instance List
The **Instance List** page displays the information of the database instances currently supporting DBbrain. Basic information such as the instance names, IDs and statuses of the database instances as well as their connection sources, groups, exception alarms, health scores, and operations can be found here.
- In the **Group** column, you can select the default group or custom create a group. You can also select one or multiple instances in the instance list and click **Manage Group** at the top to switch them to another group or add them to a new group.
- The **Exception Alarm** column displays the number of exceptions of the instance detected by **24/7 Exception Diagnosis**. You can click to view more details.
- The **Health Score** column displays the instance health score (the higher the score, the healthier the instance) rated during periodic health checks.
- In the **Operation** column, select **Diagnosis and Optimization** to access the specific feature details page and view the instance operation status.
