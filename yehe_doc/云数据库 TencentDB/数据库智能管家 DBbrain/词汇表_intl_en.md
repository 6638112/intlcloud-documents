### Performance Metric
Performance metrics reflect the performance of a database instance, including but not limited to CPU utilization, memory utilization, storage utilization, network traffic, number of database connections, transaction rate/database throughput, submission latency, storage latency, storage IOPS, storage throughput, and storage queue depth.

### Network Traffic
Network traffic refers to the network transfer throughput, which is the rate of the inbound and outbound network traffic of the database instance per second (in MB).

### Throughput
Throughput refers to the number of bytes passed in or out of the disk per second. This metric is reported as the average throughput over a specified time period.

### Database Instance
A database instance is a standalone database environment running in the cloud, which can contain multiple databases created by users and be accessed via the same client tools and applications as those for a standalone database instance.

### Database Engine
Supported by each database instance, database engine is the core service for storing, processing, and protecting data. It allows you to control access permissions and process transactions quickly to meet the enterprise requirements of most applications that need to process massive amounts of data. 

### DBA
A database administrator (DBA) is responsible for managing (e.g. storing and organizing) data using specialized software. The responsibilities of a DBA include but are not limited to database capacity planning, installation, configuration, database design, migration, performance monitoring, security, troubleshooting, and backup and data restoration.

### High Availability
High availability refers to the ability of a system to function properly without interruptions and represents the systemâ€™s degree of availability.

### QPS
Queries per second (QPS) is a metric measuring how much traffic is processed by a particular query server within the specified time period.

### TPS
Transactions per second (TPS) is the number of transactions a system can process per second. It is a key metric for evaluating the system's processing capabilities.
