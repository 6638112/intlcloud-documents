As the distributed architecture of a distributed database is imperceptible to the user, in general, only the table structure needs to be created in advance, and you can then migrate data using a MySQL client such as mysqldump, Navicat, or SQLyog in the following steps:

Step 1. Prepare the import and export environments
Step 2. Export the table structure and data of the source table
Step 3. Modify the statement for table creation and create a table structure in the target table
Step 4. Import data

## Step 1. Prepare the import and export environments
Before migrating data, you need to get the following prepared:
- A CVM instance
	- The specification of 2 CPU cores, 8 GB memory, and 500+ GB disk capacity (depending on data volume) is recommended
	- Linux
	- MySQL client installed
	- If the data volume is small (less than 10 GB), you can also import it directly over the public network (internet) with nothing prepared
- TDSQL
	- Select a capacity as expected and perform initialization according to the source database character set, table name case sensitivity, and value of `innodb_page_size`.
	- Create an account with all global permissions enabled (recommended)
	- Enable a public IP address if necessary

## Step 2. Export the table structure and data of the source table
### Demonstration environment
- Manipulated database: caccts
- Manipulated table: t_acct_water_0
- Source database: single-instance MySQL
- Target database: TDSQL for Percona or MariaDB

### Exporting table structure from source database
Run `mysqldump -u username -p password -d dbname tablename > tablename.sql` to export the table structure
```
// Command instance
mysqldump -utest -ptest1234 -d -S /data/4003/prod/mysql.scok caccts t_acct_water_0 > table.sql
```

### Exporting table data from source database
Run `mysqldump -c -u username -p password dbname tablename > tablename.sql` to export the table data.
```
// Command instance
mysqldump -c -t -utest -ptest1234  -S /data/4003/prod/mysql.scok caccts t_acct_water_0 > data.sql
```
>Data must be exported using mysqldump with the `-c` parameter appended, because only in this way can all the exported data rows have a column name field. SQL data rows with no column name field will be rejected by TDSQL for Percona or MariaDB. `-t` indicates to export the table data only but not the table structure.

### Uploading files to directory on CVM instance
Before uploading files, you need to enable the public IP address of the CVM instance. Then, upload at least the following files just exported as instructed in [Uploading Files to Linux CVM Through SCP](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/2133):
- Table structure SQL: table.sql
- Data SQL: data.sql

## Step 3. Modify the statement for table creation and create a table structure in the target table
Open the exported table structure file `table.sql`, add the primary key and shardkey through statements like the following ones, and save it as `tablenew.sql`.
```
CREATE TABLE（
column name 1 data type,
column name 2 data type,
column name 3 data type,
....，
PRIMARY KEY('column name n'))
ENGINE=INNODB DEFAULT CHARSET=xxxx 
shardkey=keyname
```
>Primary key and shardkey must be set. Pay attention to the table name case sensitivity. You are recommended to delete redundant comments; otherwise, the table may not be created successfully.

## Step 4. Import data
### Connecting to TDSQL for Percona or MariaDB instance
On the CVM instance, run `mysql -u username -p password -h IP -P port ` to log in to the MySQL server, and run `use dbname` to enter the database.
>You may need to create a database first.

### Importing table structure
Use the uploaded files to import data by running the `source` command.
1. First, import the table structure: `source /file path/tablenew.sql`
2. Then, import the data: `source /file path/data.sql`
3. Verify the import result: `select  count(*) from tablename`

>You need to import the table creation statements first and then import the data. You can also import the .sql files directly through MySQL's `source` command.

## Other Solutions
Generally, you can import data smoothly as long as you have created the corresponding table structure with the shardkey specified in the target table before importing data.
