## Feature Description
An SQL statement query that takes more time than the specified value is referred to as a "slow query", and the corresponding statement is called a "slow query statement". The process where a database administrator (DBA) analyzes slow query statements and finds out the reasons why slow queries occur is known as "slow query analysis".

Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb), click an instance name in the instance list to enter the management page, and select the **Performance Optimization** > **Slow Query Analysis** tab where you can perform slow query analysis.

>!Currently, slow query analysis can only be performed and viewed in each shard separately.

## Descriptions of main parameters
### Main default settings
-   Slow query feature: enabled by default.
-   Slow query time (long_query_time): 1 second by default, that is, only slow query statements that exceed 1 second will be logged.
-   Analyzed data output latency: 1-5 minutes.
-   Logging duration: 30 days, depending on the backup and log settings.

### Descriptions of analysis list fields
-   Checksum (checksum): a sequence of digits used to identify a slow query statement (64-bit by default).
-   Abstracted slow query statement (fingerprint): slow query statement with user data hidden.
-   Database: the database in which a slow query statement occurs.
-   Account: the account under which a slow query statement occurs.
-   Last execution time (last_seen): the time when a slow query statement last occurred within the time range.
-   First execution time (first_seen): the time when a slow query statement first occurred within the time range.
-   Total number of occurrences (ts_cnt): number of occurrences of a slow query statement within the time range.
-   Occurrence percentage: occurrence percentage of a slow query statement in relation to all slow query statements within the time range.
-   Total time (query_time_sum): total time of a slow query statement within the time range.
-   Total time percentage: total time percentage of a slow query statement within the time range.
-   Average time (query_time_avg): average time calculated by dividing the total time of a slow query statement with total number of occurrences.
-   Minimum time (query_time_min): minimum occurrence time of a slow query statement.
-   Maximum time (query_time_max): maximum occurrence time of a slow query statement.
-   Total lock time (lock_time_sum): total lock time of a slow query statement.
-   Total lock time percentage: time percentage of a slow query statement in relation to total slow query statement lock time within the time range.
-   Average lock time (lock_time_avg): average time calculated by dividing total slow query statement lock time with total number of locks.
-   Minimum lock time (lock_time_min): minimum slow query statement lock time.
-   Maximum lock time (lock_time_max): maximum slow query statement lock time.
-   Number of rows sent (Rows_sent_sum): total number of data rows sent by a slow query statement.
-   Number of rows scanned (Rows_examined_sum): total number of data rows scanned by a slow query statement.
