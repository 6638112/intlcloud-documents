## Read/Write Separation Based on Read-only Account
1. Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb). In the instance list, click an instance name or **Manage** in the "Operation" column to enter the instance management page.
2. Select the **Manage Account** tab and click **Create**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, set the account information, set **Create as read-only account** to **Yes**, and click **Confirm and Go Next**.
4. In the pop-up dialog box, you can set **Read-Only Request Allocation Policy** to define the read policy when a secondary server failure (or long delay) occurs and configure the " Read-Only Secondary Server Delay Parameter", and then click **OK**.
 - Select **Primary Server** to read from the primary server when the delay of secondary server exceeds the limit.
 - Select **Report Errors** to report an error when the delay of secondary server exceeds the limit.
 - Select **Read Only from Secondary Server** to ignore the delay parameter and always read from the secondary server (this is generally used to pull binlogs for sync).
 - Set the **Read-Only Secondary Server Delay Parameter** to define the data sync delay threshold, which is used together with **Primary Server** and **Report Errors** under the **Read-Only Request Allocation Policy**.

## Read/Write Separation Based on Comment
Add the `/*slave*/` field before each SQL statement to be "read" by the secondary server, and add the `-c` parameter after "mysql" to parse the comment, such as `mysql -c -e "/*slave*/sql"`, to automatically assign "read" requests to the secondary server. Below are examples:
```
//Read from the primary server//
select * from emp order by sal，deptno desc；
//Read from the secondary server//
/*slave*/ select * from emp order by sal，deptno desc；
```
>!
>- This feature only supports read from the secondary server (SELECT) rather than other operations. Non-SELECT statements will fail.
>- The `-c` parameter needs to be added after `mysql` to parse the comment.
>- ```/*slave*/``` must be in lowercase, and no spaces are needed before and after the statement.
>- If the MAR (strong sync) mechanism is affected by a secondary server exception, read from the secondary server will be automatically switched to read from the primary server.
