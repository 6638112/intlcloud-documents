This document describes how to create an instance in the TDSQL Console.

## Directions
1. Log in to the [TDSQL Purchase Page](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb/buy), select a region, specify region, network type, shard specifications, etc., and click **Buy Now**.
 - For more information, please see [Instance Architecture](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33319), [Shard Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/33354), and [Pricing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1042/35777).
 - The networks of Tencent Cloud services in different regions cannot communicate with one another.
 - Once selected, a VPC cannot be changed. For more information on VPC operations, see [Managing VPC Instances](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/31805).
