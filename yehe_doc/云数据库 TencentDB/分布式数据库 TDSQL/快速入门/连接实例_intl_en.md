## Connection Methods
You can connect to a TDSQL for MySQL instance in the following ways:
- **Private network connection**: a CVM instance can be used to connect to the private network address of a TencentDB instance. This method relies on the high-speed private network of Tencent Cloud and features low delay.
 - The two instances must be under the same account and in the same [VPC](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535) in the same region, or both in the classic network.
 - The private network address is provided by TencentDB by default and can be viewed in the instance list or on the instance details page in the [TDSQL for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/tdmysql-instance/index).
>?CVM and TencentDB instances in different VPCs (under the same or different accounts in the same or different regions) can be interconnected over private network through [Cloud Connect Network](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/1003).
>
- **Public network connection**: if you cannot access the private network, you can connect to your TDSQL for MySQL instance at its public network address. The public network address needs to be [manually enabled](#waiwang). It can be viewed on the instance details page in the [TDSQL for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld/tdmysql-instance/index) and can be disabled if no longer needed.
 - Enabling the public network address will expose your database services to the public network, which may lead to database intrusions or attacks. We recommend that you use the private network to connect to the database. 
 - Public network connection to TencentDB is suitable for development or auxiliary management of databases but not for business access in the production environment, as potentially uncontrollable factors may lead to unavailability of the public network connection, such as DDoS attacks and bursts of high-traffic access.

## Preparations
### Creating an account
1. Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb). In the instance list, click an instance ID/name or **Manage** in the **Operation** column to access the instance management page.
2. Select the **Account Management** tab and click **Create**.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/148943eb024c9d3871b3c5d509de2e20.png)
3. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the account name, host, password, and remarks. After confirming that everything is correct, click **OK**.
The host name is actually the network egress address. If needed, you can enter % to indicate that this instance is accessible to every IP.
4. In the permission modification dialog box, after assigning permissions based on needs, click **Save Settings** to complete the permission assignment. If you need to set permissions later, click **Set Later**.
The navigation bar on the left provides a graphical interface fully compatible with MySQL management. Permissions can be managed at the column level.

5. Return to the account list, click **Modify Permissions** to modify user permissions, click **Clone Account** to completely copy the current account permissions to create a new account. Click **More** to reset the password and delete the account.

### Enabling the public network address (optional)
1. Log in to the [TDSQL for MySQL console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dcdb), click an instance ID/name in the instance list to enter the instance details page, and click **Enable** next to **Public IP** in the **Basic Info** section.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/71a29582f85cbda585ed586341f9b351.png)
2. After the successful enablement, you can view the public network address and port number next to **Public IP**. TDSQL for MySQL assigns a unique pair of public IP and port to each instance.


After creating an account and obtaining the public/private network address, you can connect to TDSQL for MySQL through third-party tools and program drivers.
- On Windows, connection methods of command line, client, and JDBC driver are taken as examples.
- On Linux, connection method of command line is taken as an example.

## Connecting from a Windows Device
### Connecting with Windows command lines
1. Open the Windows command line tool, and enter the following commands under the correct path of mysql.
```
mysql -h public/private IP -P port number -u username  -p
Enter password: **********
```
2. If the following information is displayed, the database is connected successfully, and you can operate it.
```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
```

### Connecting with the Windows client
1. Download a standard SQL client such as MySQL Workbench and SQLyog. Here we take SQLyog as an example.
2. Open SQLyog, select **File** > **New Connection**, enter host address, port, username and password, and click **Connect**.
 - **MySQL Host Address**: enter the public/private IP of the instance obtained earlier.
 - **Username**: enter the account name created earlier.
 - **Password**: enter the password of the account. If you forgot the password, reset it in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tdsqld).
 - **Port**: enter the port number of the instance obtained earlier.
3. The interface after successful connection is as shown below. You can operate the database in this interface.

### Connecting with the Windows JDBC driver
TDSQL for MySQL supports connecting with program drivers. This document uses Java JDBC Driver for MySQL (Connector/J) as an example.

1. [Download](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/5.0.html) a JDBC jar package from the MySQL official website, and import it to the library referenced in Java.
2. Run the following code to call JDBC:
```
public static final String url = "public/private network address";
public static final String name = "com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"; // Call JDBC
public static final String user = "username";
public static final String password = "password";
//JDBC
Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"); 
Connection conn=DriverManager.getConnection("url, user, password");
//
conn.close();
```
3. After the connection is successful, you can perform other operations on the database.
>?Because TDSQL for MySQL needs to specify the shardkey when sharding and inserting data, these operations cannot be called with JDBC.

## Connecting from a Linux Device
### Connecting with Linux command lines
This document takes CentOS 7.2 64-bit on a CVM instance as an example. For more information on CVM instance purchase, please see [Purchasing Channels](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/506).
1. Log in to the Linux CVM, enter `yum install mysql`, and download and install the MySQL client from Tencent Cloud's image source with CentOS's package management software Yum.
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/fe1470a47fd3311460a7cfd24f70a88a.png)
2. When `complete` is displayed on the command line, the MySQL client is successfully installed.
3. Enter `mysql -h public/private IP -P port -u username -p` to connect to TDSQL for MySQL. Then, you can perform sharding.
Below uses `show databases;` as an example:
