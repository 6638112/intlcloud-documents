This document provides a simple example that walks you through how to pull a table from data subscription to a local file system as well as a simple [Local Demo](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/f145138da95d16063a3219f030f24625/LocalDemo.zip). The following operations are performed on CentOS.

## Configuring Environment
- Java environment configuration
```
 yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel 
```
- [Download the data subscription SDK](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/2aa7b213535065def5655712c8494182/binlogsdk-2.7.0-official.jar)

## Getting Key
Log in to the [CAM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/capi) to get a key.

## Selecting Data Subscription
1. Log in to the [DTS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dtsnew/migrate/page) and select **Data Subscription** on the left sidebar to enter the data subscription page.
2. Select the name of the TencentDB instance to be synced, click "Start", return to the data subscription page, and click the data subscription you created. For detailed directions, please see [How to Get a Data Subscription](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/571/8774).
3. Check the corresponding DTS channel, IP, and port and enter them together with the obtained key into the corresponding `LocalDemo.java`.
```
  // // Enter the key obtained from TencentCloud API here
        context.setSecretId("AKIDfdsfdsfsdt1331431sdfds"); Enter the `secretID` obtained from TencentCloud API
        context.setSecretKey("test111usdfsdfsddsfRkeT"); Enter
        the `secretKey` obtained from TencentCloud API
	// Enter the IP and port obtained through data subscription in the DTS service here
        context.setServiceIp("10.66.112.181"); Enter the IP obtained from the data subscription configuration
        context.setServicePort(7507);
        Enter the port obtained from the data subscription configuration
        final DefaultSubscribeClient client = new DefaultSubscribeClient(context);
	// Enter the names of both the database and table to be synced and modify the name of the file where they will be stored
        final String targetDatabase = "test"; Enter the name of the database to subscribe to
        final String targetTable = "alantest"; Enter the name of the table to subscribe to

        final String fileName = "test.alan.txt"; Enter the name of the local file for storage
        
          client.addClusterListener(listener);
	// Enter the `dts-channel` configuration information obtained from the data subscription configuration here
	client.askForGUID("dts-channel-e4FQxtYV3It4test"); Enter the DTS channel name obtained from the data subscription
        client.start();
```


## Compiling and Testing
1. 
```
[root@VM_71_10_centos ~]# javac -classpath binlogsdk-2.6.0-release.jar -encoding UTF-8 LocalDemo.java
```
2. Launch the program. If no errors are reported, the program works properly. Check the local file previously configured.
```
java -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit -Xms2g -Xmx2g -classpath .:binlogsdk-2.6.0-release.jar LocalDemo
```
3. Check the `test.alan.txt` file previously configured and you can see that data has been pulled into it.
```
[root@VM_71_10_centos ~]# cat test.alan.txt
