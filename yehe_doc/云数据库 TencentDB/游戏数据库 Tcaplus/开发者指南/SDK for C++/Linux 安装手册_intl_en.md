## Operation Scenarios
This document describes how to install and use a TcaplusDB PB table on Linux.

## Runtime Environment
Linux 2.6 and SUSE 12 64-bit.

## Prerequisites
Before installing and using TcaplusDB PB, you need to install Protobuf. Currently, TcaplusDB supports Protobuf v2.6.1 and v3.5.0.
Protobuf is a cross-language lightweight structured data storage format launched by Google. TcaplusDB supports defining data tables with Protobuf definition files (.proto). Before using a TcaplusDB PB API, you need to install Protobuf on your development server first. You are recommended to use the source code to install Protobuf in the following steps:
1. Prepare the CVM instance environment.
You need a server on which CentOS 6 or 7 on the x86_64 architecture has been installed. To compile and construct Protobuf, you also need to install the following programs accordingly:
 - Autoconf
 - Automake
 - Libtool
 - cURL (used to download Google Mock)
 - Make
 - g++
 - Unzip
2. Download the Protobuf source code installation package. For more information, please see [SDK Download](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1016/30285).
3. Please install an appropriate version of Protobuf based on your actual needs. The following steps use Protobuf 2.6.1 as an example:
4. Run the following command to decompress the source code installation package and enter the source code root directory:
```
tar -xzvf protobuf-2.6.1.tar.gz
cd ./protobuf-2.6.1
```
5. Configure and specify the installation path prefix. You are recommended to install it under `/usr/local/protobuf`.
```
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/protobuf
```
6. Compile and install it.
```
make
make check
make install
```
6. Perform the test. Run the `protoc` command to check whether the installation succeeded. If the following information is displayed, the installation is successful.
```
# protoc --version
libprotoc 2.6.1
```

## Directions
### Step 1: Installing SDK 
Download the SDK onto the development server and run the following command to install the file to the specified installation directory:
```
tar â€“xzf <installation package path> -C <installation directory>,
```

### Step 2: Verifying
After the installation, the root directory structure is as shown below:

| Directory and File | Description |
|---------|---------|
| include/tcaplus_service/ | TcaplusDB service API header file |
| lib/libtcaplusserviceapi.a | TcaplusDB service API library file |
| include/tcaplus_service/protobuf/ | Protobuf API header file |
| lib/libtcaplusprotobufapi.a | TcaplusDB Protobuf API library file |
| examples/tcaplus/ProtoBuf | TcaplusDB Protobuf API sample |

### Step 3: Running `example` and accessing TcaplusDB
You can develop the corresponding data access logic on the GameSvr game server by referring to API samples in `example`.

1. Decompress the TcaplusDB PB API release package.
```
tar -xzvf TcaplusPbApi3.36.0.152096.x86_64_release_20170712.tar.gz
```
2. Configure the TcaplusDB system connection information.
	1. Enter the following code on the command line to enter the directory:   
```
cd TcaplusPbApi3.36.0.152096.x86_64_release_20170712/release/x86_64/examples/tcaplus/C++_common_for_pb2
```
	2. On the command line, enter `vi common.h` to modify the `common.h` header file. Modify the content in the figure below based on your actual business needs:
	DIR_URL_ARRAY: cluster access IP address and port.
	DIR_URL_COUNT: value fixed at 1.
	TABLE_NAME: target table to be accessed.
	APP_ID: target access ID.
	ZONE_ID: ID of the table group to be accessed.
	SIGNATURE: cluster access password.

3. Modify the environment configuration file.
In the `TcaplusPbApi3.36.0.152096.x86_64_release_20170712/release/x86_64/examples/tcaplus` directory, there are sample files of calling APIs asynchronously or by using a coroutine. This step uses calling the `Set` API with a coroutine to set data as an example.
Enter the following code on the command line to enter the directory:
```
cd TcaplusPbApi3.18.0.152096.x86_64_release_20170712/release/x86_64/examples/tcaplus/C++_pb2_coroutine_simpletable/SingleOperation/set
```
All code of the example of calling the `Set` API with a coroutine is in the directory. Modify the `envcfg.env` file, set the `PROTOBUF_HOME` environment variable to the Protobuf installation path on this server (specified by `--prefix`), and set the `TCAPLUS_HOME` environment variable to the absolute path of the `release/x86_64` directory in the TcaplusDB PB API package as shown below:

4. Run the following command under the code directory to set the environment variables:
```
source envcfg.env
bash conv.sh
```
5. Compile the binary program.
Run the `make` command to compile the binary program of `example`. After the compilation succeeded, a `mytest` executable file will be generated.

6. Run the binary program.
On the command line, enter `./mytest` to run the binary program. The execution result will be displayed in the command line standard output. If any error occurs, please check the `tcaplus_pb.log` log file in the code directory.
