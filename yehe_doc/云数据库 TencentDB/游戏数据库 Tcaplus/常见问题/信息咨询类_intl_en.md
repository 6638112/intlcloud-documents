### Does TcaplusDB support multi-table transaction operations and batch write operations?

For example, when multiple operations are submitted at the same time, all completed operations are rolled back if one of the subsequent operation fails. After the rollback, you can submit these operations again. For important operations, we recommend keeping the logs.
