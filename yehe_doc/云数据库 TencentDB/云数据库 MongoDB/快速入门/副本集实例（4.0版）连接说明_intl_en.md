The connection method for MongoDB replica set instances (v4.0) is different from that of other versions. 3 IPs are provided on v4.0 for access, corresponding to 3 nodes in a replica set. When connecting your business in a production environment, you are recommended to configure 3 IPs in the connection string to make the connection more secure and efficient.

>If only the IP of the master node is configured in the connection string, your business may face a read-only connection risk when a master/slave switchover occurs in the instance.

## Getting Connection String
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb), purchase a replica set instance (v4.0), and perform [initialization](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/240/7090).
2. In the instance list, click an instance name to enter the instance details page, click **Copy connection string** in the private address section to get the connection string of the instance for connecting to the replica set instance.
Below is a sample connection string:
```
mongodb://mongouser:******@192.168.x.xx:27017,192.168.x.xx:27017,192.168.x.xx:27017/admin?authSource=admin&replicaSet=cmgo-7oiab5db_0
```
