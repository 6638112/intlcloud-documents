## Operation Scenarios
Maintenance time is a very important concept for TencentDB for MongoDB. To ensure the stability of your TencentDB for MongoDB instance, the backend system performs maintenance operations on the instance during the maintenance window from time to time. It is highly recommended that you set an acceptable maintenance time for your business instance, usually during off-peak hours, so as to minimize the potential impact on your business.


## Directions
1. Log in to the [TencentDB for MongoDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb/). In the instance list, find the instance to be modified and click the instance name or **More** > **Manage** in the "Operation" column.
2. In the "Maintenance Time" section on the instance details page, click **Modify**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, select the maintenance time and click **Confirm** to set the instance maintenance time.
