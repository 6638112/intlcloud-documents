TencentDB for MongoDB supports assigning instances to different projects for management.

Below are some points that need your attention:
- Assigning and moving database instances across projects will not affect the services provided by the instances.
- You need to specify a project to which a new instance belongs when purchasing it. The default project is **Default Project**.
- Assigned instances can be reassigned to other projects through the **Assign to Project** feature in the [console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb/sharding).
