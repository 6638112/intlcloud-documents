## Monitoring Granularity
TencentDB for MongoDB does not support customizing monitoring granularity. The adaptive monitoring policy is as follows:

| Time Span | Monitoring Granularity | Retention Period |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 0–2 days | 1 minute | 2 days |
| 2–7 days | 5 minutes | 7 days |
| 7–30 days | 1 minute | 30 days |

## Types of Instances for Monitoring
TencentDB for MongoDB master, read-only, and disaster recovery instances can be monitored, and each instance is provided with a separate monitoring view for easy query.

## Monitoring Metrics

Cloud Monitor provides the following monitoring metrics for TencentDB for MongoDB instances:

| Metric Name | Metric | Unit | Dimension | Description |
