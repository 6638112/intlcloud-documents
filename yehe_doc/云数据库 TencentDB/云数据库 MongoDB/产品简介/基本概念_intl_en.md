TencentDB for MongoDB involves the following concepts:

**Instance**: a standalone database environment running in Tencent Cloud. A TencentDB instance includes multiple databases created by users.

**Replica set**: a primary-secondary cluster supporting automatic failover and consisting of a primary node and one or more secondary nodes.

**Sharded cluster**: a sharded cluster consists of components such as shards, proxy sets, and config servers. Each shard contains a subset of sharded data. Each shard in TencentDB for MongoDB is deployed as a replica set.

[**VPC**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/535): a logically isolated custom virtual network space in Tencent Cloud.

[**Security group**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/31945): security access control to TencentDB for MongoDB instances by specifying IP, protocol, and port rules for instance access.

[**Region and availability zone**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/239/4106): physical location of a TencentDB for MongoDB instance and other resources.

[**Tencent Cloud console**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdb): web-based UIs.

[**Project**](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/34726): projects enable developers to better manage Tencent Cloud services based on the concept of projects by assigning different Tencent Cloud services to different projects.
