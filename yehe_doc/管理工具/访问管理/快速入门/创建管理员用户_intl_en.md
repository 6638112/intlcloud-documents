>- The sub-user created in this way has the admin permissions by default (that is, it is bound to the `AdministratorAccess` policy).
>- You can modify the user information by clicking the ![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/565d4957e8bb8eac6e0348c951da2f7e.png) icon. If the bound policy is not `AdministratorAccess`, the newly created sub-user does not have the admin permissions.
>- For more information on user permissions, please see documents related to [policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/32669).
4. Click **Create User**. You will be redirected to the page prompting that the user is successfully created, and you can get the sub-user information in the following two methods:
	- Click **Copy** to directly get and copy the login information of the sub-user.
	- Click **Send**, enter the email address, and the system will send the complete sub-user information to the specified email address.
5. At this point, user creation has been completed, and the newly created user will be displayed in the user list.
