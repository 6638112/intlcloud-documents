### How do I grant a sub-account specific operation permissions of specific products?
You can [create a custom policy](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/35596), select the products and operations you need, and [associate the policy with the user](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602). After association, your sub-account will be able to manage the resources under the root account within the scope of permissions you set.

### How do I reset a sub-account’s password?
For more information on how to change a sub-user’s password, please see [Resetting Login Passwords for Sub-Users](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/32656). For more information on how to change a collaborator’s password, please see [Account Password](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/14623).


### Why can’t a sub-account access certain Tencent Cloud products after it has been authorized with the read-only policy (ReadOnlyAccess)?

The read-only policy (ReadOnlyAccess) only covers read APIs of Tencent Cloud products where the authorization granularity is operation level or resource level. If you access service-level products or the write APIs of operation-level/resource-level products, the prompt for no access will be displayed. For the authorization granularity of Tencent Cloud products, please see [CAM-Enabled Products](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10588).

### Where can I view the API key?
 The API key is the access key. For more information on how to view the root account API key, please see [Root Account Access Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/34228). For more information on how to view the sub-account API Key, please see [Access Key](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/32675).
 
 ### After a sub-account is authorized, which account owns the resources purchased by the sub-account?
 Resources purchased by the sub-account are owned by the root account.
 ### How will the fees incurred by resource purchases made by a sub-account be paid?
 Fees incurred by the sub-account will be deducted from the balance of the root account.

### Why do I get a prompt saying that "The account is not on the whitelist" when creating a policy?

Some of Tencent Cloud products are still in beta, and a few products do not support CAM yet. See [CAM-Enabled Products](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10588) to check whether and at what granularity you can manage permissions of a product in CAM.

If you want to use CAM to manage permissions of a product in beta, please [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### How do I implement fine-grained permission management for project resources?

You can implement fine-grained permission management by using [tags](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/651). 


### How do I grant permissions to allow a sub-account to view only part of my resources?

The following example describes how to allow a sub-account to view only part of the resources:

The enterprise account `CompanyExample` (ownerUin: 12345678) has a sub-account `Developer`. `CompanyExample` wants to allow the sub-account to view only part of its resources in the console.

For example, to allow the sub-account to view in the console two CVM instances `ins-xxx1` and `ins-xxx2` in the `gz` region:

1. Create the following policy by using policy syntax:
```
{
	"version": "2.0",
	"statement": [
	{
		"action": [
			"cvm:DescribeInstances"
		],
		"resource": ["qcs::cvm:gz::instance/ins-xxx1",
		    "qcs::cvm:gz::instance/ins-xxx2"
		],
		"effect": "allow"
	}
    ]
}
```
You can also grant the sub-account a wider permission, such as full access. To grant the sub-account full access to CVM instances in the Guangzhou region, create the following policy:
```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "action": [
                "cvm:*"
                ],
            "resource": "qcs::cvm:gz::*",
            "effect": "allow"
        }
    ]
}
```

2. Associate the policy with the sub-account. For more information on authorization, please see [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602).

Currently, products that **support** read-only permission at the resource level include CVM, TencentDB for MySQL, and TKE.
Other products do not support granting read-only permission of specific resources. A sub-account either has the permission to view all the resources or has no permission to view any resources.
