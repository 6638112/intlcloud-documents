## Concept
Permissions boundary is an advanced feature used by Tencent Cloud to set a permissions boundary for a sub-account/role. After you set a permissions boundary for a sub-account/role, it can only perform operations allowed by both the associated policy and the permissions boundary. A permissions boundary only limits the maximum scope of permissions owned by a sub-account/role, but cannot be used to set permissions for the sub-account/role. For detailed evaluation logic, please see the following figure:

## Use Cases
You can use a preset or custom policy to set permissions for a sub-account/role. This policy is the maximum scope of permissions that the sub-account/role can have. This document describes how to use a permissions boundary to set the maximum scope of permissions for a sub-account.
Suppose a company's Tencent Cloud resource admin needs to set permissions for OPS employees to meet the following requirements:
● The company has two OPS employees, each of whom has a sub-account: ` test1` and `test2` respectively.
● The employee with the sub-account `test1` only needs to manage all COS permissions under the root account.
● The employee with the sub-account `test2` only needs to manage the operation permission for the server with the instance ID of `ins-1` under the root account.
● The company stipulates that all operations on CVM and COS under the root account by sub-accounts must be performed in the IP range of the company (10.217.182.3/24 or 111.21.33.72/24).

10. Click **Set Boundary**.

### Setting permissions for sub-account `test2`

1. Log in to the admin account and create a custom policy syntax named `policygen-2` by referring to the following policy syntax. For more information, please see "Create by Policy Syntax".

```
{
    "version": "2.0",
    "statement": [
        {
            "effect": "allow",
            "resource": [
                "qcs::cvm:gz::instance/ins-1"
            ],
            "action": [
                "name/cvm:*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}

```

2. On the user list page, find the sub-account `test2` and click the user's nickname to enter the user details page.
3. In the policy section, click **Associate Policy** and check the `policygen-2` policy to set the operation permission of the CVM instance named `ins-1` for the sub-account `test2`.
4. In the permissions boundary section, click **Set Boundary** to enter the permissions boundary setting page.
