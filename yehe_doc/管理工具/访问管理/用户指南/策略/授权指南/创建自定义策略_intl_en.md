## Introduction
This document describes how to create a custom policy in different ways. A custom policy allows granular permission division and can flexibly meet your differentiated permission management needs.

## Prerequisites
Log in to the CAM Console and enter the [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy) page.
## Directions
### Creating by policy generator

With a policy created by the policy generator, you can create policy syntax automatically by selecting a service and actions, and defining resources. This method is highly recommended for its simplicity and flexibility.

1. On the policy management page, click **Create Custom Policy** in the top-left corner.
2. In the selection window that pops up, click **Create by Policy Generator**.
3. In the Service and Action selection page, enter the following information:
 > - Service (required): select the product to be added.
> - Action (required): select the actions you want to authorize.
> - Resource (required): enter the six-segment description of the resource to be authorized. For more information, please see [Resource Description Method](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10606).
> - Condition (optional): set the condition that must be met for the created authorization to take effect for the sub-account. For more information, please see [Condition](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10608).

>  
- Actions for certain services do not need to be associated with objects, so there is no need to enter the resource description for them, and you can simply enter `*` as the resource.
- Multiple statements can be added in one policy.

4. Click **Add Statement** > **Next** to enter the policy editing page.
5. On the policy editing page, you can set the policy name, add a description, and confirm the policy content. The policy name and content are automatically generated by the console.

>  
 - The policy name is `policygen` suffixed with the creation time by default, which is customizable.
 - The policy content corresponds to the service and actions selected in step 3. You can modify them as needed.
 
6. Click **Create Policy** to complete the creation of custom policy by using the policy generator.

### Creating by policy syntax
With a policy created by policy syntax, you can set the permission granularity in a more flexible manner, which helps meet high requirements for fine-grained division of permissions.
1. On the policy management page, click **Create Custom Policy** in the top-left corner.
2. In the selection window that pops up, click **Create by Policy Syntax** to go to the policy template page.
3. You can search for templates on this page. For example, set the template type is "All Templates" and enter "a" as a keyword. The `AdministratorAccess` template will appear as one of the searched results. Select this template.
4. Click **Next** to enter the policy editing page.
5. On the policy editing page, confirm the policy name and content and click **Create Policy** to complete the creation of custom policy by using policy syntax. The default policy name and content are automatically generated by the console. The policy name is `policygen` suffixed with the creation time by default.

### Authorizing by tag
Authorization by tag enables you to quickly authorize resources under the same tag to a user or user group.
1. On the policy management page, click **Create Custom Policy** in the top-left corner.
2. In the selection window that pops up, click **Authorize by Tag**.
3. On the authorization by tag page, select the following information and click **Next**.
 - Authorize User/User Group: check the user/user group to be authorized (choose one).
 - Tag Key: select the tag key to be authorized (required).
 - Tag Value: select the tag value to be authorized (required).
 - Resources: the management permission is granted by default.
4. Confirm the policy name and content and click **Complete** to complete the creation of custom policy by using authorization by tag. The default policy name and content are automatically generated by the console. The policy name is `policygen` suffixed with the creation time by default.
