## Introduction
This document describes how to create a policy to resolve a fault by referencing the fault report. After the fault is resolved, the sub-account will be able to manage the resources of the root account within the scope of the newly configured permissions.
## Example
When a sub-account associated with the `QcloudCVMReadOnlyAccess ` policy attempts to reinstall a CVM instance, the following error will be reported:

If you want to authorize the sub-account to proceed with this operation, you can reference this error message to create and associate a custom policy.
## Directions
1. Login to the CAM Console and go to [Policies](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/policy). Click **Create Custom Policy**.
2. In the selection window that pops up, click **Create by Policy Generator**.
3. Fill in the following information in the **Select Service and Action** page. See the following image for reference:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/1a8e8ec417b6577ac54e7167f7d1445b.png)

> - Effect (required): select whether or not the action is allowed. In this example, select **Allow**.
 > - Service (required): select the product based on the abbreviation to authorize. In this example, it is **CVM** corresponding to `cvm` in the `operation` field of the error message.
> - Action (required): select the action to authorize. In this example, select **ResetInstance** corresponding to the `operation` field of the error message.
> - Resource (required): enter the resource description in the six-segment format. In this example, copy and enter `qcs:id/1158313:cvm:ap-guangzhou:uin/2159973417:instance/instance/ins-esuithv2` corresponding to the `resource` field of the error message.
> - Condition (optional): set the conditions that must be met for the permission to take effect, such as a specified access IP. In this example, leave it empty.

4. Click **Add Statement** > **Next** to enter the policy editor page.
5. You can set the policy name, add remarks, and confirm the policy content on this page. The policy name and content are automatically generated by the console.
>  
 - The policy name is `policygen` suffixed with the creation time by default, which is customizable.
 - The policy content corresponds to the service and actions selected in step 3. You can modify them as needed.
6. Click **Create Policy** to complete the creation of custom policy by using the policy generator.
7. Authorize the sub-account as instructed in [Authorization Management](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/10602). After authorization, the sub-account will be granted the needed permission, and the fault will be resolved.
