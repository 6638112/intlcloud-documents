## Overview
This document describes how to set sub-user login password rules to regulate sub-usersâ€™ login password character types, length, and validity period.

## Directions


1. Log in to the CAM console and select **Users** > [User Settings](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/security/subAccount) in the left sidebar.
2. Set the password rule.

>- This password rule applies to the password of a sub-user created via a custom method. For example, if you set the rule to "Should contain at least 10 characters of digits and lowercase letters", the password of the sub-user you created should comply with this rule.
>- This rule does not apply to sub-users that log in via WeCom or collaborators.

Sub-users with the cam:GetPasswordRules permission and the root account can go to **User Settings** in the console and click **Download current password rules** in **Note** to pass the current password rule to the user that needs it, as shown in the following figure:
