Tencent Distributed SQL (TDSQL) is a distributed database service deployed in Tencent Cloud that supports automatic sharding (horizontal splitting) and the Shared Nothing architecture. With a distributed database, your business gets a complete logical database table which is split and distributed evenly across multiple physical shard nodes on the backend. TDSQL deploys the primary/secondary architecture by default and provides a full set of solutions for disaster recovery, backup, restoration, monitoring, and migration, making it ideal for storing terabytes to petabytes of data.

TDSQL operations supported by CloudAudit are as shown below:
