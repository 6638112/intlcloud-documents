Tencent Cloud Storage Gateway (CSG) is a hybrid cloud storage solution that helps organizations and individuals seamlessly connect local storage to a public cloud. It eliminates your concerns over compatibility of multi-protocol local storage devices with cloud storage. Once installed locally, it enables you to achieve a hybrid cloud deployment with massive cloud storage capacity and high performance comparable to local storage.
