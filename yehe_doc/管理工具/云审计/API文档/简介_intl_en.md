Tencent Cloud CloudAudit (CA) allows you to obtain the API calling records of your Tencent Cloud account, including the records of calling APIs through the Tencent Cloud console, Tencent Cloud SDKs, Tencent Cloud CLI, and other Tencent Cloud services. CA monitors all deployment operations in Tencent Cloud. With CA, you can trace API callings, including the sub-users or collaborators who have called the cloud APIs, the source IP addresses from which the APIs were called, and the time when the APIs were called. You can also configure different tracking sets for different logs, and enable or disable logging for the tracking sets at any time.
