Strengths

**1.** **Continuous change monitoring**

With Config Audit, you can continuously monitor the configuration changes of the resources under your Tencent Cloud account. After you set the service monitoring scope and wait for the completion of a short initialization process, the current configuration of your Tencent Cloud resources will be logged, and future resource configuration changes will also be continuously monitored and logged.

**2.** **Centralized change management**

In the Config Audit Console, you can view the configuration change information and the relationships between configuration changes and operation logs in a centralized manner. This helps you stay on top of change details of your Tencent Cloud resources by time and enables you to quickly locate various problems in the operation process.
