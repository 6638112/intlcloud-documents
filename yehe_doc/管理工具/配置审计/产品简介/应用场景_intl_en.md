  **Troubleshooting**

After Config Audit is activated, the system will automatically log the configuration changes of the monitored Tencent Cloud resources and associate the configuration change data with the operation change data in CloudAudit, so you can clearly view the specific operations and configuration change results. If there is a non-compliant change in the resource configuration, you can quickly locate the problem based on the Config Audit data during subsequent troubleshooting.
