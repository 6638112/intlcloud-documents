The increasing number of your Tencent Cloud resources poses higher requirements for resource management. Tencent Cloud has launched the Tag service to allow you to quickly and efficiently query and manage resources. With the Tag service, you can classify and manage existing Tencent Cloud resources and perform resource planning by using preset tags. Tags are words or phrases that act as metadata to identify and organize Tencent Cloud resources. The tag limit varies with the resource, but most resources support up to 50 tags.
