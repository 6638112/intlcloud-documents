### Cloud product monitoring

After purchasing and using a Tencent Cloud product supported by Cloud Monitoring (CM), you can access the [Cloud Monitoring console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor/overview) to view various metrics, such as the product running status, and set alarm rules for monitoring items.

### Custom monitoring

Custom monitoring is used to supplement basic monitoring of cloud products. If CM does not provide the monitoring items you need for a product, you can create a monitoring item to report collected monitoring data to CM. CM also presents the data in charts and uses it to trigger alarms, giving you accurate and real-time knowledge of the state of your business.

### Event monitoring

CM can monitor various Tencent Cloud product resources and important event information in the service lifecycles and operations of the underlying platform infrastructure. You can query event-type report data and set alarms.

### Prompt exception handling

According to your alarm policies, Cloud Monitoring will promptly send you alarm messages when the monitoring data reaches the alarm threshold. This allows you to quickly find the cause of the problem.

### Prompt expansion

After setting alarm rules for bandwidth, connection counts, disk usage, and other monitoring items, you can conveniently keep track of the cloud product status. If your business volume increases, you will promptly receive an alarm and can scale out the relevant services based on the monitoring data.
