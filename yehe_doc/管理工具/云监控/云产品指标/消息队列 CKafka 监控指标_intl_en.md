Tencent Cloud Monitor provides the following monitoring metrics for CKafka instances:

| Metric Name | Parameter | Description | Unit | Dimension |
| ------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- | -------------- |
| Production traffic | pro_flow | Actual production traffic of the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period | MB | Instance |
| Consumption traffic | con_flow | Actual consumption traffic of the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period | MB | Instance |
| Used disk capacity | msg_heap | Total size of persistent messages in the instance, which is the latest value in the selected time period | MB | Instance |
| Produced messages | pro_count | Actual number of messages produced in the instance, which is the total number of messages in the selected time period | - | Instance |
| Consumed messages | con_count | Actual number of messages consumed in the instance, which is the total number of messages in the selected time period | - | Instance |
| Production requests | pro_req_count | Number of production requests at the instance level, which is the total number of requests in the selected time period (1 or 5 minutes) | - | Instance |
| Consumption requests | con_req_count | Number of consumption requests at the instance level, which is the total number of requests in the selected time period (1 or 5 minutes) | - | Instance |
| Persistent messages | msg_count | Total number of persistent messages in the instance, which is the latest value in the selected time period | - | Instance |
| Peak production bandwidth | max_pro_flow | Peak traffic generated when the instance produces messages (excluding traffic generated by replicas) | MB/s | Instance |
| Peak consumption bandwidth | max_con_flow | Peak traffic generated when the instance consumes messages (excluding replica) | MB/s | Instance |
| Disk utilization | disk_usage | Ratio of the currently used disk capacity to the total disk capacity of the instance in percentage | % | Instance |
| Production traffic | pro_flow | Actual production traffic of the topic (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period | MB | Topic |
| Consumption traffic | con_flow | Actual consumption traffic of the topic (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time period | MB | Topic |
| Used disk capacity | msg_heap | Total size of messages in the topic (excluding replicas) that actually use disk capacity, which is the latest value in the selected time period | MB | Topic |
| Produced messages | pro_count | Actual number of messages produced in the topic, which is the total number of messages in the selected time period | - | Topic |
| Consumed messages | con_count | Actual number of messages consumed in the topic, which is the total number of messages in the selected time period | - | Topic |
| Production requests | pro_req_count | Number of production requests at the topic level, which is the total number of requests at the selected time period (1 or 5 minutes) | - | Topic |
| Consumption requests | con_req_count | Number of consumption requests at the topic level, which is the total number of requests at the selected time period (1 or 5 minutes) | - | Topic |
| Persistent messages | msg_count | Total number of actually stored messages in the topic (excluding replicas), which is the latest value in the selected time period | - | Topic |
| Maximum offset of the current partition | max_offset | Maximum offset of the current topic corresponding to the consumer group | - | Consumer group |
| Current consumption offset | offset | Current consumption offset of the consumer group | - | Consumer group |
| Unconsumed messages | unconsume | Number of unconsumed messages in the consumer group | - | Consumer group |
| Unconsumed message size | unconsume_size | Total size of unconsumed messages in the partition corresponding to the consumer group, which is the latest value in the selected time period (1 or 5 minutes) | MB | Consumer group |
