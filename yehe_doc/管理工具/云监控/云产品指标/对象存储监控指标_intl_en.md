## Monitoring Metrics

> ?Because COS uses a generic region, no matter where a bucket is located, please always select "Guangzhou" as `Region` when pulling COS monitoring metric data.
>- Please always select "North China (Guangzhou)" for the `Region` field when pulling data by using [API Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=monitor&Version=2018-07-24&Action=DescribeBaseMetrics).
>- Please always enter "ap-guangzhou" in the `Region` field when pulling data by using an SDK.
