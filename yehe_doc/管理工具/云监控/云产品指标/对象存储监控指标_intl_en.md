## Monitoring Metrics

>? Because Cloud Object Storage (COS) uses a generic region, no matter where a bucket is located, select "Guangzhou" as the `Region` when pulling COS monitoring metric data.
- When pulling data using the [API Explorer](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/api/explorer?Product=monitor&Version=2018-07-24&Action=DescribeBaseMetrics), select "ap-guangzhou" for the `Region` field.
- When pulling data using an SDK, enter "ap-guangzhou" for the `Region` field.
