> - Monitoring metrics of the API gateway support all dimensions. You can choose the dimensions of the monitoring metrics based on the [Dimension Description](#weidu).
> - The statistical granularity (`period`) may vary by metric. The [DescribeBaseMetrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/33882) API can be used to obtain the period supported by each metric.

## Dimensions

</span>

 The API gateway provides the combinations of monitoring data in the following three dimensions: environment, API, and key pair (SecretId and SecretKey).

The following describes how to query the combinations of the API gateway in three dimensions:

#### 1. Values of the input parameters at the environment dimension

&Namespace=QCE/APIGATEWAY
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name=serviceId
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value=<serviceId value>
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Name=environmentName
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value=<Environment name>

#### 2. Values of the input parameters at the API dimension

&Namespace=QCE/APIGATEWAY
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name=serviceId
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value=<serviceId value>
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Name=environmentName
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value=<Environment name>
&Instances.N.Dimensions.2.Name=apiid
&Instances.N.Dimensions.2.Value=<API ID>

#### 3. Values of the input parameters at the key pair dimension (for allowlisted users only)

&Namespace=QCE/APIGATEWAY
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name=serviceId
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value=<serviceId value>
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Name=environmentName
&Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value=<Environment name>
&Instances.N.Dimensions.2.Name=key
&Instances.N.Dimensions.2.Value=<secretid of the key pair>
