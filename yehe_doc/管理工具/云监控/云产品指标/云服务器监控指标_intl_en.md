> 1. Basic metric data (such as CPU and memory) and alarm time (local time of your CVM instance) can be obtained only after the [CVM monitoring component Agent](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6211) is installed. If the local time of you CVM instance is not UTC/GMT+08:00, the time of the monitoring data of the instance will not be the local time (UTC/GMT+08:00) of the instance.
> 2. Ways of installing Agent:
>  - Select Cloud Monitor when purchasing a CVM instance to automatically install Agent.
>  - Manually [install Agent](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6211).
>3. The statistical granularity (`period`) may vary by metric. The [DescribeBaseMetrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/33882) API can be used to get the `period` values supported by each metric.
