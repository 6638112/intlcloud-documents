If you need to use Cloud Monitor to view CVM metric data and generate alarms, the CVM must have Agent installed, which will be used to collect metric data.

>
>- To ensure the reporting of monitoring data, TCP dport 80 must be open to the internet on CVM. Because Agent does not depend on security groups and network ACL for data reporting, there is no need to open their TCP dport 80.
>- You must **log in to the CVM instance** to run the following command and get the Agent installer.

## Installing on Linux
1. After [logging in to a Linux instance](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/213/5436), run the following commands:
