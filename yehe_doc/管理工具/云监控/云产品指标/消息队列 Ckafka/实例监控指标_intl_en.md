## Monitoring Metrics

| Parameter | Metric Name | Description | Unit | Dimension |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| InstanceMsgHeap | Used disk capacity | Used instance disk capacity (including the capacity for replicas), which is the latest value in the selected time granularity | MB | instanceId |
| InstanceProCount | Number of messages produced | Number of messages produced in the instance, which is the total number of messages in the selected time granularity | Count | instanceId |
| InstanceConCount | Number of consumed messages | Number of messages consumed in the instance, which is the total number of messages in the selected time granularity | Count | instanceId |
| InstanceProReqCount | Number of production requests | Number of production requests in the instance, which is the total number of requests in the selected time granularity | Count | instanceId |
| InstanceConReqCount | Number of consumption requests | Number of consumption requests in the instance, which is the total number of requests in the selected time granularity | Count | instanceId |
| InstanceMsgCount | Number of persistent messages | Total number of messages stored in the instance disk (excluding replicas), which is the latest value in the selected time granularity | Count | instanceId |
| InstanceProFlow | Produced traffic | Production traffic in the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time granularity | MB/min | instanceId |
| InstanceConFlow | Consumed traffic | Consumption traffic in the instance (excluding traffic generated by replicas), which is the total traffic in the selected time granularity | MB/min | instanceId |
| InstanceDiskUsage | Disk utilization | Instance disk utilization | None. This metric indicates the ratio of the currently used disk capacity to the total disk capacity | instanceId |
| InstanceMaxConFlow | Peak consumption bandwidth | Peak bandwidth traffic generated when the instance consumes messages (no replicas in this case) | MB/s | instanceId |
| InstanceMaxProFlow | Peak production bandwidth | Peak bandwidth traffic generated when the instance produces messages (excluding traffic generated by replicas) | MB/s | instanceId |

> The statistical granularity (`period`) may vary by metric. The [DescribeBaseMetrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/33882) API can be used to obtain the period supported by each metric.

## Overview of the Parameters in Each Dimension

| Parameter Name | Dimension Name | Dimension Description | Format |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name | instanceId | Dimension name of the CKafka instance ID | Enter a string-type dimension name, such as instanceId |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value | instanceId | A specific CKafka instance ID | Enter a specific instance ID, such as ckafka-test |

## Input Parameters

To query the monitoring data of a CKafka instance, use the following input parameters:
