## Overview of the Parameters in Each Dimension

| Parameter Name | Dimension Name | Dimension Description | Format |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name | instanceid | Dimension name of the instance ID | Enter a string-type dimension name, such as instanceid |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value | instanceid | A specific instance ID | Enter a specific Redis instance ID, such as tdsql-123456. The specific Redis instance ID can also be an instance string, such as crs-ifmymj41. It can be queried through the CRS instance list API |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Name | clusterid | Dimension name of the shard ID | Enter a string-type dimension name, such as clusterid. <br><li> To pull overall information, do not pass in this parameter. <br><li> To pull shard information, the input parameter must be `clusterid` |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value | clusterid | A specific shard ID | Enter a specific shard ID such as tdsql-123456, which can be obtained by running commands like `cluster nodes` |

## Input Parameters

To query the monitoring data of a TencentDB for Redis instance, use the following input parameters:
