>? The statistical period for the metrics of TDSQL for MySQL can be 60s or 300s. The exact statistical periods supported vary from metric to metric. You can get the periods different metrics support by calling the `DescribeBaseMetrics` API.

## Dimensions and Parameters

| Parameter | Dimension Name | Dimension Description | Format |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name | uuid | Dimension name for the database instance | Enter a string-type dimension name: `uuid` |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value | uuid | The instance’s UUID | Enter an instance UUID, e.g., `tdsqlshard-12345678` |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Name | shardId | Dimension name for an instance shard. You can pass in this parameter to query a shard’s monitoring data. If it is not passed in, all monitoring data of the instance is queried. | Enter a string-type dimension name: `shardId`. |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.1.Value | shardId | An instance shard ID | Enter an instance shard ID, e.g., `shard-0mzlzl89`. |

## Input Parameters

**To query the monitoring data of a TencentDB for TDSQL v3 instance, use the following input parameters:**
&Namespace=QCE/DCDB
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name=uuid
&Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value=<Specific instance uuid>
