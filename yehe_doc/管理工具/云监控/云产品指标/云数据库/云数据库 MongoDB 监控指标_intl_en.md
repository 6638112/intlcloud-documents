| Cpuusage | CPU utilization | CPU utilization | % | target (node ID) |
| Memusage | Memory utilization | Memory utilization | % | target (node ID) |
| Qr | Read request queue length | Number of read requests in the waiting queue | Count | target (node ID) |
| Qw | Write request queue length | Number of write requests in the waiting queue | Count | target (node ID) |
| Netin | Network inbound traffic | Network inbound traffic | MB/s | target (node ID) |
| Netout | Network outbound traffic | Network outbound traffic | MB/s | target (node ID) |

> The statistical granularity (`period`) may vary by metric. The [DescribeBaseMetrics](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/33882) API can be used to obtain the `period` supported by each metric.

## Overview of the Parameters in Each Dimension

| Parameter Name | Dimension Name | Dimension Description | Format |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Name | target | Dimension name of target | Enter a string-type dimension name, such as target |
| Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value | target | Subject to the actual query dimension | See the [value reference table](#dimensions.0.value-.E5.8F.96.E5.80.BC.E5.8F.82.E7.85.A7.E8.A1.A8) |

> **TencentDB for Redis Instances.N.Dimensions.0.Value:**
> Tencent Cloudâ€™s MongoDB is a cluster service. You can use the API to query the monitoring data of MongoDB from three dimensions: "cluster", "replica set", and "node".
> - "Cluster" represents a MongoDB instance that you purchased. You can query the number of read/write requests, the capacity utilization, and the timeout requests of the entire instance through this dimension.
> - The "replica set" dimension can be used to query the internal capacity utilization and the master-slave latency of a replica set in the cluster. A replica set instance contains only one replica set, and each shard of a sharding instance is a replica.
> - The "node" dimension can be used to query information such as the CPU and the memory utilization of a node in a cluster.

### Reference table of dimensions.0.value

| Value Type | Sample Value | Parameter Description |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Instance ID | cmgo-6ielucen | Instance ID, the unique identifier of a MongoDB instance. <br><li>It can be obtained on the [MongoDB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/mongodb)<br><li> or by calling the MongoDB API |
| Replica set ID | <li>cmgo-6ielucen_0<br><li>cmgo-6ielucen_2 | A replica set ID can be obtained by appending "\_index number" to the instance ID. <br>The "index number" starts from 0 and has a maximum value that equals to 1 less than the number of replica sets. A replica set instance has only one replica set so "\_0" should be suffixed. A sharded instance has many shards, each of which is a replica set. For example, for the replica set ID of the third shard, suffix "\_2" |
| Node ID | <li>cmgo-6ielucen_0-node-primary<br><li>cmgo-6ielucen_1-node-slave0<br><li>cmgo-6ielucen_3-node-slave2 | <li>Append "-node-primary" to the replica set ID to obtain the master node ID of the replica set. <br><li>Append "-node-slave node index number" to the replica set ID to obtain the corresponding slave node ID. The "slave node index number" starts from 0 and has a maximum value that equals to 1 less than the number of slave nodes |
