● You can block a special object (such as a frequently alarming pod) in a specific monitoring dimension.


## Directions

This document describes how to [automatically update a monitored object in the dashboard](#step1), [automatically update an alarm object](#step2), and [block a frequently triggered alarm object](#step3) by taking the "TKE monitoring - pod" dimension as an example.



### Automatically updating monitored object in dashboard[](id:step1)

1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitor console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor).
2. Select **Dashboard** > **Dashboard List** > **Create Dashboard** > **Create Chart**.
3. Configure the monitoring chart as detailed below:
 -  **Monitoring Type**: select **Cloud Product Monitoring** here.
 -  **Metric**: select "TKE (New) - pod" as the service and "CPU utilization (%)" as the metric here.
 -  **Filter**: you can filter the objects to be bound to the chart by dimension (such as region, cluster, namespace, and workload).
    -  **Region**: select the region of the monitored object.
    -  **Cluster**: select the cluster of the monitored object.
 -  **Filter**: you need to configure two filters, namely, the namespace and workload balance type, to monitor all pods under the specified workload and to automatically update the monitored object in the dashboard when pods are created/updated frequently, as shown below:

3. Select "TKE (New) - pod" as the policy type and configure the alarm object as detailed below:
   - **Region**: select the region of the monitored object.
   - **Cluster**: select the cluster of the monitored object.
   - **Filter**: you need to configure two filters, namely, the namespace and workload balance type, to monitor all pods under the specified workload and to automatically update the alarm object when pods are created/updated frequently, as shown below:

### Blocking frequently triggered alarm object[](id:step3)

When a pod frequently triggers an alarm, you can block some or all alarm objects under the node as instructed below.

As shown below, you can block some pod alarms by configuring the "!=" operator for the pod name.
