## Overview

Alarms are provided for basic monitoring metrics of **Tencent Cloud services**. You can create alarms to stay informed on the status change of certain metrics. The specific metrics will be monitored for a certain period of time, and alarm notifications will be sent through channels such as SMS and email at specified intervals based on the given threshold.

## Use Cases

To prevent the normal operation of your system from being affected when a monitoring metric reaches a certain value, you can configure alarm rules for these metrics. The system can then automatically check the monitoring data and send alarm notifications to the admin when the monitoring data meets the configured conditions. This helps you stay informed on business exceptions and quickly solve them.
