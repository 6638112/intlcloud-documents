This document describes how to create an alarm policy.

## Use Cases

You can set threshold alarms for the performance consumption metrics of the Tencent Cloud service resources supported by Cloud Monitor. You can also set event alarms for the service status of Tencent Cloud service instances or the underlying platform infrastructure. This way, when an exception occurs, you will promptly receive notifications, which will allow you to take appropriate measures. An alarm policy consists of five required parameters: name, policy type, alarm trigger condition, alarm object, and alarm notification template. You can create alarm policies by following the directions below:

<td>An alarm trigger condition is a semantic condition consisting of metric, comparison, threshold, statistical period, and duration</td>

<tr>
<td>Notification template</td>
 <td>A notification template can be quickly reused for multiple policies, making it suitable for alarm receipt in various use cases. For more information, please see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/38922">Creating Alarm Notification Template</a></td>

## Directions



1. Log in to the [Cloud Monitor Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/monitor).
2. Click **Alarm Configuration** > **Alarm Policy** to enter the alarm policy configuration page.
3. Click **Add** and configure a new alarm policy as shown below:

             <li>It manages instances. Choose a project based on your needs. Then, in "Alarm Object", you can quickly select instances under the project. You can assign Tencent Cloud services to each project based on your business types. If you want to create a project, please see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/zh/document/product/378/34726">Project Management</a>. After creating a project, you can use the console of each Tencent Cloud service to assign projects to resources. Some Tencent Cloud services such as TencentDB for MySQL do not support project assignment. In that case, you can refer to <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236/8460">Specifying Project for Instance</a> to assign projects to the corresponding instances. If you do not have project permissions, please see <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/36744">Cloud Access Management (CAM)</a> to get permissions.</li></td>

        <li>An alarm trigger condition is a semantic condition consisting of metric, comparison, threshold, measurement period, and duration. You can set an alarm threshold according to the trend of metric change in the chart. <br>For example, if the metric is CPU utilization, the comparison is `>`, the threshold is `80%`, the measurement period is `5 minutes`, and the duration is `2 periods`, <br>then data on the CPU utilization of a CVM instance will be collected once every 5 minutes, and an alarm will be triggered if the CPU utilization exceeds 80% for two consecutive periods.
        </li>
    <li>Alarm frequency: you can set a repeated notification policy for each alarm rule. This way, an alarm notification will be sent repeatedly at a specified frequency when an alarm is triggered.<br>Frequency options: do not repeat, once every 5 minutes, once every 10 minutes, at an exponentially increasing interval, and other frequency options.<br><ul><li type="square">An exponentially increasing interval means that a notification is sent when an alarm is triggered the first time, second time, fourth time, eighth time, and so on. In other words, the alarm notification will be sent less and less frequently as time goes on to reduce the disturbance caused by repeated notifications.</li>
      <li>Default logic for repeated alarm notifications: the alarm notification will be sent to you at the configured frequency within 24 hours after an alarm is triggered. After 24 hours, the alarm notification will be sent once every day by default.</li></ul></li>

4. After configuring the above information, click **Save**. The alarm policy will be created successfully.

>? CVM alarms can be sent normally only after the monitoring [Agent](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/248/6211) has been installed on CVM instances and reports monitoring metric data. On the Cloud Monitor page, you can view CVM instances that do not have Agent installed and download the IP address list.
