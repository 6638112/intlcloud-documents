When your account is in arrears, the below process will be followed:
1. When your account drops to negative, you can continue to use CCN service for another 24 hours. We will also continue to bill you for this usage. 
2. After 24 hours, if your account is not topped up to a positive balance, CCN service and billing will automatically be stopped.
3. Within 7 days after automatic shutdown, if your account balance is not greater than 0, CCN service will remain unavailable; if your balance is greater than 0, CCN service can be resumed and billing continues. 
4. If your balance remains negative for more than 7 days after automatic shutdown, the CCN instance will be terminated permanently, and notifications will be sent through email and SMS to the creator of Tencent Cloud account and all collaborators.
