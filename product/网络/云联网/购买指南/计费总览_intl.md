CCN is a pay-as-you-go service. 

- Interconnection of cross-regional network instances incurs fees, so please set bandwidth limits timely.
- Currently, intra-region network instances interconnection below 1 Gbps is free of charge.

## Billing
<span id='moshi'></span>

### Billing Method
Cross-regional CCN interconnection charge is based on monthly used bandwidth and billed by the monthly 95th percentile (average bandwidth value is taken every 5 minutes in a natural month).

**Cross-account Billing:**

- Cross-account billing is the same as same-account billing.
- All the interconnection charges incurred by the cross-account shall be paid by the instance account.

### Billing Formula

**Monthly CCN cost** equals the sum of CCN instances' cross-regional interconnection fees.

**Monthly single-region fee** = the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak for the region \* valid day proportion \* tiered unit price

Where:

- Monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak: the average bandwidth values are collected every 5 minutes and sorted in a descending order. After discarding the highest 5% of values, the next highest value is recorded as the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak.

For example, suppose you used CCN in June and there were 14 days of cross-regional interconnection between region A and B. Because there was one data point every 5 minutes, there were 288 data points in a day (60 min * 24 / 5 min), and a total number of 4032 data points in 14 days  (14 days * 288). 4032 data points are then sorted in a descending order according to corresponding bandwidth values, and the highest 5% are discarded (4032 * 0.05 = 201.6). Then the 202th data point's bandwidth value is deemed as the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak.

- **Valid day proportion**
A valid day refers to a day when the bandwidth value of any 5-minute statistical point is greater than 3 Kbps, and the valid day proportion = the valid days in the month / the natural days in the month.
- **Tiered unit price**
A unit price in the tiered pricing scheme. For example, if the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak is 95 Mbps in a month, then the monthly fees = 95 \* tiered unit price [for 50-100 Mbps].

### Billing Example

Suppose that your CCN instance is associated with network instances in three regions: Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai.

Different from Peering Connection and Direct Connect which are billed based on inter-instance bandwidth, CCN is billed based on inter-region bandwidth. This document uses Guangzhou and Beijing as examples: 
In June, the bandwidth of VPC 1 in Guangzhou to VPC 2 and VPC 3 in Beijing is 50 Mbps, and the bandwidth of the Direct Connect gateway in Guangzhou to VPC 3 is 50 Mbps (as shown below). However, due to the presence of peaks and valleys, the final billable bandwidth between Guangzhou and Beijing will be 50-150 Mbps. If it is assumed to be 120 Mbps, the billable bandwidth generated by CCN between Beijing and Guangzhou is 120 Mbps (for calculation details, see [Billing Method](#moshi)).

Take Guangzhou and Beijing as an example, 
the 95th percentile bandwidth peak bandwidth between Guangzhou and Beijing is 120M. There are 14 valid days of interconnection between Guangzhou and Beijing in June and thus the valid day proportion is 14/30. The tiered unit price should be the price for 120M, which is 13 USD/Mbps/month. Therefore, the total charge between Guangzhou and Beijing in June equals to 95th percentile bandwidth peak (120M) * valid day proportion (14/30) * tiered unit price (13 USD/Mbps/month)= 728 USD

Fees for other regions are calculated in a similar way (Guangzhou-Shanghai: 1036 USD; Beijing-Shanghai: 518 USD). The final CCN cost is the sum of the inter-region interconnection fees: 728 + 1036 + 518 = 2282 USD.

## Pricing Overview
CCN is pay-per-use based on the monthly 95th percentile bandwidth peak. The corresponding tiered unit prices of the specific bandwidth used in each region are as shown in the following table:
