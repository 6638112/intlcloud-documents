After a cross-account VPC is successfully added to CCN, you can cancel the cross-account association on both the VPC and CCN ends.
>**Note:**
After one party is disassociated, the connection will be interrupted. Please do so with cautions.

## Method 1: Disassociation on the CCN End
1. Log in to the [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/) and select **Products** > **Cloud Compute & Network** > **Virtual Private Cloud** to enter the VPC Console. 
2. Click **Cloud Connect Network** in the left pane to enter the management page. 
3. In the list, click the ID of the CCN to be disassociated to enter the details page. 
4. On the **Associated instances** page, find the row of the network instance to be disassociated, click **Disassociate** in the "Operation" column and then click "OK".
