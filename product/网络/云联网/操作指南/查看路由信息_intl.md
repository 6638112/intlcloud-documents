>**Note:**
>There are two states of routing table entries:
>- If there is no IP address range conflict, the state is **valid** by default.
>- If there is a conflict with other existing routes, the state is **invalid**. For conflict rules and restrictions, see [Usage Restrictions - Route Restrictions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30052#routing-restrictions).

>If you need to use an invalid route, see [Disabling a Route](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30068) and [Enabling an Invalid Route](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30069).
