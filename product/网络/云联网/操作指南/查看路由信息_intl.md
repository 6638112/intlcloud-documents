>**Note:**
>There are two states of routing table entries:
>- If there is no IP address range conflict, the state is **valid** by default.
>- If there is a conflict with other existing routes, the state is **invalid**. For conflict rules and restrictions, see [Usage Restrictions - Route Restrictions](/document/product/877/18679#.E8.B7.AF.E7.94.B1.E9.99.90.E5.88.B6).
