The Tencent Cloud NAT gateway features Source Network Address Translation (SNAT), Destination Network Address Translation (DNAT), gateway traffic control, traffic alarm, shared bandwidth package, secure high defense, automatic disaster recovery, and more.
## SNAT
SNAT allows multiple VPC CVMs to actively access the Internet through the same public IP. The NAT gateway supports forwarding up to 5 Gbps of data to a single instance.
## DNAT
DNAT is used to map private IPs, protocols, and ports of the CVM in the VPC to public IPs, protocols, and ports, so that services on the CVM can be accessed from the public network.
## Gateway Traffic Control
You can enable gateway traffic control for the NAT gateway. The gateway traffic control can limit the bandwidth between a private IP and a NAT gateway, and provide "monitoring" and "controlling" capabilities at IP-gateway granularity. The refined gateway traffic visualization enables network OPS personnel to get a clear picture of the traffic in the gateway. In addition, the speed restricting capability at IP-gateway granularity helps implement rapid troubleshooting, block exceptional traffic, and guarantee key businesses.
## Traffic Alarm
Custom traffic alarms can be set, which will be triggered when any metric exceeds the threshold. Alarm messages are sent via email and SMS to inform you of any risks in advance. Monitor and alarm services are provided free of charge, with an aim to assist you to identify problems quickly.
## Shared Bandwidth Package
The NAT gateway can be used with shared bandwidth packages to allow public network bandwidth to be shared by multiple IPs, which can be used for staggering the traffic among different applications, effectively reducing bandwidth costs.
## Secure High Defense
Dayu Anti-DDoS can provide ultra-large bandwidth DDoS and CC defense for Tencent Cloud users, with a capacity of up to 310 Gbps. You can bind the protection pack to the NAT gateway that requires defense for security protection.
## Automatic Disaster Recovery
The NAT gateway provides master/slave hot backup and automatic disaster recovery, allowing automatic switching when a single server suffers a failure without affecting your use of the services. Service availability of up to 99.99% keeps your business running smoothly.
