If "Gateway Traffic Control Details" is enabled, you can view the metrics of IP traffic flowing through an NAT gateway over the last 7 days, and set the outbound bandwidth for the traffic flowing from an IP to the specified NAT gateway.
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), select **Products** -> **Virtual Private Cloud** to go to the VPC console, and then click **NAT Gateway** on the left pane.
2. In the list page, select the NAT gateway for which you want to enable gateway traffic control to go to its details page.
3. Click **Monitor** in the tab, and then enable **Gateway Traffic Control** at the upper right corner.
It takes 5 to 6 minutes to collect and publish data. And then you can view the monitoring details and graphs.
