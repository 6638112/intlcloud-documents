### How am I charged for peering connection?
- Intra-region peering connection is available for free.
- Cross-region peering connection is paid by the connection initiator. It supports billing by daily peak bandwidth and by monthly 95th percentile bandwidth. For more information, see [Billing Overview](/document/product/553/18833).

For the billing of VPC, see [Pricing List](/doc/product/215/3079).

### Will I receive a reminder when my cross-region peer connection expires?
- When you have insufficient balance in your account: Starting from the moment your account balance becomes 0, you can use the cross-region peering connection for a further period of 7 days with the usage being further billed.
- If your account balance fails to be topped up to an amount greater than 0 within the 7-day period, your bandwidth cap for the cross-region peering connection will become 0 (the connection becomes unavailable) and the billing will be stopped. When the account balance has been topped up to an amount greater than 0, the cross-region peering connection will resume its availability with the bandwidth cap returning to the value you set.
