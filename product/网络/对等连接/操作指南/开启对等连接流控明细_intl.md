If "Gateway Bandwidth Details" is enabled, you can check IPs going through a peering connection over the last 7 days, and set the max outbound bandwidth for the traffic from an IP to a specific peering connection.
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), and select **Products** -> **Cloud Compute & Network** -> **Virtual Private Cloud** to go to the VPC console.
2. In the left pane, click **Peering Connections** to go to the management page.
3. Click the ID of the peering connection you want to configure to go to its details page.
4. Click the **Monitor** tab, and enable the switch of **Gateway Bandwidth Details** on the upper right corner.
After the switch is enabled, it takes 5 to 6 minutes to collect and publish data. You can then view the monitoring details table below the monitoring chart.
