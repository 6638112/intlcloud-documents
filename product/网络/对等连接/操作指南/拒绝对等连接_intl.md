You can reject a "To be Accepted" peering connection request. When you receive a connection request from an untrusted account, you can choose to reject it.
1. Log in to [Tencent Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/), and select **Products** -> **Cloud Compute & Network** -> **Virtual Private Cloud** to go to the VPC console.
2. In the left pane, click **Peering Connections** to go to the management page.
3. Check the requests in "To be Accepted" status in the list, click **Reject** in the Operation column and confirm.
