## VPN Gateway Traffic Control
- VPN gateway traffic control provides the "monitoring" and "controlling" capabilities at the granularity of **IP-gateway**. Its refined visualization of gateway traffic enables network OPS personnel to get a clear picture of the traffic through the gateway. Its speed limiting at the granularity of IP-gateway helps block exceptional traffic.
The advantages of gateway traffic control are as follows:
 - Featured with the capability for accurate gateway troubleshooting, it can minimize the network failure time. It can also analyze the source IP and its key metrics by using the real-time traffic query and the TOP N ranking feature, to rapidly locate the exceptional traffic.
 - With "monitoring" and "controlling" capabilities at IP-gateway granularity and by using minute-level network traffic query, it can identify exceptional traffic that maliciously occupies the bandwidth in real time, and set bandwidth limits at IP-gateway granularity to guarantee the stable operation of core businesses.
 - It has full-time and full-traffic gateway traffic analysis capability, to help reduce cloud networking costs. By means of QoS, it can restrict the bandwidth of non-key businesses to minimize cost with limited network budget.
- For example, in the wee hours one morning, the gateway traffic of a company surges. With intelligent gateway traffic control, the OPS personnel can trace data to determine which IPs caused this traffic surge based on the time when the traffic surge occurred, so as to rapidly locate its source. In addition, the gateway traffic control provides bandwidth control at IP-gateway granularity, which can restrict the bandwidth from an IP to the gateway and block exceptional traffic to guarantee key businesses.

## Traffic Alarm
Custom traffic alarms can be set for the VPN Connection, which will be triggered when any metric exceeds the threshold. Alarm messages are sent via email and SMS to inform you of any risks in advance. Monitor and alarm services are provided free of charge, with an aim to assist you to identify problems quickly.
