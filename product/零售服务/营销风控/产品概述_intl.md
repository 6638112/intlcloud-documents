## Overview

Malicious bargain hunters are known to use a large number of alternate accounts, zombie accounts and even automatic batch tools to participate in QR code-based marketing campaigns for consumer goods such as foods, beverages, alcohols and daily necessities, incurring losses to campaign owners. Taking advantage of Tencent's proprietary security risk management models and AI correlation algorithms, Tencent Cloud Marketing Risk Management (MRM) helps you quickly identify malicious requests, accurately prevent "market speculators," improve efficiency of marketing fund use and gain insights from authentic data.

## Benefits

Nowadays, more and more vendors are becoming aware of the data distortion and economic loss caused by market speculators, so they hope to rely on Tencent's technical capabilities and user profiles to improve their data authenticity and marketing fund utilization. MRM takes advantage of Tencent's massive amounts of resources and exclusive services and utilizes Tencent's security risk management models and AI correlation algorithms to improve data accuracy.

### Request Identification

- Utilizing Tencent's security risk management models and AI correlation algorithms, MRM keeps data up-to-date in real time to ensure accurate and reliable services.
- It helps you accurately target and block market speculators while avoiding the high false positive rate of traditional blacklist mechanisms, resulting in savings of roughly 10% of marketing funds.
- It avoids malicious data interference and ensures data authenticity.

### Risk Setting

Relying on the risk management system built for Tencent's various business lines, MRM assesses the risk value of each request and provides exception flags (risktype) to help perform auxiliary analysis on risks with accounts, behaviors and environments. Custom processing measures can be defined based on risk assessment results, such as requiring additional verification, setting red packet amount limit and limiting the number of participations, to help control the risks and rewards in your campaigns.

### Convenience and Efficiency

- Relying on the advanced architecture of Tencent Cloud, MRM enables millisecond-level responses and supports dynamic scaling.
- It provides APIs for fast access in just three simple steps, making it easy to use by non-Tencent Cloud customers.
- Its 24/7 underground economy intelligence collection radar helps keep you informed of malicious behaviors as soon as they occur, so you can update your security policies in the timeliest manner.
