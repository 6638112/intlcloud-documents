## Overview
YouMall is a smart store product based on machine vision and big data analytics and dedicated to digital transformation of brick-and-mortar stores. Through the collection and analysis of information such as customer flow, shopping time, store and zone-specific customer group profiles, conversion, regional heat, traffic flows and sales associate management, YouMall presents store operations and management personnel with information that could not be previously obtained through business logic, helping optimize product category adjustment, visual merchandising and inventory management.
## Features
YouMall has the following core features:
### Customer Traffic Statistics
Leveraging LBS big data capabilities and through the installation of cameras at store entrances and insides, YouMall collects statistics on commercial district customer traffic, passersby, store visitors and sales volume to perform conversion funnel analysis across the complete offline sales chain, providing data support for every link in the store optimization and conversion process.
### Customer Group Profiling
YouMall utilizes facial recognition technology to identify visitors' basic information such as gender and age and profile visitors and buyers, making brick-and-mortar stores' inability to differentiate stores visitors and buyers a thing of the past.
### Store Heat Map
Utilizing the cameras in each store zone, YouMall realizes the analysis of zone-specific customer traffic and creates profiles of customers lingering the longest in each zone, helping you understand the preferences of different customer groups for each zone and the items sold there. Combined with zone-specific sales data, this allows for adjustment of shelf layout and visual merchandising for higher conversion rates.
### Traffic Flow Analysis
Based on in-store image information collection and big data processing, YouMall analyzes the statistics of in-store traffic flow to reveal the most popular shopping routes and provides dynamic visualization pages for shopping malls and stores, thereby helping optimize retail formats, product displays and shelf layouts.
### Sales Associate Management
Through facial recognition technology and companion algorithms, YouMall can identify the working hours of individual sales associates, number of customers guided by them and corresponding duration of service, enabling store managers to analyze the issues with sales associates' professionalism and work attitude in a more diversified way.
