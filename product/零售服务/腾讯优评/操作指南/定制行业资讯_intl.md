## Enter the industry name and keywords

- **Field description**
Industry name: This indicates the subject matter of the news you are interested in, such as "fresh products", "cloud computing" and "blockchain".
Keyword: This indicates the core words that make up the industry news. For example, "fresh" and "foods" can be used to obtain most of news information about "fresh products".
- **Keyword rule**
**"&"** and **"|"** can be used in the customization. "&" means "and", while "|" means "or".
- **Tips for keyword customization:**
When customizing keywords, try to choose the most relevant and representative words.
If the words are too precise, the data results will be reduced. For example, "fresh foods" will return less data results than "fresh & foods".
If the words are too general, the data relevance will be reduced. For example, "fresh" may mistakenly return articles that contain "...fresh air...".
- **Keyword modification:**
In order to ensure the continuity of the industry news data, each task can be modified every 30 days; therefore, please enter the keywords cautiously.
