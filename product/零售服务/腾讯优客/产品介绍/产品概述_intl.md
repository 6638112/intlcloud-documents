### Customer Traffic Heat
TLI clearly displays the distribution of visitors, members and potential customers in the commercial district utilizing heat maps. Current customer traffic concentration and ranking lists can be viewed for any specific time, helping you quickly identify the real "center" of the commercial district and providing data support for offline marketing and outdoor advertising.
### Customer Traffic Frequency
Taking advantage of precise definitions of different retail formats, TLI helps you analyze the number and frequency of visits by customers.
