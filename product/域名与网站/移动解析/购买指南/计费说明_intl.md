The HttpDNS service is postpaid based on the number of resolutions on a daily basis. The resolutions generated between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 on one day will be calculated and charged at 8:00:00 on the next day.

### Free Quota for the Enterprise Edition
For users who have activated the HttpDNS service, as long as the service is in normal state, the system will offer a traffic pack with a certain free quota every month (calculated by 30 days), and the quota provided varies for different user types:

| User type | Free resolutions |
|---------|---------|
| Tencent Cloud DNS user | 6 million/month |
| Non-Tencent Cloud DNS user | 3 million/month |

Tencent Cloud DNS user refers to those who use Tencent Cloud DNS or DNSPod.

### Traffic Pack
You can purchase traffic packs for deduction. The system will deduct the available resolutions from the traffic packs first when billing, and the excessive part will be billed at the unit price of **USD0.0059/10,000 resolutions**.

The pricing of traffic packs is as follows:

| Traffic pack size | Unit price (in USD) | Validity period |
|--------|--------| --------|
| 10 million resolutions | 4.71 | 3 months |
| 30 million resolutions | 12.35 | 3 months	|
| 300 million resolutions | 114.7 | 3 months |
| 1.5 billion resolutions | 529.4 | 3 months |
Note: A traffic pack becomes effective on the day of purchase for a validity period of 3 months from the date of purchase, and the remaining available resolutions will become invalid once the pack expires.
