### Arrears and Service Suspension
As soon as your Tencent Cloud account becomes in arrears, we will remind you of the arrears status via email or SMS. Due to various factors such as weekends and holidays, a 7-day grace period is allowed and your HttpDNS service will be suspended on the 8th day.

### Service Resuming
After your HttpDNS service is suspended, your account ID and related configuration information will be retained for six months during which you can resume the service at any time.
