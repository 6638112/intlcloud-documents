>**Notes:**
>.com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网 domain names must be verified after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used.

## Step 1: Batch Query of Domain Names
Before registering a domain name, you need to query whether the domain name or the suffix you want to register already exists. If so, you need to choose another unregistered domain name or suffix before proceeding to the next step.
Tencent Cloud supports batch query of domain names, allowing you to query multiple domain names with just one click.
### 1. Open domain name registration page
Log in to the [Tencent Cloud official website](https://cloud.tencent.com/), and enter the domain name registration page by the following ways:
 - Method 1: On the top navigation bar, open **Products** -> **Domain Name and Website** -> **Domain Service** to go to the domain name registration page.
