If your domain name has expired for more than 30 days but not more than 60 days, your domain name will be in the "domain name redemption period". During this period, you can redeem the domain name by paying a price higher than the normal renewal cost to keep using it. Make sure to renew your domain name in advance to keep it functional and avoid unnecessary loss.
>**Notes:**
1. To redeem a domain name, you need to make a payment which is higher than the normal renewal price (price for redemption is determined by the registry, and Tencent Cloud only collects the fee for the registry).
2. Domain name resolution is suspended during the redemption period. When a domain name is successfully redeemed, the DNS will be resumed within 72 hours.But you need to reset the resolution record of the domain, which will take effect within 24-72 hours.

Detailed steps for domain name redemption are as follows:
Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console. On the **Products in Use** page, click **Domain Service** to view the list of information of all domain names you have purchased.
