## What is domain name information template?

Domain name information template is a pre-formatted file that contains the domain name registrant's basic information to get you started with registering domain name, changing domain name owner, applying for identity verification and performing other steps quickly by just entering the required information in the template. If the template has gone through the identity verification, you can directly select the template with a status of "Identity Verified" when registering a domain name for which identity verification is required. The system will upload the data required for the identity verification automatically after the domain name is registered successfully.

> **Note:**
> The domain names with a suffix such as .club, .xyz, .info, .wang, and .mobi cannot be associated with the template status "Identity Verified". For such domain names, you need to apply for identity verification within 5 working days after the domain name is registered.
