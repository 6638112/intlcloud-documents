If the domain name information (such as email address or mobile number) you entered during registration is changed, you need to modify the information to protect your domain name.

>**Notes:**
>1. Identity verification is not required by the registry for domain names registered before July 18th, 2016. Thus, the domain name owner can be modified if the domain name is not verified or not being verified.
>2. The domain name owner owns the domain name. If you lost your account and need to get back your domain name, you can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for technical assistance. You also need to provide the following certificates:
 * Individual: the personal ID number and a scanned copy of frontal personal ID card;
 * Enterprise: a scanned copy of the business license or organization code certificate.

>3. For more information on domain name verification, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/8580).
