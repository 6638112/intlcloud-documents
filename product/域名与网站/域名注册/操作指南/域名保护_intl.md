Enabling domain name privacy protection can protect your domain name registration information from being exposed and your domain name from being flooded by spam messages.
>**Notes:**
>Information such as the mobile number and email address of the domain name contact is protected for domain names that have been verified (identity verification is required for .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网 domain names), while the information of the domain name owner is not protected.
>When the domain name protection is enabled (the button is displayed in blue), the domain name owner and other information cannot be modified unless you disable the feature first.
