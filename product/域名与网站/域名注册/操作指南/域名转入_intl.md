## Conditions for Domain Name Transfer
Domain name transfer is conducted between registrars. Now Tencent Cloud cooperates with Xinnet in domain name registration, so domain names registered at Xinnet cannot be transferred to Tencent Cloud. The following conditions must be met to transfer domain names to Tencent Cloud:
- You are the owner of the domain name, or you are authorized by the owner to manage the domain name.
- The domain name is in a normal status (Active or OK). The domain name is not locked or under transfer protection.
- The domain name has been registered or renewed for over 60 days, and will not expire until at least 15 days later.
- The last successful transfer of the domain name was conducted at least 60 days ago.
- Domain Name Transfer supports 16 domain suffixes, including .club, .com, .net, .xyz, .org, .info, .cn, .com.cn, .net.cn, .name, .mobi, .wang, .ac.cn, .在线, .中国 and .中文网.

## Charges for Domain Name Transfer
Domain name transfer is conducted for free. However, according to regulations of the registry, you must renew your domain name for another year upon transferring it to Tencent Cloud.
> **Note:**
> If your domain name has already reached the limit for renewal (10 years), the usage period of the domain name cannot be added on an annual basis when you have paid for the transfer order.

## Guidance for Domain Name Transfer

### Get the EPP code
Submit a domain name transfer application to the original registrar to obtain the EPP code.
An EPP code (auth code) must be obtained from the original registrar when you transfer a domain name. For registrars outside Mainland China (such as Godaddy), the EPP code can be sent to the email of the domain name owner with a click on a button on the control panel. While there is usually no such feature for domestic registrars, you need to contact the registrar or the registration agency where you registered your domain name and ask for the EPP code manually, or request for domain name transfer. In this case, they can provide you with the transfer process.
If you purchase your domain name from an agency of a registrar (www.net.cn or www.west.cn), when the agency refuses to provide the EPP code, you can send a complaint to its registrar. If the registrar does not cooperate, send your complaint to ICANN, CNNIC or other registries.
According to the regulations of domain name administration authorities (ICANN Domain Name Transfer Policy), the original registrar is not allowed to refuse or restrict the request for transferring domain names, nor ask for any extra fee for any reason. If the original registrar does not follow the rules, the domain name owner can submit a complaint via the [international domain name transfer complaint page](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form).

## Reasons for domain name transfer failure
If you fail to transfer an international domain name to Tencent Cloud, some reasons are as follows:
- The domain name status is not "ACTIVE" or "OK". If domain name's "STATUS" is not "ACTIVE" or "OK" when queried via the whois system, the domain name will not be successfully transferred. Contact the original domain name registrar to restore domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).
- The original registrar refuses the request for transfer. Contact the original registrar to complete the procedure for domain name transfer, and then submit a request for transferring the domain name at Tencent Cloud.
- The domain name has already expired. Contact the original registrar to renew your domain name, and then submit a request for transferring the domain name at Tencent Cloud.
- The email address for the domain name service is invalid. Contact the original registrar to change the contact email for the domain name service to a valid one which can be used to reply to confirmation emails in time.
- The transfer confirmation email is not replied in time. After you submit an international domain name transfer application to Tencent Cloud and confirm the transfer, the original registrar will send you a confirmation email for domain name transfer with a time limit. Domain name transfer will not succeed if you don't reply to this email in time.
- The original domain name admin email is changed after the transfer application is submitted. The new email does not receive the confirmation email for transfer, as the email has been sent to the original admin contact email.
- The transfer fails immediately if you entered an incorrect EPP code.
- Contact your original domain name registrar to obtain the EPP code, as Tencent Cloud is not able to obtain it for you.
