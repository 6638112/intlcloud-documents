Tencent Cloud provides an auto renewal feature to free you from renewing domain names manually. When this feature is enabled, the system will automatically renew your domain name upon expiration. Make sure your account balance is sufficient to avoid renewal failure. The steps to configure the feature are as follows:
**Step 1: Log in to the Console**
Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console, where you can view the list of information on all domain names you have purchased.
