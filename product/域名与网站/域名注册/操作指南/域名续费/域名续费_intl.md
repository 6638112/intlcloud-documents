Domain name renewal is used to prolong the validity of your registered domain name. Tencent Cloud will send you an email or SMS notification before the domain name expires. Renew in time to ensure that your domain name stays functional. The steps for renewal are as follows:

## Step 1: Log in to the Console
Log in to the Tencent Cloud console, select **Products** -> **Domain Name and Website** -> **Domain Service** to go to the domain name service page, where you can view the list of information on all domain names you have purchased.
