>**Notes:**
>According to the regulations of the registry, the valid period of a domain name cannot exceed 10 years (5 years for ".co" domain names).
>You can only renew a domain name for 1 year during redemption. If you need to renew a domain name for longer, perform renewal operation after it is redeemed.

## Step 4: Confirm Information
Confirm your domain name renewal information and the amount to be paid, and then click **Confirm Purchase**.

Renewal is completed once payment is successfully made. You can check the new validity of your domain names from the **Console**. Go to **Console** -> **Invoice Management** to apply for an invoice if you need one.
