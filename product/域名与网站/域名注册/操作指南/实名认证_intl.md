According to the identity verification requirements announced by MIIT in 2017, all existing and newly registered domain names are required to be verified. For now, involved domain names include: .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网. If identity verification is not completed within a specified period of time, the registry will suspend the resolution for your domain name (Serverhold) which means the domain name will not be accessed. It will be resumed once identity verification is completed. Thus, make sure to complete the verification when you register a new domain name.

>**Notes:**
>1. Starting from July 18th, 2016, .com/.net domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days;
>2. Starting from January 6th, 2017, .xyz/.club/.wang/.info/.mobi domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used;
>3. All .com/.net domain names that were registered before July 18th, 2016 must complete identity verification;
>4. All .cn/.com.cn/.net.cn/.ac.cn/.中国 domestic domain names must complete identity verification within 5 days after registration, or they will be locked and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed in 1-2 work days.

## Steps for Identity Verification
Once a domain name is registered, "Pending verification" will appear in the console which means verification is required for the domain name. There are two types of identity verification: individual verification and enterprise verification. The two approaches require different information.
### Individual verification
If you entered "individual" as user information upon registering your domain name, you need to enter individual information to complete individual identity verification. The steps are as follows:
**Step 1: Go to the domain service page**
Log in to the Tencent Cloud console. On the **Products in Use** tab, click **Domain Service** to view the list of information of all domain names you have purchased.

**Step 2: Submit materials for verification**
Choose the domain name for which identity verification is to be completed and click **Pending verification** under the corresponding **Status** bar to go to the identity verification page.

In the identity verification page, confirm the domain name information first. If the information was entered during registration and you want to modify the information, click **Edit**. Next, submit the materials for domain name verification, upload the scanned copy of your frontal ID card and business license. Confirm if the ID number automatically filled by the system is correct, and then click **Submit**.
You can also select a domain name information template and click **Create Template** in the information template page, as shown below:

Then click **Submit**.
>**Notes:**
>To improve accuracy and speed of the verification process, it is recommended to submit scanned copy of your ID card instead of unclear pictures taken by a camera;
>For identity verification for .com, .net, .cn, .xyz, .club, .wang, .中国 domain names, the submitted ID card must match with the identity of the domain name owner.
