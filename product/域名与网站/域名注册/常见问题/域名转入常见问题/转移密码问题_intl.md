### What is EPP code?
An EPP code is an authorization code for domain name transfer. To acquire it, contact the original domain name registrar, who will send you this code via email after verifying the domain name. After acquiring the code, provide it to the new registrar, and the transfer will be completed within 5-7 days.  

Contact your original domain name registrar to acquire the EPP code, as Tencent Cloud is unable to acquire it for you.

### How do I obtain the EPP code?  
Submit a domain name transfer application to the original registrar to obtain the EPP code.
An EPP code (auth code) must be obtained from the original registrar when you transfer a domain name.
- For registrars outside Mainland China (such as Godaddy), the transfer code can be sent to the email of the domain name owner with a click on a button on the control panel.
- While there is usually no such feature for registrars in Mainland China, you need to contact the registrar or the registration agency where you registered your domain name and ask for the EPP code manually, or request for domain name transfer. In this case, they can provide you with the transfer process.

### What if the registrar refuses to provide the EPP code?
If you purchased your domain name from an agency of a registrar (www.net.cn or www.west.cn), when the agency refuses to provide the EPP code:  
1. you can send a complaint to its registrar.  
2. you can send your complaint to ICANN, CNNIC or other registries if the registrar does not cooperate.

According to the regulations of domain name administration authorities (ICANN Domain Name Transfer Policy), the original registrar is not allowed to refuse or restrict the request for transferring domain names, nor ask for any extra fee for any reason. If the original registrar does not follow the rules, the domain name owner can submit a complaint via the [international domain name transfer complaint page](http://www.icann.org/en/resources/compliance/complaints/transfer/form).
