### What are the precautions for domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud?
- Since Tencent Cloud now cooperates with Xinnet, your domain name will be transferred to Xinnet, but Tencent Cloud will provide subsequent domain name services for you.
- Domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud is free of charge, but according to the regulations of the registry, you need to renew your domain name for another year upon transfer-in (transferred to Xinnet), which means you need to make a payment for renewing the domain name for one more year.
- If the domain name's usage period has already reached the limit (10 years), you need to pay a price for 1-year renewal upon transfer, but the usage period will not increase.   

### What are the requirements for domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud?
The following six conditions must be met before a domain name is transferred to Tencent Cloud. If any condition is not met, you need to make adjustments to meet the condition first:  
1. The service provider of the domain name must be Tencent Cloud.  
2. You are the owner of the domain name, or are authorized by the owner to manage the domain name.  
3. The domain name must have been registered at least 60 days ago, and will not expire until 60 days (15 days for ".cn" domain names) later.  
4. If you have renewed your domain name at the original registrar after expiration, it is suggested that you transfer the domain name to Tencent Cloud after 60 days upon the renewal. Otherwise, you will not be able to renew the domain name for another year upon transfer according to the regulations of the registry.  
5. The domain name is under normal status and is not involved in any dispute or arrears.  
6. The domain name is not being processed by judiciaries, arbitration institutions or domain name dispute resolution agencies.

### How long will it take to transfer a domain name to Tencent Cloud successfully?
It depends on how fast the domain name is transferred from the original registrar. If the original registrar confirms the transfer quickly, the domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud will be fast. The transfer process is usually completed in 5-7 days. If the process fails, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=16&level2_id=17&level1_name=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1&level2_name=%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D) to contact the technical customer service.

### What are the reasons for failed domain name transfer to Tencent Cloud?  
1. The domain name is not in the status of "ACTIVE" or "OK". If the domain name's "STATUS" is not "ACTIVE" or "OK" when queried via Whois, the domain name will not be successfully transferred. Contact the domain name registrar to restore domain name status to "ACTIVE" or "OK" (or unlock the domain name).  
2. The original registrar refuses the request for transfer. Contact the original registrar to complete the procedure for domain name transfer, and then submit a request for transferring the domain name at Tencent Cloud.    
3. An incorrect EPP code is entered. The transfer fails immediately if you enter an incorrect EPP code.  
4. The transfer confirmation email is not replied in time. After you submit an international domain name transfer application to Tencent Cloud and confirm the transfer, the original registrar will send you a confirmation email for domain name transfer with a time limit. Domain name transfer will not succeed if you don't reply to this email in time.
