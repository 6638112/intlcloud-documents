### How do I change the domain name owner?
Under the same account, if you want to change the owner of your domain name to someone else, you need to modify the owner in the domain name information and save the change. For more information, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/3648).

### Can I change domain name information after identity verification is completed?
You can still change domain name information after the identity verification is completed. Log in to the Tencent Cloud Domain Service Console, and click **Manage** behind the domain name to be modified. On the displayed page, go to **Domain Info** -> **Domain Profile**, click **Edit** to finish the identity verification by entering the new information or selecting an existing template, and save the change.

### Can I apply for identity verification for domain names in "Transferring" status?
If your domain name is in "Transferring" status, you cannot apply for identity verification for this domain name on the domain name management page until the transfer is completed. The transfer process takes about 5 work days, and cannot be expedited because it involves review of the registry. Please wait patiently.

### What should I do when prompted "This domain name has been used by another user. Contact us to reclaim it."?
If such a prompt appears, click **Reclaim**. For more information, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/302/3467).      

### How do I modify the information of a domain name or transfer a domain name when the Tencent Cloud account used to purchase the domain name is frozen and cannot be logged in to or recovered?
* The domain name information is complete, that is, domain name privacy protection is disabled  
You need to provide the certificate of the domain name owner, the original and the new account, and the domain name to be transferred, and then [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for the help from OPS personnel.
* The domain name information is incomplete, that is, domain name privacy protection is enabled  
We cannot transfer the domain name for you, because we cannot find any information about your domain name and cannot confirm your information when domain name privacy protection is enabled for your domain name.  

### What if the correspondence address in the domain name profile is inconsistent with that in the domain name certificate?
The inconsistency is caused by the enabling of domain name privacy protection. If this option is enabled, the correspondence address of the registrar is displayed by default. You can disable this option, and the correspondence address in the domain name certificate will be updated in real time.

### Can a domain name owner cancel modifications to a domain name?
Canceling modifications that have been made is not supported.

### What should I do if I failed to modify the domain name information?
The domain name information cannot be modified when domain name privacy protection is enabled. Please disable this option before modifying the information.    
If you still failed to modify the domain name information with this option disabled, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### How do I modify the user type?
The user type can be modified directly on the console, as shown below.
