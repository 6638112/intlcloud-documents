For one primary domain name, you can apply for up to 20 TrustAsia DV SSL certificates for free. The first-level domain name and its sub-domain names, such as domain.com, ssl.domain.com and ssl.ssl.domain.com, belong to the same primary domain.  

### How do I download a domain name certificate?
+ For a domain name registered at Tencent Cloud  
Log in to the Tencent Cloud Console and select **Products** -> **Domain Name and Website** -> **Domain Service** to go to the Domain Service Console. Select the domain name, click **More** -> **Download domain certificate** in the **Operation** column to enter the domain name service page, and you can see the domain name certificate. You can download the certificate locally by clicking **Download certificate** and print it by clicking **Print certificate**.  
+ For a domain name not registered at Tencent Cloud   
You can't download the certificate of a domain name not registered at Tencent Cloud from Tencent. Please contact your domain name registrar.

Note: If you find your domain name's certification authority is "Beijing Xinnet Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd.", don't worry. Because we have a strategic cooperation relationship with Xinnet for now, and we use domain names from Xinnet.

### What should I do if the message "You have not registered as a Tencent Cloud DNS user yet" appears when I add a domain name?
Log in to the [Tencent Cloud official website](https://cloud.tencent.com/). Click **Account Information** -> **Verification** and finish the verification.
### Is there a limit on the purchase period for a domain name?
According to ICANN, a user is only allowed to own a domain name for 10 years at most. That is to say, you can purchase a domain name for 10 years at most. And the maximum renewal period for a domain name = 10 years - the purchased usage year. For example, if you have purchased a domain name for 3 years, you can renew it for another 7 years at most. 

Note: Certain domain names with special suffixes (such as .tm) can only be purchased by making one-off payment for 10 years, thus you do not need to renew them.

### How do I get back my domain name if I lost my account?
The domain name owner owns the domain name. If you lost your account and need to get back your domain name, [__submit a ticket__](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for technical assistance. You also need to provide the following certificates:


- Individual user: ID card number and a scanned copy of the front of your ID card.
- Enterprise user: a scanned copy of your business license or organization code certificate.
