### Who is Tencent Cloud's domain name registrar?
Tencent Cloud's domain name registrar is Beijing Xinnet Digital Information Technology Co., Ltd. (Xinnet Digital).

### What should be taken into consideration after a domain name is registered successfully?
1. Identity verification  
Identity verification must be completed within 5 working days after the domain name registration. Otherwise, the domain name will remain in the "serverhold" status and cannot be used. For more information, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/6707).
2. On-time renewal  
A domain name is only valid for a period of time. Be sure to renew it before its expiration to avoid service unavailability. Renewal is allowed in both Renewal Period and Redemption Period, but domain name resolution will be affected during these periods. For more information, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/3705).
3. Information change  
In case of any changes of your registration information, be sure to [modify domain name registration information](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/3648) in a timely manner.  

Note: For some domain names with a special suffix (such as .tm), a one-off payment is made for 10 years of usage and renewal is not required.  

### Is a domain name refundable once being registered successfully?
A domain name is unmodifiable and nonrefundable once being registered successfully. For example, if the domain name "xiaochengxu" is accidentally registered as "xiaochenxu", you have no choice but to re-register the correct domain name.

### Is a domain name deletable once being registered successfully?
No. If you don't need the domain name any longer, do not renew it upon its expiration. If you don't want to access your website using this domain name, you can suspend or delete the resolution record in the domain name console.

### What should I do if the domain name registration fails?
If the domain name status is "Registration Failed", you can register the domain name again; Possible reasons for registration failure are as follows:

  __The order is not paid successfully__ 


1. The domain name is already registered by another user. All domain names are unique, so you need to register a different domain name.
2. The domain name registration failed to pass the verification of the domain name authority due to incorrect registration information. Correct the information and register the domain name again.


  __The order has been paid__ 

 If your payment has been debited from your account, you can [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) to contact the customer service.  

### How do I query the domain name information?
You can query the information such as domain name owner, expiration date and registrar through WHOIS.

### Why does not my domain name exist in the registrar's verification library?

 1. __The domain name failed to pass the identity verification.__ Any domain name that has not completed identity verification cannot be put to the verification library even if the registrar is in China.
 2. __It will take 3 work days to acquire the ICP license for the domain name after it passes the identity verification.__ In such case, the domain name still cannot be put in the verification library.

In both cases, you will get the message __The domain name does not exist in the registrar's verification library__, and the domain name cannot be submitted to the domain name authority. Only when the domain name is put in the registrar's verification library can the ICP license be issued for it.

To check whether your domain name exists in the registrar's verification library, contact your domain name registrar.
For any domain name registered with Tencent Cloud, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
