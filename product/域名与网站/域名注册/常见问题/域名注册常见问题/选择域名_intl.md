### How do I select a suitable domain name?
1. It is recommended to use a personalized domain name which is simple to memorize and preferably related to your company name, brand or product. You can also select a domain name based on the nature or functionality of your website or your customer base.
2. You can register multiple suffixes for the same domain name to protect your brand and make it easier for users to find your website.
3. It is suggested that you select a usage period of more than 2 years when purchasing a domain name. Domain names are rented on a yearly basis. Registering a domain name for multiple years can help you reduce the risk of losing it when domain name prices rise or when you forget to renew your domain name in time.

### What if a domain name is already registered?
Each domain name is unique. Once a domain name is registered by someone, it cannot be registered again by others. You can search for domain names with different suffixes. For example, if you want to register `abc.com` which is already taken, you can try going for `abc.net` or `abc.cn`. They have no differences when being used.
If you want to acquire a domain name that has already been registered by someone else, you can query its owner by entering the domain name in the Whois and contact the owner to see whether he/she is willing to transfer it to you. You can also ask a domain name intermediary or a similar agency to purchase this domain name.  

### What should I do if I have a domain name dispute?
Any organization or individual can file a complaint to a dispute resolution body if they believe that a domain name registered by someone else violates their lawful rights and interests.
If you believe that the domain name you registered is involved in a dispute, contact a domain name dispute resolution body verified by CNNIC to settle the dispute. There are two such bodies: The Domain Name Dispute Resolution Center of China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission, and Hong Kong International Arbitration Center.
