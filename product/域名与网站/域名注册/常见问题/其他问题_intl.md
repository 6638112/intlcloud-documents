### What if the original email for the domain name service is invalid?
Contact the original registrar to change the contact email for the domain name service to a valid one which can be used to reply to confirmation emails in time.

### Are Tencent Cloud account and DNSPod account linked to each other?
Yes. You can view all domain names on the Domain Service Console.

### How do I receive invoices after registering my domain name?
After successfully registering your domain name, do the following steps if you need an invoice:
1. Log in to **Tencent Cloud Console** -> **Billing Center** -> [**Invoice Management**](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/invoice) to enter your invoice information and mailing information.
2. Click **Apply for Invoice** and choose invoice type and amount according to your needs.
3. Confirm your invoice amount and mailing information, and then click **OK**.

### What should I do if I can't use the domain name voucher?
This is because your order contains an SSL certificate order by default. Delete the default order, or the data cannot be pulled.

### Is there a special offer if I purchase a domain name for multiple years?
Tencent Cloud does not provide special offers for the purchase of a domain name for multiple years, but provide one for the purchase of a domain name in the first year.

### Which payment methods are supported for domain names?
Supported payment methods by Tencent Cloud include PayPal, credit card and bank transfer.

### What are the requirements for domain name transfer?
If you need to transfer your domain name, log in to Tencent Cloud using the account with which you registered the domain name and apply for domain name transfer on the Domain Name Service page to acquire the transfer code. Note that you can only apply for domain name transfer after the domain name is registered for 60 days.

### Why can't the explicit URL be used after a domain name is registered successfully?
Due to the abuse of explicit URL forwarding, explicit URLs can only be added free of charge for newly registered domain names one month after they are resolved on the platform. Explicit URLs can be added up to Level 3.

### Is certificate revocation supported?
Now, only offline certificate revocations are supported. Please submit a ticket to contact Tencent Cloud engineers for certificate revocation. For more information on revocation procedure of Domain Validated (DV) certificates, see [here](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/400/6550).
