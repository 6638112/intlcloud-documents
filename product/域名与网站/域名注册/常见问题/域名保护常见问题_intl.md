### What does domain name privacy protection do?
Enabling domain name privacy protection can protect your domain name registration information from being exposed and your domain name from being flooded by spam messages.  

### How do I enable domain name privacy protection?
The domain name privacy protection feature helps protect your domain name information. Log in to the Tencent Cloud Domain Service Console and select the domain name to be protected, and click **More** -> **Domain Privacy Protection** in the **Operation** column.

### What if domain name privacy protection cannot be disabled?
Domain name privacy protection cannot be disabled under the following two situations:

1. __You has not applied for identity verification for the domain name__, or __the identity verification is still under review__.
We recommend that you complete the identity verification for the domain name before disabling domain name privacy protection for it.

2. __Frequent operation__. You are not allowed to disable domain name privacy protection right after it is enabled.
We recommend that you wait for a while and then refresh the page and try again.

If your problem persists after you follow the instructions above, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category) for technical support.
