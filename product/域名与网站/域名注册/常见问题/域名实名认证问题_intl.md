## Before Verification   

### Why is identity verification required for a domain name?
According to the identity verification requirements announced by MIIT in 2017, all existing and newly registered domain names are required to be verified. For now, involved domain names include: .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网. If identity verification is not completed within a specified period of time, the registry will suspend the resolution for your domain name (Serverhold) which means the domain name cannot be accessed until identity verification is completed. Thus, make sure to complete the verification when you register a new domain name.
>**Notes:**  
- Starting from July 18, 2016, .com/.net domain names must be verified within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days.  
- Starting from January 6, 2017, .xyz/.club/.wang/.info/.mobi domain names must be verified within 5 days after registration, or they will be put into Serverhold status and cannot be used.  
- All .com/.net domain names that were registered before July 18, 2016 must be verified.  
- The Chinese domain names .cn/.com.cn/.net.cn/.ac.cn/.中国 must be verified within 5 days after registration, or they will be locked and cannot be used. Once identity verification is completed, the domain name will be resumed in 1-2 work days.  

### What materials do I need to submit for identity verification?
- If your domain name is owned by an individual, you need to provide the scanned copy of frontal personal ID card which belongs to the domain name owner (the copy must be a .jpg file no smaller than 55 KB and no larger than 1 MB).
- If the domain name is owned by an enterprise, you need to provide the scanned copy of the business license, or organization code certificate, or unified social credit code which belongs to the domain name owner (the copy must be a .jpg file no smaller than 55 KB and no larger than 1 MB).  

### Is identity verification required when I transfer a domain name from another registrar to Tencent Cloud?
When a domain name is transferred to Tencent Cloud, you need to complete identity verification at Tencent Cloud regardless of the previous verification status, so that you can manage the domain name information from Tencent Cloud conveniently.

### Is identity verification required for .xyz domain names?
Yes. Identity verification is required for the following domain names: .com/.net/.cn/.xyz/.club/.wang/.mobi/.info/.中国/.在线/.中文网.

### Do I need to wait for identity verification to complete to view the domain name certificate?
No. The domain name certificate is generated immediately when a domain name is purchased and registered.

## In Verification  
### How does an individual achieve identity verification for a domain name?
If you entered "individual" as the user when registering a domain name, you need to verify your identity by providing personal information. For more information, see [Identity Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/6707#.E4.B8.AA.E4.BA.BA.E8.AE.A4.E8.AF.81).
>**Note:**
>For identity verification for .com, .net, .cn, .xyz, .club, .wang, .中国 domain names, the submitted ID card must match with the identity of the domain name owner.  

### How does an enterprise achieve identity verification for a domain name?
If you entered "enterprise" as the user when registering a domain name, you need to enter the enterprise information for verification. For more information, see [Identity Verification](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/242/6707#.E4.BC.81.E4.B8.9A.E8.AE.A4.E8.AF.81).

>**Notes:**
>After the administration department puts "integration of three certificates" (business license, organization code certificate, and tax registration certificate) into practice, the certificates for certain enterprises are now unified social credit codes.
>- If you chose "Business License" as verification method, enter the complete and correct social credit code;
>- If you chose "Organization Code Certificate", enter the correct social credit code starting from the 9th digit to the second to last digit.  

### How long does it take to complete the identity verification?
Once verification request is submitted, it usually takes 3-5 work days to complete verification. You can check the progress from the domain name service page.

### How many statuses are there in domain name identity verification?
There are 4 statuses in identity verification: Identity Verified, Pending Verification, Verifying, and Verification Failed.
During domain name identity verification, the domain name will be put into Serverhold status, and resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days once verification is successful.  
### What should I do if the domain name with a suffix of .com/.net/.cn/.中国 is put into Serverhold status?
A .com/.net/.cn/.中国 domain name will be locked and put into Serverhold status if identity verification is not completed within 5 days after registration. Go to the Domain Service Console and request for identity verification. Once verification is passed, the domain name will be resumed to OK status in 1-2 work days.

### Can I modify information when domain name identity verification is in progress?
You cannot modify the information.


## After Verification  
### Why did I fail to submit the information used for identity verification for a domain name?  
1. Make sure the uploaded information is correct:    
  * Format: jpg   
  * Size: less than 1 MB  
2. Whether the domain name type is correct:     
  * Only ID card can be uploaded for identity verification of individual users   
  * Only business license or organization code certificate can be uploaded for identity verification of enterprise users  

When the information is correct, clear the browser cache or use another browser to try again. If the problem persists, [submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).

### What are the possible reasons for failed identity verification?
1. The submitted certificate does not match with the identity of the domain name owner. Check if the certificate information you submitted completely matches with the identity of the domain name owner. If not, correct the information and submit for verification again.
2. The submitted information is unclear, incomplete or cannot be opened. Submit the complete and clear picture of the required certificate in the correct format.
3. Verification of the submitted certificate information failed (identity certificate does not match with the result queried by public security department API).      
  * Individual: If your household registration is being migrated, or ID card has expired or is invalid, you can submit your residence certificate (with household special stamp) or a scanned copy of your household registration booklet.  
  * Enterprise: If your enterprise name on business license has changed, or certificate has expired or is invalid, you can submit your enterprise certification information (with official seal of the Administration for Industry and Commerce) or other valid certificate.
4. The submitted certificate is unqualified. For an individual domain name, you need to submit a scanned copy of ID card that matches with the identity of the domain name owner; for an enterprise domain name, submit a scanned copy of the business license or organization code certificate that matches with the identity of the domain name owner.
5. Domain name information is incomplete. Complete your domain name information and submit for identity verification again.


### Can I change domain name information if identity verification is completed?
If identity verification is completed, you can go to the domain name service page and click **Edit** to modify the owner information or select existing template information.
>**Note:**
Changing the owner of a domain name who has completed identity verification requires you to upload the certificate information of the new owner for identity verification again. This does not affect the current verification status of the domain name, which means the resolution of and the access to the domain name stay functional when you change its owner.


### What should I do if I receive "Registrant name of the identity certificate does not match with the name in the system" in my domain name verification?
This is because the name shown on the scanned certificate you submitted does not match with the name of the domain name owner. Correct the information to pass the verification. You can perform the following operation based on the domain name owner information (individual or enterprise):  
- If the domain name is owned by an individual, upload a scanned copy of the ID card of this individual.  
- If the domain name is owned by an enterprise, upload a scanned copy of the business license or organization code certificate of the enterprise.
