HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL), based on SSL for secure data transfer, is the encrypted version of HTTP. By installing an SSL certificate on your website, you can change your site from HTTP to HTTPS.

Advantages for sites applying HTTPS:

### 1. Anti-traffic hijacking
Applying HTTPS for the whole site is a solution to eradicate traffic hijacking by ISPs and man-in-the-middle attacks, which can prevent advertisements inserted in webpages, and protect user privacy.

### 2. Improving Search Rankings
HTTPS can help improve search rankings, credibility and brand image of sites.

### 3. Avoiding Phishing Sites
The green icon on HTTPS address bar helps users identify phishing sites, which protects the interests of users and businesses, and enhances users' trust in sites.
