After decompressing the downloaded www.domain.com.zip file, you get three folders that contain the certificate files of Apache, IIS, and Nginx servers.
Here are examples of certificate installation on four types of servers:

### 1. Apache 2.x certificate deployment

#### 1.1 Obtain the certificate
Obtain the certificate files 1_root_bundle.crt, 2_www.domain.com_cert.crt and the private key file 3_www.domain.com.key in the Apache folder.
The file 1_root_bundle.crt contains certificate codes "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----".
The file 2_www.domain.com_cert.crt contains certificate codes "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----".
The file 3_www.domain.com.key contains private key codes "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----".

#### 1.2 Certificate installation
Edit the file conf/httpd.conf in the Apache root directory.
Find `#LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so` and `#Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf`, and remove the symbol `#`.
Modify the file conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf in the Apache root directory as follows:
```
<VirtualHost 0.0.0.0:443>
    DocumentRoot "/var/www/html"
    ServerName www.domain.com
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /usr/local/apache/conf/2_www.domain.com_cert.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/local/apache/conf/3_www.domain.com.key
    SSLCertificateChainFile /usr/local/apache/conf/1_root_bundle.crt
</VirtualHost>
```
After the configuration is completed, restart Apache and you can access `https://www.domain.com` in a browser over a public network.

Note:

| Configuration File Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| SSLEngine on | SSL feature is enabled |
| SSLCertificateFile | Certificate file |
| SSLCertificateKeyFile | Private key file |
| SSLCertificateChainFile | Certificate chain file |

### 2. Nginx certificate deployment

#### 2.1 Obtain the certificate
Obtain the certificate file 1_www.domain.com_bundle.crt and the private key file 2_www.domain.com.key in the Nginx folder.
The file 1_www.domain.com_bundle.crt contains certificate codes "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" and "-----END CERTIFICATE-----".
The file 2_www.domain.com.key contains private key codes "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----" and "-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----".

#### 2.2 Certificate installation
Save the certificate file 1_www.domain.com_bundle.crt and the private key file 2_www.domain.com.key of the domain name www.domain.com in the same directory, such as /usr/local/nginx/conf.
Update the file conf/nginx.conf in the root directory Nginx as follows:
```
server {
        listen 443;
        server_name www.domain.com; #Enter the domain name to be bound with the certificate
        ssl on;
        ssl_certificate 1_www.domain.com_bundle.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key 2_www.domain.com.key;
        ssl_session_timeout 5m;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2; #Configure according to the protocol
        ssl_ciphers ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5:!RC4:!DHE; #Configure according to the suite
        ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
        location / {
            root   html; #Site directory
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }
```
After the configuration is completed, use `bin/nginx â€“t` to test whether the configuration is correct. If it is correct, restart nginx, and you can access with `https: // www.domain.com`.

Note:

| Configuration File Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| listen 443 | SSL certificate's access port is 443 |
| ssl on | SSL feature is enabled |
| ssl_certificate | Certificate file |
| ssl_certificate_key | Private key file |
| ssl_protocols | Protocol used |
| ssl_ciphers | Configure cipher suites by following the openssl standard |

#### 2.3 Use full site encryption, with http automatically redirected to https (optional)
For users who do not know that the site can be accessed over http, the server automatically redirects http requests to https.
If you want to configure redirection on the server side, you can add a js script in the page or write redirection in the backend programs. Also, redirection can be achieved in the web server side. Nginx supports rewrite (as long as pcre is not removed during compiling)
Add `rewrite   ^(.*) https://$host$1 permanent;` in http server
Then requests from port 80 can be redirected to https.

### 3. IIS certificate deployment

#### 3.1 Obtain the certificate

Obtain the SSL certificate file www.domain.com.pfx in the IIS folder.

#### 3.2 Certificate installation
1. Open the IIS service manager, click the computer name, and double-click 'Server Certificate'
![3.2.1](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/6d7b25b42c493bfd9d9d871b00c67398/image.png)

2. After the server certificate is opened, click **Import** on the right
![3.2.2](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/9fbedac0a2c160c72f0ef95bfaca9e18/image.png)

3. Select the certificate file. If a private key password is set when you apply for the certificate, you need to enter the password, otherwise you should enter the content of the password file keystorePass.txt in the folder, and then click **OK**. See [Instructions on Private Key Password](https://cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/400/4461)
![3.2.3](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/77fdc7cd57281b03d41a19c81af1158d/image.png)

4. Click the site name, and click **Bind** on the right
![3.2.4](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/6c7eee199d1da5d141942af170022a09/image.png)

5. On the Site Binding page, click **Add**
![3.2.5](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/58e4ee6bb90307fbe1a238ebf818ff9b/image.png)

6. Add contents for site binding: select https as the type, enter 443 as the port, select the corresponding SSL certificate, and click **OK**
![3.2.6](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/813256e938d26fb71d3223cf1eb6082b/image.png)

7. Then, the Site Binding page shows the contents you just added
![3.2.7](//mccdn.qcloud.com/static/img/0748888723acf5671ba9a1ed7ef9ebd2/image.png)

### 4. Tomcat certificate deployment

#### 4.1 Obtain the certificate

If a private key password is set when you apply for the certificate, you can download the Tomcat folder containing the keystore www.domain.com.jks.
If you do not enter a private key password when applying for the certificate, the Tomcat folder of the certificate download package contains the keystore file www.domain.com.jks and the keystore password file keystorePass.txt.
When you choose to paste the CSR, the Tomcat certificate cannot be downloaded, but has to be manually generated by converting the format as follows:

> You can generate a jks certificate with the certificate file and private key file in the Nginx folder
> Conversion tool: https://www.trustasia.com/tools/cert-converter.htm
> If you use the conversion tool, a **keystore password** must be set for further use in the configuration file when you install the certificate.

#### 4.2 Certificate installation

Configure the SSL connector. Save the file `www.domain.com.jks` in the conf directory, and then configure the file `server.xml` in the same directory:

```
<Connector port="443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
	maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
	keystoreFile="conf/www.domain.com.jks"
	keystorePass="changeit"
	clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" />
```

Note:

| Configuration File Parameter | Description |
|---------|---------|
| clientAuth | If it is set to true, Tomcat requires all SSL clients to provide a security certificate for identity verification |
| keystoreFile | Specifies where the keystore file is saved. You can specify an absolute path or the relative path to<CATALINA_HOME> (Tomcat installation directory) environment variables. If this parameter is not set, by default, Tomcat reads the file named ".keystore" from the user directory of the current operating system user. |
| keystorePass | Specifies the keystore password. (If you set a private key password when applying for the certificate, enter the private key password, otherwise enter the content of the keystore password file) |
| sslProtocol | Specifies the encryption/decryption protocol used by the socket. The default value is TLS |

#### 4.3 Security configuration for automatic redirection from http to https
Open web.xml in the conf directory. Insert the following codes between `</welcome-file-list>` and `</web-app>`, i.e. the penultimate paragraph
```
<login-config>
    <!-- Authorization setting for SSL -->
    <auth-method>CLIENT-CERT</auth-method>
    <realm-name>Client Cert Users-only Area</realm-name>
    </login-config>
    <security-constraint>
    <!-- Authorization setting for SSL -->
    <web-resource-collection>
    <web-resource-name>SSL</web-resource-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <user-data-constraint>
    <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
    </security-constraint>
```

This step is to allow the non-SSL connector to be redirected to the SSL connector. So you also need to configure server.xml:
```
<Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
	connectionTimeout="20000"
	redirectPort="443" />
```
Set the redirectPort to be the SSL connector port 443, which takes effect after restart.
