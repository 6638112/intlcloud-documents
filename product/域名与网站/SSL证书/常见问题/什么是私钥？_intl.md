SSL certificates are developed based on public-key cryptography, which encrypts information with digital keys so that the information can only be read by intended recipients after decryption.

A key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key may be disseminated widely, while the private key is known only to the owner. Information that is encrypted with the public key can be decrypted only with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.

An SSL certificate actually represents the certification of the ownership of a public key, which contains digital signing authority information, owner information of the public key, the public key, authority signature, and expiration date.
