### Does server replacement affect the ICP filing?
Yes. This mainly depends on whether the new IP is from the same service provider.
You need to pay attention to the following points when changing the IP address for ICP filing:
1. If your IP is changed from Alibaba Cloud to Tencent Cloud, you need to transfer your ICP filing to Tencent Cloud, and vice versa.
2. If you change from one Tencent Cloud IP to another Tencent Cloud IP, the fact whether operational ICP license is required matters:
A. If operational ICP license is required, you need to apply for ICP filing information change and fill in the new IP address for ICP filing to make sure that the IP in the operational ICP license is the same as the IP registered with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT);
B. If operational ICP license is not required, you do not need to apply for ICP filing information change, as ICP filing change is not mandatory in case of IP change within the same access provider. Instead, you can submit the new IP when changing other ICP filing information.
### What will happen to my ICP filing application if I haven't completed identity verification for my domain name?
You can submit an ICP filing application even if you haven't completed identity verification for your domain name, but only domain names that pass identity verification can be approved.
### What will happen to my ICP filing application if the identity-verified user types for domain name and ICP filing are different?
The identity-verified user types for domain name and ICP filing must be the same; otherwise, your application will be rejected.
### If my website that has already obtained ICP filing is not used, can I apply for ICP filing for new website?
Different provincial communications administrations have different rules for verifying information of filed website. For details, see [Rules of Provincial Communications Administrations](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243/3474). It is recommended that you deregister the not-in-use ICP filing information in time so as to avoid the deregistration of your entity by the competent communications administration due to the involvement of illegal information.
### If my website that has already obtained ICP filing is in reconstruction, can I apply for ICP filing for new website?
Different provincial communications administrations have different rules for verifying contents of filed website. For details, see [Rules of Provincial Communications Administrations](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243/3474). It is recommended that you apply for ICP filing for new website after the reconstruction is completed so as to avoid the possibility where the application is rejected because the contents of the filed website are unsatisfactory.
### What will happen to my ICP filing application if my identity document is about to expire or have already expired?
Identity document expiration will lead to rejection of your ICP filing application.
### Does ICP filing transfer affect ICP filings obtained in another province?
No.
