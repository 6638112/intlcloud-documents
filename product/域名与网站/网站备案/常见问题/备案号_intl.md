### What is an ICP filing number?
See the ICP filing number section in [ICP Filing Overview](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243/18907).

Whether a website has obtained an ICP filing number is subject to the public query on the website of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT): [website for query](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/publish/query/indexFirst.action)

### What are the requirements for the use of ICP filing number?
MIIT has the following requirements for the use of ICP filing number:  
1. The name of your organization must be displayed before the number;  
2. You need to display the number in the bottom center of the homepage of your website and hyperlink it to MIIT's website at [http://www.miibeian.gov.cn](http://www.miibeian.gov.cn).

### What should I do if "An ICP filing number already exists" is prompted for a newly purchased domain name?
If the domain name you purchased already has ICP filing information in MIIT's system that doesn't owned by you, the reason may be that the domain name was registered by another person who applied for ICP filing for it but did not deregister such information of the domain name after it expired. You can download a deregistration application form from the communications administration corresponding to the ICP filing number and apply for deregistration of the domain name's ICP filing information. After that, you can re-apply for ICP filing for the domain name. The steps are as follows:  
1. Visit [MIIT's public query website](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/publish/query/indexFirst.action) and enter the domain name in **ICP filing query** > **ICP filing information query** to check the province of the existing ICP filing information.  
2. Visit [MIIT's ICP/IP address/domain name ICP filing management system](http://www.miibeian.gov.cn/), find the province corresponding to the existing ICP filing information of the domain name in the **Administration system** module and enter.

4. Fill out the form as instructed, print and mail it together with applicable materials to the designated address. After the competent communications administration completes the deregistration, you can re-apply for ICP filing for the domain name.

### Why is an ICP filing number deregistered?
Reasons why an ICP filing number obtained from MIIT is deregistered may include:  
1. The ICP filing entity proactively applied for ICP filing deregistration directly to the competent communications administration or through the access provider.         
Possible reasons: The domain name is no longer owned by the entity; the entity no longer engages in website business; or the entity is changed or dissolved.   
2. The domain name has expired and the new domain name owner submitted an application for deregistration to the competent communications administration due to domain name conflict.    
Possible reasons: The domain name with ICP filing number has expired, but the new domain name owner couldn't submit an application for ICP filing (due to domain name conflict), so they submitted the domain name certificate and explanatory note to the competent communications administration to apply for deregistration of the ICP filing number, which then deregistered the conflicting domain name's ICP filing after verifying the actual conditions. In this case, if there is only one website under the name of the entity, the entity will be deregistered; if there are multiple websites, only the website with the conflicting domain name will be deregistered, while the ICP filing information of other websites will be retained.    
3. The website information is false or inaccurate, or some information is missing in the ICP filing, and if the access provider cancels the access, the competent communications administration will perform deregistration.    
 - In most cases, the reason why the access provider cancels the access is that the user no longer engages in website content services on the registered platform and stops using the servers of the access provider. After the access is canceled, the website becomes an empty shell and will be deregistered by the competent communications administration.    
 - The website information is false or incorrect, for example, the owner's phone number has been changed or canceled, and if this is found during the spot checks by the competent communications administration or MIIT, deregistration will be performed.  
4. If the website contains illegal information, the competent communications administration will deregister the website and entity. In serious cases, the entity will be blacklisted and prohibited from re-applying for ICP filing with its identity document number or website name.

For the specific reason for ICP filing number deregistration, please contact your provincial communications administration.

### Can a deregistered ICP filing number be recovered?
Once the number is deregistered, it cannot be recovered and the website cannot be accessed normally. To make the website accessible again, it is recommended to resubmit an application for ICP filing for the website as soon as possible.

### How long is the validity of an ICP filing number?
At present, there is no specific limitation to the validity period of ICP filing number. As long as your ICP filing information is true and correct, you apply for ICP filing information change as soon as any changes are made to your ICP filing information or apply for ICP filing transfer after changing your access provider, and your website does not contain any illegal contents, your ICP filing number will stay valid.
>**Note:**  
> If the competent communications administration finds that your application for ICP filing was for an empty-shell website or contained false information or your website contains illegal contents, it will perform ICP filing cleanup and your domain name's ICP filing will be deregistered. After that, your website will be inaccessible.
