## Why ICP Filing is Necessary

Pursuant to China's State Council Decree No. 292 "Administrative Measures for Internet Information Services" and China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Order No. 33 "Measures for the Archival Administration of Non-operational Internet Information Services", China implements a licensing system for operational internet information services and filing system for non-operational internet information services. Internet information services shall not be provided before obtaining the license or filing, otherwise the service would be deemed illegal.

Therefore, ICP filing is mandatory for mainland China server usage, and website can be launched and accessed only after obtaining ICP filing number from communications administrations.

ICP filing number is in accordance with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) official website: [website for query](http://www.miitbeian.gov.cn/publish/query/indexFirst.action)

### Impact of No ICP Filing

If your website's domain name does not have the ICP filing and is resolved to Tencent Cloud servers, Tencent Cloud will block access and redirect visitors to an ICP filing reminder page. If you need to set up a website, please complete the ICP filing application process before launching the website.

If your domain name has an ICP filing number obtained not via Tencent Cloud, and your server need to migrate or already migrated to Tencent Cloud, you need to transfer your ICP filing to us. If your website has not obtained an ICP filing via Tencent Cloud and is resolved to our servers, Tencent Cloud will block access and redirect visitors to a particular page. For details, see [ICP Filing Transfer Application](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243/19024).


### ICP Filing Exemption for Servers Outside Mainland China

ICP filing is not required if you purchase servers located in Hong Kong or foreign countries, as ICP filing is only applicable for IP addresses in mainland China.

## ICP Filing Application by Organization Outside Mainland China

Currently, organizations outside mainland China cannot apply for ICP filing. These organizations have to set up a mainland China branch and obtain state-approved organization documents to file ICP. Organizations outside mainland China may consider purchasing servers located in Hong Kong, China, as ICP filing for servers is not needed.

## Types of ICP Filing Available via Tencent Cloud

- Operational websites operating in mainland China shall apply for an value-added telecommunications business license for internet information services (i.e., ICP license). To apply for an ICP license, you must first have a valid ICP filing number. You should apply the operational ICP license at **communications administration in your province**.  For detailed requirements, visit the provincial website for operational ICP license application.

**Entity ICP filing number** format: Province name + ICP filing + entity's serial number
**Website ICP filing number** format: Province name + ICP filing + entity's serial number - website's serial number
