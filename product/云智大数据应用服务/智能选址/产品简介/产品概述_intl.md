## Overview
SS is a data intelligence product that helps with smart retail and diversified offline businesses.
It integrates massive amounts of data with machine learning to help solve various problems with site selection of brick-and-mortar stores and operations of commercial districts.

SS is dedicated to solving the three core issues in site selection:

- Evolving from "blind selection" following competitors to "targeted selection" of premium sites;
- Evolving from the macroscopic analysis of foot traffic at the commercial district level to the in-depth analysis of potential customer groups;
- Evolving from research and report to turnover prediction at the root level.

## Features
### Exploration of Potential Customer Groups
- SS displays the spheres of influence of primary, secondary and peripheral commercial districts in the city through foot traffic heat maps.

### Preferred Target Area 
- On the basis of the detected foot traffic heat, SS incorporates additional information about your own stores, competing stores and allying brands to identify commercially uncovered areas.
- It then uses the 5C site selection method to comprehensively evaluate multiple factors and automatically recommend an optimal area for your new site by taking into account your choices of administrative district and business hours of the site.
- Further, it can help you build a default scoring weight system where the weights of factors can be customized on demand according to the category, typical customer evaluation and expert assessment of your brand.

### Directed Selection from Multiple Site Candidates 
- SS can dig into precise site candidates in the selected area to more scientifically delineate the ideal part of a commercial district based on walk-distance isochrone maps.
- The specific "sales per square kilometer" scores of the candidates are calculated as the decision basis for final selection.
