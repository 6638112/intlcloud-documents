## One-click Smart Site Selection
Where is the ideal target area? How to find the right area for your business? How to distinguish the advantages and disadvantages of the selected area?
In order to help with your large-scale urban store coverage strategy in the new era of smart retail, SS recommends ideal sites with one click based on the administrative district and analysis period you select.

SS recommends ideal sites accurate to within a 100 m x 100 m area, and the recommended sites can be filtered and scored on demand. The recommendation process comprehensively assesses the foot traffic, population size, potential customer concentration, commercial atmosphere and competition intensity in each area and quantifies them as model scores, simplifying the workload that otherwise would take a few months to complete into a one-click report generated in just seconds and changing the needle-in-a-haystack passive selection to a more targeted active solution.
