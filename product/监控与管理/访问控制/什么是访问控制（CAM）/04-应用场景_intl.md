### Enterprise sub-account permission management

For security purposes, TencentCloud enables you to grant the employees minimum access permission to the enterprise's cloud resources according to their job duties. Scenario: A company has a variety of TencentCloud resources (CVM, VPC instances, CDN instances, COS buckets and objects, etc.) and employees with different roles (developers, testers, OPS personnel, etc.), where developers and testers who work on specific project need to read and write related TencentCloud resources on development servers and test servers respectively, and IT staff purchase and maintain those servers.  When the responsibilities or projects of an employee have changed, the corresponding permissions should be revoked.

### Cross-enterprise permission management

You can share TencentCloud resources among enterprises.
Scenario: A company who outsources IT operations of TencentCloud - in order to focus on product R&D - should revoke all permissions that have been granted to the third-party as soon as the outsourcing service contracts are terminated.
