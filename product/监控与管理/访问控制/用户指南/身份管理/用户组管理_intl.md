## Overview
In order to assign permissions to the user groups according to their roles, you can add all the users with the same role in the same user group, and associate policies that define the permissions to that group. This helps improve your work efficiency.
After associating policies to a user group, you automatically grant permissions described by the polices to the users. This works for batch authorization.
