A role is similar to a Tencent Cloud user. It can be regarded as a "virtual account" in Tencent Cloud. A role can also be assigned a policy to get the permissions to approve or reject actions in Tencent Cloud. It can be introduced by any Tencent Cloud account, and is not exclusively associated with one single account. A role does not have an associated persistent certificate (password or access key). A primary account will use a persistent certificate only when applying for a role. When a user assumes a role, a dynamic temporary certificate will be created and provided to the user for accessing resources. This allows users to access their cloud resources by calling the open APIs for Tencent Cloud basic services with a temporary key signature.

An object that can apply to assume a role is called a role entity. Tencent Cloud supports two types of role entities: Tencent Cloud accounts and Tencent Cloud services supporting roles. For example, you may need to grant temporary access to your resources to users in your account or to users in another Tencent Cloud primary account. Or you need to allow a Tencent Cloud product service to access your resources without embedding the key persistently in the product service. This ensures you wonâ€™t experience any security problem due to the difficulty in changing keys and data leaks from intercepted keys.
