A role is similar to a Tencent Cloud user,  where you can see a role as a  "virtual account"  and give it permission policies that determine what it can or cannot do in Tencent Cloud. A role can be assumable by any of Tencent Cloud accounts and is not exclusively associated with one single account. Although a primary account uses long-term credentials such as a password or access keys when creating a role, a role does not have long-term credentials associated with it.  When you assume a role, you receive dynamic temporary security credentials to access resources via the role. Specifically, it allows you to use temporary keys and signatures to access to your cloud resources via open Tencent Cloud APIs.

An object that can apply for assuming a role is called a role entity. Tencent Cloud supports two types of role entities: Tencent Cloud accounts and Tencent Cloud services supporting roles. For example, you may need to grant users in your account or another Tencent Cloud primary account temporary access to resources in your account. Or you may need to allow a Tencent Cloud product service to access your resources but you don't want the persistent key accessed by that product service. Creating a role thus can prevent security problems due to credential leakage, which may be caused by the difficulty of rotating keys.
