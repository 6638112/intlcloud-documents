When you no longer need a role, you can delete the role by following these steps:
>**Note:**
>When you delete a **service role**, the authorization information associated with this role will be deleted as well. This means that the product services or accounts who own the role are no longer able to use this role.


1. Log in to the CAM console and go to the [Role Management](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/role).
2. On the role list, select the role you want to delete and click **Delete** in **Operation**. 
3. Before you delete a service role, you need to confirm that you are deleting the right role. Deleting the role will delete the authorization information associated with this role. Click **OK** to delete the role. Now the owner of this role (product service or account) can no longer use this role.
