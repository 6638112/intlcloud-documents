In the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/video), select **Data Center** > **Data Analysis** where statistics about **Access** and **Playback** are provided. The access statistics page is displayed by default.

## Access Statistics

- The time dimensions of the access statistics include today, yesterday, the past 7 days, the past 30 days, and any custom time period in the past 30 days. In addition to the time dimensions, you can filter the access statistics by domain name, region, and ISP.
- The data overview metrics are the total requests and the total independent IP access requests for the specified time period.
	- Total independent IP access requests: This counts the IPs of the accessing clients in the log in a de-duplicated manner:
		- If the time range is less than or equal to one day, a deduplicated IPs curve with a 5-minute granularity is provided.
		- The domain name statistics are counted by deduplicating the daily active quantity in the full day. If there are multiple domain names, the statistics are counted by accumulating the daily active quantity of every domain name with a 5-minute granularity.
	- Total requests: The total number of requests to the domain name in the specified time period.
- The requests trend, independent IP access requests trend, requests by ISP, and top 10 provinces for requests are graphically displayed.
- There is a delay of around 10 minutes for access statistics.
