In the [VOD console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/video), select **Data Center** > **Data Analysis**, you will see the statistics about **Access** and **Playback**. The default page shows access statistics

## Access Statistics

- You can see the access statistics for today, yesterday, past 7 days, and past 30 days, and you can retrieve the statistics for any time period in the past 30 days. Also, you can filter the statistics by domain name, region, and ISP.
- The following statistics are the key statistics that describe the total requests and unique IP of the requests in a given time period.
    - Total independent IP access requests: The number of unique requests received. The duplicated IP of the request are removed in the logs.
        - If the time period is less than or equal to one day, you see a curve of the unique IP count with a unit of 5 minutes.
        - The domain name statistics are calculated using unique IPs of the requests on a daily basis. If there are multiple domain names, the statistics are counted by accumulating the daily active quantity of every domain name with a 5-minute granularity.
    - Total requests: The total number of requests received by the domain name in a given time period.
- You see the graphs/figures show the trends of the counts of requests, the requests sent from the unique IPs and the requests by ISP, and the top 10 provinces where the requests were sent.
- You may need to wait for about 10 minutes to get the statistics delivered.
