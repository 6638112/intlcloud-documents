## Traffic and Bandwidth
The LVB traffic and bandwidth statistics detail the downstream traffic and bandwidth generated by connecting the user to the cache origin server. LVB offers two pay-as-you-go billing plans: Bill-by-traffic or Bill-by-bandwidth. The default plan for new users is bill-by-traffic. 

### Bill-by-traffic
LVB can be billed by daily traffic in a tiered manner at a price as shown in the table below:

| Traffic tier | Price (CNY/GB/day) | 
|---------|---------|
|0 - 500GB|	0.26|
|500GB (inclusive) - 2TB|0.25|
|2TB (inclusive) - 50TB|	0.23|
|50TB (inclusive) -100TB	|0.19|
|≥100TB	|0.16|

**Billing:**
1. Billable item: The downstream traffic generated by LVB watching within mainland China.
2. Billing method: Pay-as-you-go.
3. Billing cycle: The service is charged by traffic on a daily basis at 10 o'clock the next day, subject to the billing statement.
4. Billing rules: The service is charged by multiplying the accumulated traffic on a natural day by the unit price at the corresponding tier.
5. Billing example:
       1. If a LVB session lasts for one hour at a bit rate of 500Kbps and is watched by 100 users, the traffic consumed is about:
          500/8 x 3600 x 100 = 22500000KB = 22.5GB
       2. If you use the LVB service on January 1, 2019 which generates 22.5GB of downstream traffic, the LVB traffic bill you need to pay on January 2 is as follows:
          Daily LVB fee = 0.26 (CNY/GB) x 22.5 (GB) = CNY 5.85

### Bill-by-bandwidth
LVB can be billed by daily peak bandwidth in a tiered manner at a price as shown in the table below:

| Bandwidth tier | Price (CNY/Mbps/day) | 
|---------|---------|
|0 - 500Mbps|	0.64|
|500Mbps (inclusive) - 5Gbps|0.62|
|5Gbps (inclusive) - 20Gbps|	0.59|
|≥20Gbps	|0.58|

3. Billing cycle: The service is charged by bandwidth on a daily basis at 10 o'clock the next day, subject to the billing statement.
4. Billing rules: The service is charged by multiplying the peak bandwidth on a natural day by the unit price at the corresponding tier.
5. Billing example:
       1. If a LVB session lasts for one hour at a bit rate of 500Kbps and is watched by 100 users, the bandwidth consumed is about:
          500Kbps x 100 = 50000Kbps = 50Mbps
       2. If you use the LVB service on January 1, 2019 which generates 50Mbps of downstream bandwidth, the LVB bandwidth bill you need to pay on January 2 is as follows:
          Daily LVB bandwidth fee = 0.64 (CNY/Mbps/day) x 50 (Mbps) = CNY 32

>? If your live broadcasting business size is large and the consumption of Tencent Cloud resources has exceeded or is expected to exceed CNY 50,000, the daily billing method may not meet your needs. You can contact Tencent Cloud business team for business negotiation on an appropriate billing method and pricing.

## LVB Transcoding
LVB provides standard transcoding and ultra-fast HD transcoding services which are billed on the basis of the actually used encoding method, transcoding resolution and transcoding duration. The transcoding feature is disabled by default. If you need to use it, you can enable it in the LVB console or through cloud API. **If you use the watermarking or stream mixing feature, transcoding fees will also be incurred, and the resolution will be the same as the resolution of the live stream to which the watermark is added.** The prices of standard transcoding and ultra-fast HD transcoding are as shown in the table below:
>! Transcoding pricing will take effect on January 1, 2019.

>! Transcoding fee = Encoding method - resolution - price x transcoding duration. If no transcoding service is used, no fees will be incurred.

**Billing:**
1. Billable item: The duration of live stream transcoding (or the duration of the mixed stream or the live stream to which the watermark is added if the stream mixing or watermarking feature is enabled).
2. Billing method: Pay-as-you-go.
3. Billing cycle: The transcoding service is charged on a daily basis at 10 o'clock the next day. If your account is billed on a monthly basis, the transcoding service will be charged monthly during the 1st to 5th days the next month.
4. Billing rules: The service is charged by multiplying the transcoding duration in different transcoding methods and resolutions on a natural day by the corresponding unit price.
5. Billing example:
		If you use LVB transcoding and watermarking service on January 1, 2019, where live stream A is transcoded to H.264_720P for one hour and live stream B is watermarked at 480p for 30 minutes, the LVB transcoding bill you need to pay on January 2 is as follows:
		Daily live transcoding fee = 0.0325 (CNY/minute) x 60 (minutes) + 0.016 (CNY/minute) x 30 (minutes) = CNY 2.43

5. Billing example:
		If you use ultra-fast HD transcoding service on January 1, 2019, where live stream A is transcoded to ultra-fast HD at 720p for one hour and live stream B is transcoded to ultra-fast HD at 480p for 30 minutes, the ultra-fast HD LVB transcoding bill you need to pay on January 2 is as follows:
		Daily ultra-fast HD LVB transcoding fee = 0.1256 (CNY/minute) x 60 (minutes) + 0.066 (CNY/minute) x 30 (minutes) = CNY 9.516
		
## Live Recording
LVB can record the live stream and stores it in VOD. The recording feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in the console or through cloud API. Use of the recording feature will incur a fee, and the peak number of concurrent LVB recording channels in the current month is used as the billable item. The detailed pricing is as follows:

| Billing type | Price (CNY/channel/month) |
|---------|---------|
| Peak number of recording channels |30 | 

**Billing:**
1. Billable item: The number of LVB recording channels.
2. Billing method: Pay-as-you-go.
3. Billing cycle: The service is charged on a monthly basis during the 1st to 5th days the next month, subject to the billing statement.
4. Billing rules: The service is charged by multiplying the peak number of concurrent LVB recording channels in a natural month by the unit price. One recording file is counted as one channel of recording stream. For example, if MP4 and HLS files are recorded for the same stream ID, they will be counted as two channels of recording streams.
5. Billing example:
		If you use the LVB recording service from January 1 to February 1, 2019, and the peak number of recording channels in the month is 10, then the live recording bill you need to pay on February 2 is as follows:
		LVB recording fee for January  = 30 (CNY/channel/month) x 10 (channels) = CNY 300

## LVB Screencapture
LVB can take screenshots of the live stream. The screencapture feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in the console or through cloud API. Use of the screencapture feature will incur a fee. There are 1,000 screenshots available free of charge per month, and fees will be charged if more screenshots are taken, with the total number of screenshots taken in the current month as the billable item. The detailed pricing is as follows:

| Screenshots | Price (CNY/thousand screenshots) | Note |
|---------|---------|-----|
|< 1,000 | CNY 0 | 1,000 screenshots are available free of charge per month |
|≥ 1,000 | CNY 0.1/thousand screenshots | If less than 1,000 screenshots are taken in a month, they will be counted as 1,000 ones |

**Billing:**
1. Billable item: The number of LVB screenshots.
2. Billing method: Pay-as-you-go.

		If you use the LVB screencapture service from January 1 to February 1, 2019, and a total of 168,000 screenshots are taken in the month, then the LVB screencapture bill you need to pay on February 2 is as follows:
		LVB screencapture fee for January = 0.1 (CNY/thousand screenshots) x (168 - 1) thousand screenshots = CNY 16.7

## Intelligent Porn Detection
LVB can intelligently detect pornography in the live stream. The porn detection feature is disabled by default and can be enabled in the console or through cloud API. As the porn detection service needs to first take screenshots of the live stream, the fees incurred will include two parts: fees for porn detection and fees for screencapture. There are 1,000 screenshots available for porn detection free of charge per month, and fees will be charged if more screenshots are taken, with the total number of screenshots detected for porn in the current month as the billable item. The detailed pricing is as follows:

| Screenshots | Price (CNY/thousand screenshots) | Note |
|---------|---------|-----|
|< 1,000 | CNY 0 | 1,000 screenshots are available for porn detection free of charge per month |
