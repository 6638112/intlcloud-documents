When the Tencent Cloud billing system detects that the balance of your Tencent Cloud account is insufficient, it will remind you to top up. You have 24 hours to top up after your account falls into arrears. If your account is not topped up within the time limit, Tencent Cloud LVB service will be suspended. If you top up your account within 24 hours of arrears, your LVB service will not be affected.
After your account is in arrears, the VOD files generated by LVB recording will not be accessible. The LVB screenshots stored in COS will follow the rules in the [notes for service suspension](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/10044) of COS. Please pay attention accordingly.
If you no longer use the Tencent Cloud LVB service, you need to deactivate it. Please contact us through your Tencent Cloud business manager or a [ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category).
