You will pay for the basic Tencent Cloud LVB service and value-added services that you have signed up for. 
Specifically, the basic service billing includes the pay-as-you-go **traffic/bandwidth** fee. That is, you pay for the downlink traffic/bandwidth generated by connecting the user and the cache origin server.
Value-added services include **LVB transcoding**, **LVB recording**, **LVB screen capture** and **intelligent porn detection**. You only pay for what you use for these services and pay after using the services.
