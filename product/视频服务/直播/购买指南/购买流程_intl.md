LVB is pay-as-you-go. Therefore, you can simply register a Tencent Cloud account and activate LVB to use it.

## Signing up for a Tencent Cloud account
If you already have a Tencent Cloud account, you can ignore this step. Otherwise, please sign up for one by following the instructions in [Sign up for Tencent Cloud](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/17985). Tencent Cloud accounts can be registered with an email address.
## Complete Identity Verification
If you have already completed identity verification for your Tencent Cloud account, you can ignore this step. Otherwise, please do so by following the instructions in [Identity Verification Guide](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629). After your personal or organizational identity is verified, you can activate the LVB service.
## Activating LVB
Go to the [LVB console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live) page, select [I agree to the Tencent Cloud Service Agreement](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/301/1967) and click **Activate** to activate the LVB service for use.
