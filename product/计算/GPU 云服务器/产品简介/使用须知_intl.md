#### 1. Back up Data
GPU Cloud Computing provides powerful computing capacities. GN2 and GN8 are mounted with local SSD. Make sure to back up data periodically to ensure data security and prevent data loss in extreme circumstances.
To ensure data security, you can also purchase and mount elastic cloud disks separately.
#### 2. Renew in Time
You will receive an expiration notice 7 days before the expiration of the GPU instance. Renew in time if you want to continue using it. Otherwise, the instance will be shut down, disconnected and placed in the Recycle Bin once it expires. Be sure to renew in time or back up your data before expiration date.
#### 3. Connect External Devices
Currently, you cannot use external hardware devices (such as hardware protection dongles, USB disks, external disks, and U-keys for banks) directly on GPU instances.
#### 4. Upgrade Configuration
You cannot upgrade or degrade specification of GPU instances.
#### 5. Prohibition Notes
