## Mass Computing Processing
GPU instances provide powerful computing capabilities to process mass data, such as search, big data recommendation, and intelligent input method:
	•	With GPU instances, the data operation that used to take several days now only takes few hours.
	•	Cluster computing that used to be implemented using dozens of CPU instances is now completed with a single GPU instance.

## Deep Learning Model
GPU instance serves as a training platform for deep learning:
1.	GPU instance can directly accelerate the computing service and communicate externally.
2.	GPU instance can be used in combination with CVM which provides computing platform for GPU instance.
3.	COS provides GPU instance with cloud storage service for massive data.
