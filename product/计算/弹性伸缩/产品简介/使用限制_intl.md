- Currently supported regions include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Hong Kong, Singapore, Mumbai, Silicon Valley, Virginia, Toronto, and Moscow.
- Up to 20 launch configurations can be created per user per region.
- Up to 20 scaling groups can be created per user.
- One scaling group can correspond to only one launch configuration.
- Up to 500 CVM instances can be produced by AS per region.
- Up to 200 CVM instances can be produced by AS per scaling group.
- Up to 100 scaling policies and up to 10 scheduled tasks can be created per scaling group.
- The number of CVMs in all scaling groups cannot exceed the maximum number of IPs that the VPC subnet can provide.
- Currently, AS does not support vertical scaling, which means it cannot automatically scale the CPU, memory, and bandwidth of CVM instances.
- Automatic scaling and launch configurations are both region-based; therefore, you can only launch or terminate CVM instances in the same region.
