CDH is a dedicated physical server equipped with a virtualized environment and having the following benefits:

## Exclusive Resources
After purchasing a CDH, you can use the host resources exclusively which are physically isolated and can be independently planned for use to avoid competition from resources of other tenants.

## Flexible Creation
Dedicated CVM instances with customized spec can be created on the specified CDH and independently planned for the use of host resources. The dedicated CVM instance specs support customization, allowing for flexible configuration and breaking the limitations of instance specs to ensure business performance while making full use of physical server resources. In addition, the instances support configuration adjustment in shut-down state and network adjustment in powered-on state.

## Security and Compliance
The host resources are physically isolated. CPU, memory, disk and network resources are all dedicated to one single tenant.
Physical machine-grade resource isolation provides sensitive business data protection and disk demagnetizing capabilities to meet the firm regulatory requirements in the finance industry.

## Management and Monitoring
CDHs and dedicated CVM instances can be managed and monitored in multiple dimensions with free of charge Cloud Monitor services and support a wide variety of real-time alerts.

## Lightweight Assets
On-demand purchase, minute-level delivery and Tencent Cloud OPS services with unified standards ensure stable resource operation without having to concern over underlying OPS, reducing labor and OPS costs and allowing you to focus on core businesses.

## Inherent CVM Features
An exclusive instance is a CVM instance created on CDH that supports various CVM functions such as images, security groups, configuration adjustments and SSH keys. Further, these functions can be used just like with an ordinary CVM instance.
