Dedicated CVM instances on the CDH instance support quick and easy adjustment of configuration subject to the remaining available resources on the host. You can freely adjust the instance configuration on demand at any time to meet different business needs in different periods.

## Precautions
- When the instance is in **Shutdown** state, it can be modified directly in the console.
- When the instance is in **Running** state, you have to agree to a forced shutdown before making adjustments.

## Steps
1. Log in to the [CVM Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cvm/).
2. On the instance to be adjusted, click **More** > **CVM settings** > **Adjust configuration** in the Operation column on the right.
