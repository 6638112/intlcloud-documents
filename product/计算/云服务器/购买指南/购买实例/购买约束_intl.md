## Purchase Limits for Prepaid CVM Instances


For different availability zones, Tencent Cloud allocates a fixed quota of prepaid monthly and yearly package CVMs for each user. 
-  For each user in each availability zone, quota for newly purchased (not net increase) prepaid CVM instances is 150. Quotas for different availability zones are calculated separately.
-  Quota for prepaid CVM instances only includes **newly purchased** instances quantities. Existing CVMs and expired CVMs are not included.
-  Quota is based on calendar month.
For example:
	For example, quota for February 2016 is from February 1st 00:00:00 to February 29th 23:59:59; quota for May 2017 is from May 1st 00:00:00 to May 31st 23:59:59.
- If the number of instances you need exceeds the regional quota limit, you can submit an application for quota increase. We will evaluate and increase your quota if the application is approved. Quota increase is valid for the current calendar month only and will change back to the original value starting the 1st of the following month.
**Applying for quota increase:**
[Submit a request](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=6&level2_id=7&source=0). Select **Application for increasing CVM quota** and choose your CVM type. Enter the target region, target quota and CVM configuration, as well as your reason for application and problem description. Fill out your mobile number and clickÂ **Submit a request**.
>**Note:**
> - If you are applying only for one availability zone or if you are trying to get the same quota for multiple availability zones, simply select availability zone(s) and enter the target quota.
> - If you want to have different quotas for different availability zones, you need to apply separately.
