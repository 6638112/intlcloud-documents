To ensure quality, Tencent Cloud offers BGP multi-line access for all Internet service provider access. You can choose a billing method that best fit your business needs.

### Bill-by-traffic

CVMs are billed by the public network outbound traffic (in GB).
CVM bill is based on the gigabyte amount of public network outbound traffic.
**Characteristics:** CVM has simple billing rules and is based on your usage, which reduces cost for customers with fluctuating network demands. You can set a bandwidth cap to avoid traffic surge fees, and once the cap is reached, packet loss will occur by default and no other costs will be incurred.



>**Note:**
>If the bandwidth is set to 0 Mbps, the CVM instance is not assigned with a public IP. In this case, the outbound traffic is not supported and the CVM instance cannot be used as public gateway. Please choose with caution.
