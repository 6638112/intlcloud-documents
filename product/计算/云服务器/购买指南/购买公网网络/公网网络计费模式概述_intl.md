To ensure quality, Tencent Cloud offers BGP multi-line access for all Internet service provider access. You can choose a billing method that best fit your business needs.

### Bill-by-traffic

CVM bill is based on the gigabyte amount of public network outbound traffic.
**Characteristics:** CVM has simple billing rules and is based on your usage, which reduces cost for customers with fluctuating network demands. You can set a bandwidth cap to avoid traffic surge fees. Once the cap is reached, packet loss will occur by default and no other costs will be incurred.



>**Note:**
>If you choose 0 Mbps bandwidth, CVM instance will not have public IP or outbound traffic, and cannot be used as public gateway. Give careful consideration to 0 Mbps bandwidth.
