BGP multi-line access is provided by Tencent Cloud for all ISPs to ensure the link quality. You can choose a billing method based on your business needs.

### Bill-by-traffic

CVMs are billed by the public network outbound traffic (in GB).
**Feature:** Billing by traffic is simple on a pay-as-you-go basis and is suitable for customers with fluctuating network requirements to cut cost. To avoid a high cost caused by the traffic surge, you can set a bandwidth cap. If this limit is exceeded, packet loss occurs by default with no cost incurred.



>**Note:**
>If the bandwidth is set to 0 Mbps, the CVM instance is not assigned with a public IP. In this case, the outbound traffic is not supported and the CVM instance cannot be used as public gateway. Please choose with caution.

<!--Now, you can take a further look at [Exclusive Network Billing]() and [Shared Network Billing]() based on the network type of your CVM.-->
