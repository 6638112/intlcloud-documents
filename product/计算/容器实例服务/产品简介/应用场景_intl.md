## Application Hosting
Container instances are ideal workload for serverless applications. With the image of an application's container, you can run the application by making simple configurations at the lowest cost. For example, you can perform an application verification, crawl a website, deploy a web service, etc. Any simple applications that support containers can be deployed using container instances. Besides, container instances can also host stateful applications by specifying a fixed public IP and using persistent cache.

## Computing Jobs
Container instances are the easiest choice to run containers on Tencent Cloud. They can start in batch within seconds, support logic termination and auto release, and communicate with other resources via a private network, thus suitable for computing jobs. From small-scale algorithm verification and large-scale batch computing, to serial tasks using CPU and parallel tasks using GPU, it is recommended to use a container instance as the workload.
