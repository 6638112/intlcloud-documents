### At what confidence level will image-based liveness detection conclude that the person in the image is a real person?
The confidence level recommended by the algorithm is 87 which can be adjusted based on your actual business needs.

### Does image-based liveness detection support video recognition?
It only supports detecting images. It is recommended to screencap the video for recognition.


### In what scenarios can image-based liveness detection be used?
It is recommended to use it in the mobile selfie scenario; otherwise, the reference value of the liveness score will be significantly reduced. It can be used only if the requirement for attack defense is not high. If the security requirement is high, it is better to use lip language-based liveness detection.
