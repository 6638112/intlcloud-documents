In **System Management** > **People management**, you can manage accounts, roles and groups.
Super admins and admins can add customer service agents, assign permissions and set groups for shared use of the system. Before adding an agent, you must confirm that there are available agent roles; otherwise, please [purchase a bot](https://buy.cloud.tencent.com/ticsr) first.

## Account Management              
In **System Management** > **People management**, select the **Account management** tab and click **Add** in the upper left corner to add a new user.
                      
> The account registered at the official website is a super admin account by default (which cannot be deleted). After login, you can create admins and agents (the default account and password will be sent to you via email and can be used directly for login). When adding a new agent, you need to enter the name, email, employee number, role and agent group information.

The roles are divided into admins and agents by default. You can also configure the permissions of a role based on your own needs.

- An **admin** has all the permissions (as an admin has higher level of permissions, please be cautious when adding one); the knowledge points added by an admin can be used directly with no review required.
- An **agent** can only use the knowledge point function and agent workbench. Knowledge points added by an agent will be placed in "Pending tasks" and visible in the knowledge base only after approved by an admin (things to be reviewed include professional Q&As, chitchats, synonyms and batch import). The addition of similar questions and editing of the knowledge base are not subject to review and can take effect directly.
