## Knowledge Graph-based Conversations
Traditional Q&A database is unable to intepret incomplete questions or handle excessive inquiries. Tencent Big Data AI team built operation models using field-specific knowledge graphs and then realized multi-round conversation system. The system uses natural language understanding technology to identify parts of customer intentions, search knowledge graph network and ask customers for explanations. The system also has context memory.

## Strong Learning Model and Cold Start Solution Based on Deep Migration Learning
TICSR's technology solution integrates a traditional machine learning model with a deep learning model where the former captures the information matching the characters, while the latter captures the semantic correlation among questions. The combination of the two can greatly improve the model stability under different data volumes.

For traditional customer service systems based on question matching, if there are too few similar questions, it is impossible to train a sufficiently stable model. To address this pain point, TICSR's deep migration learning scheme uses some large corpora in non-specific fields (not to be provided by the user) to train the basic model, and then use the user-supplied small corpus for migration learning to get the fusion model, so that even if the cold start Q&A library is imperfect, a stable model can be trained. Offline evaluation experiments have proven that when the number of similar questions is 1, the accuracy of the deep migration learning model is 40% higher than that of the traditional model, and if the number is 5, the accuracy improvement can be 100%.

## Corpus Mining Scheme Based on Big Data Platform
Based on Tencent's big data warehouse, we can mine customer questions in specific field corpus (industry-related) that can be used for training deep learning models or creating user-specific Q&A libraries. This data solution is a unique advantage of the Tencent Big Data team, which helps the user build a Q&A library more effectively during the cold start phase.
