### Cluster
A cluster is the basic unit of Snova and usually consists of 2 master nodes and multiple compute nodes. You can build multiple clusters in multiple locations based on your actual business needs.

### Compute Node
A compute node is the basic storage and computing unit of the cluster. A cluster must have at least two nodes. As the number of nodes increases, the cluster capacity and performance can be linearly increased.

### Node Model
A node model is a version of compute node with specific resource specifications, including CPU, memory, disk and so on. Different node models have different performance and storage capacities.

### Number of Nodes
This refers to the number of compute nodes in each cluster. The minimum order quantity is 2. Different node models have different limits on the number of nodes.

### MPP
Massively parallel processing (MMP) is a distributed shared-nothing computing architecture that improves performance by simultaneously parallel computing with multiple shared-nothing nodes.
