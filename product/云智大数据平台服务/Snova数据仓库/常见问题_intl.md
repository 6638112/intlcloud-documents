### What is a Snova cluster?
A cluster is the basic unit of Snova and usually consists of 2 master nodes and multiple compute nodes. You can build multiple clusters in multiple locations based on your actual business needs.

### What is a compute node?
A compute node is the basic storage and computing unit of the cluster. A cluster must have at least two nodes. As the number of nodes increases, the cluster capacity and performance can be linearly increased.

### What is node model?
A node model is a version of compute node with specific resource specifications, including CPU, memory, disk and so on. Different node models have different performance and storage capacities.

### In which regions and availability zones can Snova be used?
Snova can be used in four regions in the public cloud environment during the internal trial period: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Singapore. It is recommended that you select a region that is consistent with the data source.

### What sources of data are supported?
Data from Tencent Cloud products such as CDB, CKafka and EMR can be seamlessly imported into Snova for analysis and computation.

### Does Snova support machine learning?
Snova supports a wide variety of extension libraries, but this feature is temporarily unavailable during the internal trial period. Therefore, extension libraries for machine learning are not supported for the time being. We will roll out this feature in future releases. Please stay tuned.
