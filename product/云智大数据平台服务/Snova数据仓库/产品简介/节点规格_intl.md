Snova supports the following two node families:

- Compute-intensive: This family of nodes start with nc in name and feature better I/O capabilities for higher performance;
- Storage-intensive: This family of nodes start with ns in name and feature larger and more affordable storage capacities to meet higher storage needs.

When selecting node family, it is recommended that you choose based on your requirements for storage space and computing power.

In addition, Snova supports COS-based scaling with external tables and can compress data on external storage using gzip. Data that does not involve real-time computation can be stored in external storage to further reduce storage costs.
