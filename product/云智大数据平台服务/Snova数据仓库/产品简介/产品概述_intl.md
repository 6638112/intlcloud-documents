## Overview
Snova provides you with a simple, fast and affordable petabyte-level cloud data warehousing solution. With Snova, you can create an enterprise-class cloud data warehouse with hundreds of nodes in just minutes and efficiently perform routine maintenance tasks. A wide variety of open-source PostgreSQL tools are made available to conduct ad hoc queries and analysis, ETL processing and visual exploration of massive amounts of data in Snova. Moreover, with the seamless integration feature of Snova cloud data, petabytes of data stored in data engines such as COS, CDB and ES can be analyzed with ease.

## Benefits
### Elastic Scaling 
Snova provides convenient elastic scaling, enabling the horizontal or vertical scaling of hundreds of nodes in through Cloud Console or Cloud API with just a few clicks. The computing unit, CPU, memory and storage capacity proportionally can be scaled up based on business needs to improve performance and meet the demands of business growth.  

### Ease of Use 
By operating in the console, tasks like cluster management, monitoring and maintenance can be completed without your having to worry about the heavy OPS of the underlying infrastructure. Snova is fully compatible with the ANSI SQL 2008 standard, enabling the construction of enterprise-class data warehouses using standard SQL. It supports direct queries of COS data without the need for data preloading. 

### Seamless Integration 
Snova supports the expansion of COS cloud storage, making it possible to achieve unlimited storage capacity. Working together with a variety of tools and solutions, it supports high-speed data import from multiple sources such as traditional relational databases, CKafka and SCS to achieve convergent analysis of multi-source cloud data.  

### Best-in-class Performance 
Snova's storage capacity and computational capability can be scaled linearly based on the MPP framework for distributed high-concurrency processing. Further, Snova supports hybrid row-column storage allowing you to select the best storage solution based on your business needs. The query engine is deeply optimized, offering a query efficiency several times that of traditional data warehouses.  

### Security and Reliability 
Dual-node sync redundancy enables imperceptible failover and disaster recovery backup. Distributed deployment and triple-layer protection of computing units, servers and cabinets enhance the security of critical data infrastructure. User clusters are deployed separately and support VPC isolation, offering multiple layers of data access security.
