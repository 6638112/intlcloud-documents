### Operational Analysis and Decision-making
In many fields such as finance and retail, it is essential to aggregate and analyze business data on sales, assets and the supply chain in order to understand corporate operational conditions through data and improve decision-making accuracy and efficiency.
Data distributed across CDB, Oracle and PostgreSQL can be imported into Snova through synchronization or using ETL tools and facilitate operational decision-making by leveraging Snova's ability to analyze multi-source heterogeneous data.

### Analysis of Large Volumes of Logs
In fields such as Internet-based finance, gaming and O2O, it is essential to have an affordable method for analyzing petabytes of structured or semi-structured data about user behaviors, system logs and orders.
You can store massive amounts of data directly in COS without having to import the data into Snova in advance. Then, simply write SQL statements to quickly analyze and apply the data stored in COS.

### Real-time Insight into User Behaviors
In the Internet and gaming industries, real-time analysis of user behaviors helps with the optimization of operational strategies and improvement of resource operations efficiency.

User's real-time behavior data can be filtered, sorted, aggregated and analyzed by Stream Compute Service, and then the results can be synced to Snova in real time, which enables you to quickly perceive user behavior trends and adjust operational strategies thanks to its powerful SQL analysis capability and query efficiency.
