## Overview
Based on the industry-leading Apache Spark framework, Tencent Sparkling Data Warehouse Suite ("Sparkling" for short) provides you with a fully-managed, easy-to-use and high-performance petabyte-level cloud data warehousing solution. It enables you to create an enterprise-grade distributed cloud data warehouse with thousands of nodes that can be efficiently scaled as needed. In addition, it supports data visualization and intelligent analysis to help you tap into the value of data.

## Features
### Elastic Scaling
Sparkling comes with powerful elastic scalability. Computation and storage are separated and worker nodes of the cluster are divided into core nodes and elastic compute nodes. Manual and automated scale-out of high numbers of nodes and scale-up/down of computing and storing devices can be achieved fast using Data Studio or Cloud API. Automated elastic scale-in is available to elastic compute nodes as business scale changes.

### Data Integration
Sparkling supports integration with and ingestion of data from various heterogeneous sources. Data from traditional relational databases, COS, local files and K-V data storage can be extracted, transformed and loaded into the storage of Sparkling using the Data Studio console.

### Cluster Management
The exclusive usage mode of Sparkling provides cluster management and monitoring modules that support cluster creation, automatic scaling, cluster configuration, start/stop and intelligent resource monitoring and alarming. Daily OPS and cluster performance tuning can be performed using the cluster management function.

### Data Development
Sparkling is equipped with a data development module based on the Notebook architecture for ETL, data processing, data computation and more. The trial version currently only supports SQL. More scripting languages such as Python, Scala, Java and R will be supported in the future.

### Task Management
Sparkling offers a task scheduling and management module that supports time-driven and event-driven DAG task scheduling. Meanwhile, it features comprehensive task monitoring to facilitate ETL and processing of OPS data.
