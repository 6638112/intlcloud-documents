>!This is a legacy API which has been hidden and will no longer be updated. We recommend using the new [CMQ API 3.0](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/406/36408?!editLang=en&!preview) which is standardized and faster.

## Interface description

This API (DeleteQueue) is used to delete a created queue.

- Domain name requested by public network API: `https://cmq-queue-{$region}.api.qcloud.com`
- Domain name requested by private network API: `http://cmq-queue-{$region}.api.tencentyun.com`

The above **{$region} in the domain name needs to be replaced with a specific region** : gz (Guangzhou), sh (Shanghai), bj (Beijing), shjr (Shanghai Financial), szjr (Shenzhen Financial), hk (China Hong Kong), cd (Chengdu), ca (North American), usw (Maxi), sg (Singapore). The region value in the common parameters should be consistent with the region value of the domain name. If there is any inconsistency, the request will be sent to the region specified by the domain name region based on the region value of the domain name.

>? At any time (including during internal testing), if the public network downstream Traffic is generated by using a public network domain name, Traffic and cost will be charged. Therefore, users of the service on Tencent Cloud are strongly recommended to use it. **Private network** Domain name, private network will not produce Traffic cost.
