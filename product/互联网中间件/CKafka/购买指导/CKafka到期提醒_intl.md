### Instance Isolation after Arrears

Instances services stop one day after accounts in arrears and renewal **SMS/email** will be sent to those accounts. Services will not be affected if you add funds within one day of arrears.

If you do not renew within one day after arrears, instances will be suspended and isolated. Billing of used Ckafka instances will also be stopped. Instance-related configurations will be kept for 7 days. Service will automatically resume if you add funds and pay the overdue amount within 7 dyas. If your arrears last over 7 days, you are deemed to have canceled CKafka service, and related configurations will be reclaimed.

Tencent Cloud will send an **SMS/email** reminder one day before reclaiming the isolated instance. Once instances are reclaimed, relevant configuration data will be permanently deleted and unrecoverable.
