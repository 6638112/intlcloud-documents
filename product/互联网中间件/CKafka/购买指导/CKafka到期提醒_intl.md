### Isolation after Arrears

Instances services stop one day after accounts in arrears and fund adding **SMS/email** will be sent to those accounts. Services will not be affected if you add funds within one day of arrears.

If you don't renew within one day after the arrears, the instances will be suspended and isolated. Then the Ckafka instances you are using will stop billing. Instance-related configurations will be retained for 7 days. If you top up to make up arrears during this period, your services will automatically resume. If you have arrears for more than 7 days, you shall be deemed to have abandoned the use of CKafka services, and relevant configuration data will also be reclaimed.

Tencent Cloud will send an **SMS/email** reminder one day before reclaiming the isolated instance. Once the instances are reclaimed, relevant configuration data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
