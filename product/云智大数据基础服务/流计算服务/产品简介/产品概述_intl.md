Tencent Cloud Stream Compute Service (SCS) is a cloud-based service that aggregates and computes streaming data. In just a few minutes, you can easily build stream computing applications such as website clickstream analysis, accurate ecommerce recommendation, real-time financial risk control, etc. The fully managed SCS can scale your computing resources up and down in real time, eliminating your need for the infrastructure OPS. In addition, SCS can easily access data sources in the cloud to provide you with complete support.

You can manage stream data input, write SQL analytical statements and configure the output of analysis results on the console. Depending on your configurations, computing resources are elastically scaled when your SCS analytical instances are running.

SCS is postpaid by hour, meaning that you only need to pay for the computing resources you consume. Currently, SCS is during promotion period and you can apply for a trial use and experience it for free once approved.
