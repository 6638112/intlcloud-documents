The homepage of the SCS console is used to manage instances. You can view the region of an instance, the current status of an instance and the list of instances, and work with instances, such as creating, starting and stopping an instance.

### 2. View the list
As shown on the homepage, you can see a list of all instances on the SCS console. From the region list on the top, you can select a region to display the instance list in this region. Each line of the item in the list shows the instance name, system-assigned serial number, current status, start time (last start time of the instance), run time (last run time of the instance) and operations that can be performed on the instance.
You can use the filter button on the list page to filter the instances with the same status.
