### Security
A secure network transfer protocol (TLS, DTLS) has been integrated into device access and data transfer, so that every device has its own certificate for authentication, effectively protecting against unauthorized access, data theft and tampering.

### Speed
With the aid of the SDK, console or Cloud API, device data communication can be quickly enabled without you having to worry about the details of the underlying communication protocols (such as MQTT protocol fields).

### Stability
Leveraging Tencent's years of experience in numerous services, IoT Hub's backend is capable of automatic disaster recovery and load balance, providing you with 24/7 OPS monitoring services.

### Extendibility
By opening up the link between device data and Tencent Cloud products based on the rule engine, the storage, real-time computation and intelligent processing and analytics of massive amounts of data can be achieved with speed and ease.

### Low Cost
- IoT Hub is billed based on the number of messages sent with low initial costs.
- Its one-stop service architecture reduces labor and time costs for R&D.
