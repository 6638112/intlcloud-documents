In order to better demonstrate the functions of IoT Hub, we have created a simple demo for smart home.
Application scenarios include:
- Scenario 1: The door is connected with the air conditioner, and actions of entering/leaving the house are monitored through the door to instruct the air conditioner to turn on/off.
- Scenario 2: It is described how the user can set the air conditioner temperature and query the energy consumption of the air conditioner using an app.

The demo involves the following features of IoT Hub:
- Message publishing and subscribing
- Device shadow-based status reporting and configuration sending
- Rule engine-based device message communication

You can refer to the demo for customization based on your own needs:
