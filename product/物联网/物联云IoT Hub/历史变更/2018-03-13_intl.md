### Data Forward to CKafka 
The rule engine allows you to configure rules to forward the eligible device-reported data to the Ckafka message queuing service, and then your application server can read the data from Ckafka for processing. This takes advantage of Ckafka's high throughput to create a highly available message linkage for you.
For details, see [Data Forward to Ckafka](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/634/14670).

### Firmware Upgrade
Device firmware upgrade, also known as OTA, is an important part of the IoT Hub service. When an IoT device has new features or vulnerabilities that need to be fixed, firmware upgrade can be quickly performed for the device through the OTA service.
