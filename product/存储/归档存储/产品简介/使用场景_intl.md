## Surveillance Videos
### Scenarios
- Surveillance videos of road traffic
- Surveillance videos for community security
- Surveillance videos at railway stations, airports, and customs
- Video recordings of liveness detection at banks
- Video recordings of household pets
- IoT platforms

### Description

Everyday, the video surveillance industry produces increasingly large amounts of video data. A long storage time for videos results in the accumulation of enormous amounts of data, which requires secure management. Video data streams can be automatically stored in CAS after pre-processing. Expired video data can be set to be automatically deleted depending on different situations and requirements, to reduce manual management costs and storage costs. Under special circumstances, you can quickly retrieve specific video data and use COS for monitoring and screening. Key surveillance footage can be reported to the public security system network.

## Scientific Experiments and Medical Data

### Scenarios
- Processed gene data
- Medical experimental data
- Medical videos and images
- Electronic medical records and health databases

### Description

Huge amounts of data are generated in scientific experiments and the medical field. The volume of data in gene sequencing has increased exponentially. In addition, large volumes of data are associated with electronic medical records, which include text, images, and videos. By comparatively analyzing large amounts of original data, you can discover useful information that provides reference for disease diagnosis and treatment. As such, it is very important to accumulate and archive original data in the long term. You can use CAS to store large amounts of original data and processed data at an extremely low price and management cost. You can also restore specific amounts of data over specific time periods, and reproduce results.

## Databases and System Service Integrators
### Scenarios
- Database archives
- File system snapshots
- User logs
- User-archived mails
- PaaS service provider
- SaaS service provider

### Description
SaaS service providers enable the delivery and application of services via the Internet at a low cost, greatly reducing the cost to target a market. SaaS service providers can reduce storage costs using CAS. With a proprietary security module, data is stored after desensitization, releasing local storage and gaining an advantage amid the fierce competition.

## Extremely Cold Media Resources
### Scenarios
- Videos generated by UGC community users
- Historical films and TV programs on VOD platforms
- Archives of historical programs for satellite TV stations
- Unedited original sources for newspapers and magazines
- Historical images and videos of LVB Apps

### Description
Hot videos in the online media libraries of TV stations need to be degraded regularly based on time and data temperature. From high-frequency data to low-frequency data, and then to nearline data, expired media data that is no longer in use is removed to the CAS offline media library, releasing storage space and reducing storage costs. Large amounts of old video data, as historical materials, can be stored securely in CAS for years, even decades. Central, unified resource management and retrieval lower the maintenance costs of TV stations. When there is VOD demand, data can be restored in 1-5 minutes, improving use efficiency.

## Mobile Data of Mobile Phone Manufacturers
### Scenarios
- Deleted mobile phone network data
- Historical versions of application installation packages
- Historical versions of system patches

### Description
Internet mobile phone manufacturers need to archive historical data. Cold data used infrequently, such as historical versions of installer packages, deleted files on removable cloud disks, and historical patches for system upgrades can be stored offline in CAS.
