## Billing Cycle

CAS supports the postpaid billing method. Fees are charged on a monthly basis, based on the actual usage during a month. The bill for the current month is issued on the 3rd day of the next month.

## In Arrears and Out of Service

If your account is in arrears, CAS will be out of service after 24 hours. Your data will be kept for 180 days and will be destroyed thereafter if you do not pay the arrears within such time. To avoid interruptions to the service, handle arrears in a timely manner upon receipt of arrear notices.

> **Notes:**
- When your account balance is no less than 0 after renewal, the service is ready to use automatically.
- When your account is in arrears and CAS is out of service, you will continue to be charged for the storage space occupied till the data is destroyed.
- Data that has been destroyed is unrecoverable.
- Delete data on CAS that you no longer need timely to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
- You can use the "Account Balance Alarm" function in "Billing Center" to set an alarm for arrears.
