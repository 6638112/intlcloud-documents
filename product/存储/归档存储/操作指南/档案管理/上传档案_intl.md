After creating a vault, you can upload an archive to it. For more information on archives, see [Concepts](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/572/8727).

## 1. Enter the upload page
In the CAS console, click **Vault Management** to go to the vault management page. Click **Upload Archive** on the right of the vault and the archive upload page pops up.

## 2. Upload an archive
Click **Select Files** to select one or more local files to upload on the pop-up page. You can also drag and drop the files to the upload area. You can enter archive descriptions as needed or delete unneeded archives in the list of archives to upload, and then click **Upload**.

> **Note:**
> After the archives are uploaded successfully, click **Complete** in the upper right corner to view and copy the archive ID. CAS does not save the index of archives, so you need to record the archive ID for subsequent archive operations.
