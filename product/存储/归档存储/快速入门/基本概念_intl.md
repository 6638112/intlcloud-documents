This section explains the key concepts and terms that you must understand to use CAS efficiently.

### Region

The area where data is stored. The following regions are available:

- Chengdu - domain name: cas.ap-chengdu.myqcloud.com
- Beijing - domain name: cas.ap-beijing.myqcloud.com
- Guangzhou - domain name: cas.ap-guangzhou.myqcloud.com
- Shanghai - domain Name: cas.ap-shanghai.myqcloud.com

### APPID (UID)

The APPID, also known as the UID, is a unique user ID assigned to each developer when he or she accesses the CAS service. It is generated by the system automatically after the successful application for CAS. Get APPID from [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer)

### QCS

The uniform identifier that Tencent Cloud uses to describe all cloud resources. It is expressed in a six-segment string, and can also be used to identify a vault. Go to "Vault" -> "Basic Information" in the console to obtain the QCS of the vault. Example of a vault QCS: `qcs:id/0:cas:ap-chengdu:uid/1251781432:vaults/111`. Get QCS from [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cas/vault)

### Key - SecretId/SecretKey

The SecretId/SecretKey are the signature keys owned by the developer and is automatically generated by the system after CAS is activated. A user accesses all the resources under the APPID with the same pair of SecretId/SecretKey. Get the keys from [here](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/capi)

### Vault

#### Concept
The container used to store data elements. Each data element is stored in a vault. You can use a vault for batch management of data. A maximum of 1000 vaults can be created under an account.

#### Supported operations
You can create, delete, query, call back, and lock vaults, or add archives to them.

### Archive

#### Concept
The basic entities stored in CAS. An archive consists of data and metadata. You can directly perform operations on a single archive. There is no limit on the number of archives in a vault. The size of each vault is limited to 40 TB.

#### Supported operations

You can upload, delete, and query archives.

### Job
#### Concept
A job instance is used to obtain offline files. You can obtain the data stored in CAS by initiating download jobs. After the jobs are initiated, you can query the job description and job list. A file is retained in the output for 24 hours. You can download the data output of the job within 24 hours after the job is completed.

#### Supported operations
In CAS, you can initialize, list, and describe jobs, and download files.

#### How to initiate a job to obtain offline data
The process to initiate a job to obtain offline data is as follows:

### Output
Outputs are located between the archives stored in CAS and users, and provide temporary storage for archive data. When the data retrieval and query job is completed, the data is temporarily stored in the output for 24 hours. After 24 hours, the data will become invalid.

### Retrieval

A user retrieves archives from CAS to the output. Three modes are available based on access time and cost: expedited mode, standard mode, and bulk mode.

- **Expedited mode**: This mode takes the shortest amount of time (1 to 5 minutes) to retrieve archive data. Files smaller than 256 MB are supported. When you need to access archives quickly in an emergency, using this mode can greatly save time and improve efficiency.
- **Standard mode**: In this mode, archive data can generally be retrieved within 3 to 5 hours.
-  **Bulk mode**: It is the lowest-cost mode. This mode can be used to obtain large amounts of archive data at a very low cost if you are not in urgent need of the data. Generally, it takes 5 to 12 hours to retrieve the archive data.
