Users of COS Standard service now receive a free storage quota perk. See below for details: 

| User Type | Free Quota          | Validity Period |
| -------- | :---------------- | ------ |
| Personal User | 50GB per month in standard storage class | 6 months  |
| Enterprise User | 1TB per month in standard storage class  | 6 months  |

> **Note:**
>
> 1. The cost is billed in the order of **Free quota > Storage pack > Pay-as-you-go**
>    - The default billing mode is Pay-as-you-go. Users' free quota will be deducted first, then any exceeding usage will be billed on a **Pay-as-you-go** basis.
>    - For users that purchased storage packs, their free quota will be deducted first, then the paid storage packs. The remaining usage will be billed on a **Pay-as-you-go** basis. 
>
> 2. The free quota is issued in the form of a free storage pack. After a user creates the first bucket, the free storage pack will automatically be issued to the user's account. The user can view the activation and expiration date of the free quota storage pack on the **Storage Pack Management** page in the COS Console.
>
> 3. **Validity of free quota** is 6 months from the month (not the exact date) the user creates the first bucket.
>
>    > For example, if a user creates the first bucket on 2019-02-10 17:13:14, then the validity of free quota is from 2019-02-01 00:00:00 to 2019-07-31 23:59:59.
>
> 4. If a user already receives a discount, the cost is calculated based on the discount price and he would not be eligible for the free quota perk.
>
> 5. If the service is stopped due to arrears or prohibited operations, the user will not be able to receive the free quota perk. Only when the service is reopened can the user continue to receive this perk.
