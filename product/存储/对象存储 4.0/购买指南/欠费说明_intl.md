## Arrears and Service Termination

When your account is in arrears for 24 hours, COS service will stop automatically. Your data will be stored for 120 days. If your account balance is not greater than 0 after 120 days, the data will be destroyed. 

If you receive an arrears notification, please go to the [Top-up Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/recharge) on the console and top up your account in time to prevent your business from being affected.

For billing details, please check the [Resource Statement](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/resources) page on the console. 

If you have any question on the billing items, see [COS Billing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6239) for the description for each billing item and the billing rules.

You can set an alarm for arrears using the **Account Balance Alarm** function in **Billing Center**. For more information, see [Billing overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555).

>!
> 1. When your account is in arrears and COS is out of service, **you will continue to be charged for the storage capacity occupied** till the data is destroyed.
> 2. The data cannot be recovered once destroyed.
> 3. After you topped up your account and the balance greater than 0, the service will  automatically restart.
> 4. Delete data on COS that you no longer need to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
