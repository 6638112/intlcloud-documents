## Past Due Payment and Service Suspension

If the account payment is past due for more than 24 hours, COS will be out of service. Your data will be stored for 120 days and will be destroyed thereafter if you do not pay the due and have a positive balance within such time.

If you receive an arrears notification, please go to the [Top-up Center](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/recharge) on the console and top up your account timely to prevent your business from being affected.

For any questions on bill details, you can check it on [Resource Statement](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/account/resources) page on the console. For information on how to perform the operations, see [Check bill details](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/30357) document.

If you have any question on the billing items, see [COS Billing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871) for the description for each billing item and the billing rules.

You can set an alarm for arrears using the **Account Balance Alarm** function in **Billing Center**. For more information, see [Account Balance Alarm Instruction](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9942).

>!
> 1. When your account is in arrears and COS is out of service, **you will continue to be charged for the storage capacity occupied** till the data is destroyed.
> 2. The data cannot be recovered once destroyed.
> 3. When your account balance is no less than 0 after renewal, the service is ready to be used automatically.
> 4. Delete data on COS that you no longer need timely to avoid incurring unnecessary charges.
