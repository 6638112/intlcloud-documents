After a tape gateway is created, you need to allocate the cloud storage space for the gateway to store user-uploaded data.
On the "Gateway" or "Tape" page in the CSG Console, click **Create a tape**. Enter corresponding information in the pop-up.

* Region: Select the region where the gateway is located.
* Gateway: Select the gateway to which you want to add the tape.
* Barcode: To ensure the uniqueness of the virtual tape, you can enter four uppercase letters or digits as a prefix (optional) in this field. The last six characters of the barcode are automatically generated by the system.
* Capacity: Set the capacity of the tape. It can be a positive integer between 10 GB and 4 TB.

After clicking "Create", the virtual tape enters "creating" state, and after the state becomes "normal", normal data writing can be started.
