## 1. Easy to Host and Deploy
Tencent Cloud allows you to enable a PostgreSQL instance and connect it to your applications within minutes without further configuration. It is configured with common parameters by default which can be modified in real time in the console. This helps you eliminate the hassle of complicated installation and configuration tasks and improve your OPS efficiency.

## 2. Easy Monitoring
Tencent Cloud provides key operation metrics for PostgreSQL, including CPU utilization, storage utilization, I/O activity, and other performance monitoring data. You can view them in the console free of charge to quickly locate and solve problems. You can customize alarm thresholds for these metrics, which keeps you updated on any exceptions by email or SMS, without you having to monitor them all the time.

## 3. Superior Performance
With NVMe SSD, TencentDB for PostgreSQL provides QPS at least 10 times higher than SATA disks. TencentDB for PostgreSQL uses one-primary-one-secondary architecture for deployment by default. Synchronous replication is enabled by default, protecting your business from being interrupted and preventing problems such as data corruption and data loss.

## 4. More Reliable
After a node failure, the recovery of the node will be immediately retried by cluster scheduling. When there is a serious problem with your data, you can quickly recover the node to a point in time to deal with upgrade failures, disaster recovery, etc. You can also perform automatic data recovery through the backup feature provided by the console. For more information, please see [Information Security > TencentDB for PostgreSQL service security > Backup and recovery](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/409/7565). By default, TencentDB comes with multiple security protections for each database.


## 5. Scalable
You can upgrade your instance to a desired specification with just one click in Tencent Cloud's console without extra operations. The upgraded instance inherits the IPs and all the configurations from the original instance, and there is only a 1-second disconnection during the upgrade process instead of long downtime, to meet your business needs at any time in a flexible way. When the existing PostgreSQL cannot support your business development, you can support massive customer again with only a few changes or even no changes to your business, without capacity limitation and performance bottleneck.
