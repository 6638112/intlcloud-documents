## Data Migration
**Note:**
**1. Before migration, please ensure that the version of the source instance is the same as that of the SQL Server of the destination instance.**
**2. For the bak files used for migration, please ensure that each bak file contains only one database.**
**3. The name of the migrated database cannot be the same as that of the TencentDB for SQL Server instance.**

To improve the efficiency of migration, it is recommended to use offline migration + online hot migration when migrating high volumes of data of a business on a live network.
Offline migration can quickly and securely migrate 99% of the data to Tencent Cloud's private network. In addition, for security reasons, it is not recommended to directly expose TencentDB instances to a public network (even a public IP is enabled, there will be a speed limit), so it is also necessary to adopt offline migration + online hot migration.
### Preparations for Migration
1. Create a database account and grant it the "read-write" permission;

2. Prepare the data backup file that needs to be offline migrated to Tencent Cloud;

### Migration Steps
1. Migrate the prepared data backup file [using COS to SQL Server](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/238/19103);

2. In the navigation bar on the left of the database instance page, select "SQL Server > Data Transfer > Create Task";

3. Create an offline migration task. The task name is user-defined. For source instance type, select "SQL Server backup and restoration". For source database region, select the region specified when uploading the backup file using the "Windows Client Upload Tool" (usually the same as the region of the destination database). The destination database type and region are automatically generated by the system according to the configuration of the source database. Finally, select the instance to migrate to in the instance ID drop-down list;

4. After the task is created, the page jumps to the task list where you can select a task and start it;

5. During the migration, after the synchronization is completed, you need to manually initiate the **Complete** operation to end the synchronization process, and the migration succeeds.

6. Check the synchronization state. After the state changes to "Synchronization succeeded", the entire offline migration process ends and the data migration succeeds. If the state changes to "Synchronization failed", please check the failure information and fix it accordingly and then re-migrate.
