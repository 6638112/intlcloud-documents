## License Included
Tencent Cloud can provide TencentDB instances with **license included**. The price of a "license included" model includes a SQL Server software license, underlying hardware resources and TencentDB management functions, so you don't need to purchase a Microsoft SQL Server license separately.

Using a "license included" database, you only need to pay for instance specifications and usage duration, without having to concern over hardware and licensing costs. In this way, high fixed costs are transformed into low variable costs, helping reduce your IT costs.

**Note:**
- Purchasing TencentDB for SQL Server does not mean that you have signed a long-term license contract for Microsoft SQL Server; therefore, you should not use the license of TencentDB in unauthorized locations or periods. For more information, see [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Provider Use Rights](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/userights/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=2).
- The basic price of TencentDB for SQL Server **does not include** original Microsoft or Tencent Cloud services.
