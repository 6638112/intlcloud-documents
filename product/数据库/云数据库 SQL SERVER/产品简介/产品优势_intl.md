## High Discounts for Lower Cloudification Costs
For your purchased TencentDB for SQL Server instances, Tencent Cloud has paid the product license fees to Microsoft, so you don't need to invest a large amount of money to purchase licenses separately, minimizing your business costs. Tencent Cloud offers a 70% discount for purchases of more than three years, further reducing your cloudification costs.

## Out-of-the-box Usage and On-demand Upgrade
You can customize the specifications of TencentDB for SQL Server at Tencent Cloud's official website. After placing the order, TencentDB for SQL Server can generate the target instances in real time, eliminating the trouble of self-building SQL Server clusters and saving time and effort. In the initial stage of your business, you can purchase lower specifications to cope with business pressure. As database pressure increases and data volume changes, you have the flexibility to adjust instance specifications, and during the upgrade process, the data link service will not be interrupted.
