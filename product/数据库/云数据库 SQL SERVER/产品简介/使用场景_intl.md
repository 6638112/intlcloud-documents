## 1. Cloud-based Business System
When building a business system directly in the cloud, TencentDB for SQL Server can be used as the basic database, which not only provides a stable and high-performance database support solution, but also effectively improves the performance of the business system.

## 2. Remote (Cloud) Data Disaster Recovery
Nowadays, electronic data has become the core assets of enterprises, and the loss of business data caused by force majeure and man-made accidents will bring irreparable losses to enterprises. However, remote disaster recovery achieved by self-building a remote IDC has a very low ROI. Therefore, it can be a good choice to use TencentDB as a remote database for disaster recovery.
With the aid of networks such as Direct Connect and VPN and database synchronization tools, enterprises can sync the data in databases in self-built data centers or databases offered by other cloud vendors to TencentDB for SQL Server in real time. Even if the data in the self-built data centers is completely lost, the data is still securely stored in TencentDB.

## 3. Mobile Office
TencentDB for SQL Sever supports quick deployment of your mobile office platforms such as OA, ERP and sales management, where the data is stored in Tencent Cloud's secure subnets and the database is protected by multiple measures for security and reliability.

## 4. Data Warehouse and Data Analytics Platform
TencentDB for SQL Sever helps you create a cloud-based data warehouse and data analytics platform with SQL Server's built-in business intelligence, IT dashboards and collaboration with SharePoint.

## 5. Business Elasticity
During business promotion and large-scale campaigns, business peaks can be extremely high, and self-built data centers generally are not optimized for peaks due to cost considerations. Thanks to the elastic scalability of the cloud, an elastic IDC can be built in the cloud data center, which can be scaled at any time for business needs and improve business elasticity together with CVM and TencentDB for SQL Server.
