In the TencentDB for SQL Server console, you can view the list of backup files and download them through a private or public network. Then, you can restore the database to another instance (such as a self-built instance) using a downloaded backup file.
The specific operation method is as follows:
1.	Enter the backup management page of instance management where you can see the list of backup files; then, click Download to enter the download page.
