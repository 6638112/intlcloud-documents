As a universal database, TencentDB for MongoDB, with great stability, performance and scalability, can satisfy most of the "no schema" scenarios. Typical application scenarios are as follows:

## Game Industry
MongoDB is especially suitable for game backend databases and can meet the fast-changing requirements of the game industry. MongoDB stores players' information, equipment, and credits in built-in documents to ensure convenient query and update. The "no schema" mode saves you the effort to change table structures and significantly shortens the version iteration cycle.
MongoDB can also be used as a cache server to logically allocate hot data. It is comparable to other common cache servers in terms of performance while providing more query methods.

## Mobile Industry
TencentDB for MongoDB supports two-dimensional spatial indexing, which makes it easy to query geo-location relationships and retrieve user geographic location data, thus achieving the implementation of geo-based map applications and such features as People/Places Nearby. MongoDB can also be used to store user information, as well as WeChat Moments and other information published by users.

## IoT Industry
Terminal devices in the field of IoT (Internet of Things), such as medical equipment and transport vehicle GPS, can easily and continuously generate TBs of data. MongoDB can be used to store information of all the connected intelligent equipment, as well as log information reported by the equipment, and carry out multi-dimensional analysis on the information. You can build a distributed TencentDB for MongoDB sharding cluster to achieve storage without capacity limit and expand capacity online so as to easily process massive IoT data.

## Logistics Industry
While the order status is continuously updated during delivery, TencentDB for MongoDB can store the order status in the embedded JSON format so that all order changes can be read in one query.

## LVB Industry
The LVB industry generates a large amount of gift information, user chat information, etc. TencentDB for MongoDB can be used to store user information, gift information, logs and so on. It also provides rich aggregate queries for business analysis.
