>?
- Cloud products in the same region communicate with each other over a private network, but the private networks for the resources under different accounts are completely isolated from each other.
- Cloud products in different regions cannot communicate with each other over a private network.
- Tencent Cloud resources in different regions cannot access each other over a private network.
- Select a region closest to you when purchasing cloud services to minimize the access latency.

## Availability Zone
Availability zones are Tencent Cloud's physical IDCs with power facilities and networks independent of each other within the same region. They are designed to ensure that failures within an availability zone can be isolated (except for large-scale disaster or major power failure) without spreading to other zones, so as to ensure your business stability. Availability zones in the same region communicate with each other over a private network, and network latency is shorter for products within the same availability zone.
