## Billing Method ##
TencentDB for MongoDB supports monthly subscription and pay as you go billing methods.
- Monthly subscription is a prepaid billing method. It is applicable to long-cycle business with stable volume, and is more economical than the pay-as-you-go method. For more information, see [Prepaid Billing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9618).
- Pay as you go is a postpaid billing method, and is applicable to scenarios where the business volume fluctuates dramatically at a certain time. You only pay for what you actually use with no upfront payment required. For more information, see [Pay As You Go Billing](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/555/9617).
