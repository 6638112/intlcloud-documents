Depending on your business needs, you can manually terminate pay-as-you-go and monthly subscription instances.

- Pay-as-you-go instances are instances that you request on demand, and they are charged based on the actual usage duration. If you need to return a pay-as-you-go instance, you can terminate it, and then it will no longer generate any cost.
- Monthly subscription instances are instances that you need to make payment in advance. If you are unsatisfied with the monthly subscription database you have purchased, you can apply for an unconditional return and refund.

>?If you want to terminate a monthly subscription instance but find the **Return Now** button unavailable, it means that the self-service return quota under the account has run out, and the monthly subscription instance cannot be manually terminated but will be automatically terminated after expiration.

The refund procedure is as follows:
-  **Refund procedure for monthly subscription instances**
