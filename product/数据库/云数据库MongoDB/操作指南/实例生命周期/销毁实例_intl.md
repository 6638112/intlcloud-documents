- For prepaid monthly/yearly subscription instances, you prepay for capacity. You can cancel your subscriptions at any time and get a refund if you are not satisfied with the product.

>?If you find **Return Now** button unavailable when you try to terminate prepaid monthly/yearly subscription instance, it means the self-service return quota of your account has run out and you cannot manually terminate the instance.
