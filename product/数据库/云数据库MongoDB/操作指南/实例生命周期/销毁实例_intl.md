You can manually terminate pay-as-you-go and prepaid (monthly/yearly subscription) instances to meet your business requirements.

- Using pay-as-you-go instances, you apply for the capacity on demand, and you only pay for what you use. You can terminate the instance when you no longer need it, and no additional fees will be applied to this instance.

- Using prepaid (monthly/yearly subscription) instances, you pay for the capacity in advance. If you are unsatisfied with the product, you can cancel your subscriptions at any time, and we will issue your refund.

>?If you see that the **Return Now** button is unavailable when you try to terminate your prepaid (monthly/yearly subscription) instance, it means that the self-service return quota of your account has run out. That is, you cannot manually terminate the instance. Instead, the instance will be revoked automatically after the subscription ends.


The following shows how to get the refunds:
