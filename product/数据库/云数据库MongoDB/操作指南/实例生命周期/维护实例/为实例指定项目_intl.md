TencentDB for MongoDB allows you to assign instances to different projects for management.

Notes:
- Assigning and moving database instances among projects does not affect the external services they provide.
- You need to specify projects to which the new instances belong when purchasing them. The default project is **Default Project**.
- You can use the **Assign to Project** feature to re-assign instances to other projects.
