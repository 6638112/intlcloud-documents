Maintenance period is a very important concept for TencentDB for MongoDB. To ensure the stability of your TencentDB for MongoDB instance, the backend system performs maintenance operations on the instance during the maintenance period from time to time. It is highly recommended that you set an acceptable maintenance period for your business instance, usually during off-peak hours, so as to minimize the impact on your business.
