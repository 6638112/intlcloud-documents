Go to Tencent Cloud's **Console** page, and click **Billing Center** and **Bills** at the upper right corner to enter the **Bills** page.

# How do the bills illustrate your spending？

The bills will record the following:

The resources that are charged on a monthly basis used in the previous month.
The resources that are charged on a daily basis used from the last day of the previous month to the second last day of this month.
The resources that are charged on an hourly basis used from the last hour of the previous month to the second last hour of this month.
The above time may be inaccurate when the post-paid resources have a delayed settlement.
