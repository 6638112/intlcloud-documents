# What is prepay account balance?
Your prepay account balance reflects your remaining cash balance and remaining free credits. The service automatically charges the prepay account balance at the end of a billing cycle. The billing cycle varies by product and Tencent Cloud services are billed by the hour, by the day or by the month.

# What happens when the prepay account balance is negative?
When your prepay account balance is negative, it is very likely that your cloud services will be interrupted. Most of our hourly billed products will be stopped if your account remains negative for two hours consecutively. Therefore, to make sure you have a better experience with our products, we will automatically charge you using your designated credit card or PayPal account, if your prepay account balance is less than the service fee you spent. We will also automatically top up your prepay account once your prepay account balance is less than $1. Normally the top up amount will be no more than $30. For example, if you are owed $3 at the end of a billing cycle, we will charge you $3 and top up your prepay account balance to $30 automatically.

If your prepay account balance remains negative and we fail to charge you using credit card or PayPal, your cloud services will be interrupted. Please ensure that your credit card is valid to prevent this from happening.

If the top up amount is larger than the amount you currently owe, your next payment will be reduced. 

# How to top up the prepay account balance？

# How to withdraw？
You can submit a ticket for your cash account balance to be returned to your payment source. Please note that only your cash balance can be withdrawn. The withdrawn amount will return to your original payment source, which will be your PayPal account in most cases. It will normally take about 3-5 work days for the withdrawal process to complete.

Please note that only cash balance can be withdrawn, credit balance (free credits or service credits granted by Tencent Cloud) cannot be withdrawn.
