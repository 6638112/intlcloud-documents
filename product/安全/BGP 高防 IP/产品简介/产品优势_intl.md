## Powerful Attack Defense Network 
Connected with 30 ISPs across China and deployed over dozens of protection nodes overseas, Tencent Cloud's BGP linkage can provide the protection bandwidth up to 900 Gbps for a single customer(point) in China, and up to 400Gbps outside of China, thus helping defense against all kinds of DDoS attacks.
## Industry-leading Traffic Cleansing Capability
Powered by Tencent's self-developed protection cluster, Anti-DDoS Advance utilizes multi-dimensional algorithms such as IP profiling, behavior analysis, Cookie challenge, and continuously updates the protection algorithms through AI intelligent engine, thus being capable of accurately and quickly separating malicious network traffic from normal traffic, protecting your business against various layers of DDoS attacks.
## Fast Access
Tencent Cloud's BGP links to 30 ISPs in China, the great coverage thus allows users to quickly access the network with low latency.
## Hiding Customer's Real Server
Anti-DDoS Advanced can hide the IP of the real server. It uses an alternative IP with high defense ability to which attack traffic will be directed. This protects the real server from malicious traffic, thus mitigating the attacks.
## Wide Applicability
Anti-DDoS Advanced supports website and non-website applications, and the service is applicable to a wide variety of industries, including finance, e-commerce, game, and government.
## Flexible Billing and Optimized Cost 
Anti-DDoS Advanced bills your account for “Base Protection + Elastic Protection”- you can adjust elastic protection bandwidth as needed without adding devices or changing configurations when the attack traffic volume exceeds the base protection bandwidth so as to avoid service interruption. This flexible billing method reduces your cost and ensures you only pay for what you use.
## Granular Attack Defense Report
The report provides accurate, detailed real-time statistics and automated packet capturing that allows you to trace and analyze the attacks.
