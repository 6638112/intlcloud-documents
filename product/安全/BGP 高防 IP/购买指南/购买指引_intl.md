## Prerequisites

Before purchasing an Anti-DDoS Advanced instance, you need to register a Tencent cloud account and complete the identity verification.

## Steps
1. Log in to the [Anti-DDoS Advanced console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/dayu/bgpip), and click ***Create***.

2. Select the protection configuration according to the actual demand.
 - Region: Anti-DDoS Advanced uses the forwarding proxy method. Select a region close to the location of your real server to minimize access latency.
 - Base protection bandwidth: Prepaid by month or year. It is recommended to select a base protection bandwidth slightly higher than the average value of the historical attack traffic, so as to defend against most attacks.
 - Elastic protection bandwidth: Billed based on the actual protection bandwidth by day. It is recommended to select an elastic protection bandwidth slightly higher than the recorded largest attack traffic, so as to sufficiently defend against large traffic attacks and avoid IP block caused by traffic exceeding the protection bandwidth.
 - Forwarding traffic: The normal traffic forwarded to the real server without attacks. It is recommended to select a bandwidth according to normal traffic.
 - Quantity: Select the quantity of instances you want to purchase.
 - Usage period: Select the usage period you want to purchase. The fees to be prepaid are calculated based on the number of instances, the base protection bandwidth and the purchased usage period.
 - Auto renewal: Optional. If this is selected, the service packs will be automatically renewed by month upon expiration when your Tencent Cloud account has sufficient balance, so as to provide non-stop protection to your business.
