## Non-transitive connectivity of peering connections
A peering connection enables connectivity between two VPCs, but the connectivity cannot be transited.
For example, as shown in the following figure, peering connections are created between VPC 1 and VPC 2, and between VPC 1 and VPC 3. However, due to the non-transitivity of peering connections, traffic cannot flow between VPC 2 and VPC 3.

>**Note:**
>Even if a peering connection is created, both ends of the connection cannot communicate with each other if routes for sending and returning packets are not configured at both ends.

## Intra-region and cross-region peering connections
VPCs support both intra-region and cross-region peering connections. Due to differences in physical distance and underlying implementation architecture, there are some differences between the two types of connections, as shown in the following table:

| Comparison item | Intra-region peering connection | Cross-region peering connection |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Underlying architecture | Local private network within a single region based on Tencent Cloud | Cross-region internal MPLS network based on Tencent Cloud |
| Bandwidth | Maximum bandwidth for interconnection with public cloud: 5 Gbps<br/>Maximum bandwidth for interconnection with BM network: 1 Gbps | Maximum bandwidth: 1 Gbps, with the following options available for the bandwidth cap (MB/sec): <br/>10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 <br/>For peering connections between Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Korea, and Hong Kong (China), you can [apply for higher bandwidth](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category/create?level1_id=6&level2_id=168&level1_name=%E8%AE%A1%E7%AE%97%E4%B8%8E%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C&level2_name=%E7%A7%81%E6%9C%89%E7%BD%91%E7%BB%9C%20VPC).<br/>If you require data connectivity between Mainland China and other regions, consult your business manager. |
| Billing | Free of charge | Daily billing based on the regions where the two ends of the peering connection are located and the actual network bandwidth used. For more information, see [Price overview](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/3079). |
| Availability | Intra-region service quality level: gold; guaranteed availability: â‰¥ 99.50% | Linkage availability:<br/>Platinum: 99.95%<br/>Gold: 99.50%<br/>Silver: 99.00%<br/>For more information, see [SLA](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/215/17800). |
| Cross-account connection | Supported | Supported |
| Access permission | The CVMs at either end of a peering connection can access all the resources at the peer end, including CVMs, databases, and CLBs. | The CVMs at either end of a peering connection can access all the resources at the peer end, including CVMs, databases, and CLBs. |
| Function limits | The VPC IP ranges to which the two ends of a peering connection belong cannot overlap.<br/>Peering connections are independent of each other. | The VPC IP ranges to which the two ends of a peering connection belong cannot overlap.<br/>**If multiple peer VPCs are connected to the same VPC, the IP ranges to which these peer VPCs belong cannot overlap.** |
| Application scenario | Connect applications in different VPCs within the same region | Typical application scenario: **cross-region disaster recovery**<br/>VPCs in different regions can communicate with each other over cross-region peering connections, which helps rapidly deploy a 2-region-3-DC solution for disaster recovery and meet the requirement for financial-level network disaster recovery with high bandwidth and reliability. |

## Gateway bandwidth limit for peering connections
Gateway bandwidth limits for peering connections provide "monitoring" and "control" at the granularity of **IP-gateway**. Its fine-grained and visual gateway traffic enables network OPS personnel to get a clear picture of the traffic passing through the gateway. Its speed limit at the granularity of IP-gateway helps block exceptional traffic.
- **Example:**
- Early one day, the gateway traffic of a company surged. By using intelligent gateway bandwidth limit, OPS personnel traced the IPs that caused this traffic surge based on the time when the traffic surge occurred and quickly located the root cause. In addition, gateway bandwidth limit provides bandwidth control at the granularity of IP-gateway, which can restrict the bandwidth from an IP to the gateway and block exceptional traffic to protect key business.
- **Advantages of gateway bandwidth limit:**
 - Provides accurate gateway troubleshooting, which can minimize the network failure time. Real-time traffic query and TOP N ranking can be used to analyze source IPs and key metrics, helping quickly locate exceptional traffic.
 - Provides "monitoring" and "control" at the granularity of IP-gateway. Minute-level network traffic query can be used to identify exceptional traffic that maliciously occupies bandwidth in time. Bandwidth limits can be set at the granularity of IP-gateway to guarantee the stable operation of core business.
 - Provides full-time and full-traffic analysis for gateways, which can minimize cloud network costs. QoS can be used to limit the bandwidth of non-key business, which helps reduce the cost when the network budgets are limited.
