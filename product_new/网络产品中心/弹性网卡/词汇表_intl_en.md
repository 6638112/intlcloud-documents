### Virtual Private Cloud
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to build an independent network space on Tencent Cloud, and it is quite similar to a traditional network hosted in your IDC. However, those hosted in Tencent Cloud VPC are your service resources on Tencent Cloud, including <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/495" target="_blank">Cloud Virtual Machine</a>, <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/214/524" target="_blank">Cloud Load Balancer</a>, <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/236" target="_blank">TencentDB</a>. There is no need to consider the purchase and OPS of network devices, you only need to use softwares to customize IP range divisions, IP addresses, routing policies, etc. You can access the internet easily via the <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/1941" target="_blank">EIP</a>, <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4975" target="_blank">NAT gateway</a>, and <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4972" target="_blank">public gateway</a>, and connect the VPC with your IDC via <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4956" target="_blank">VPN</a> or <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4976" target="_blank">Direct Connect</a>. Also, the <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/5000" target="_blank">Peering Connection</a> of the Tencent Cloud VPC enables service sharing across the globe, as well as the 2-region-3-DC disaster recovery. In addition, the <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/500" target="_blank">security groups</a> and <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/5132" target="_blank">network ACLs</a> of VPC can meet your network security requirements in a multi-dimensional and all-round manner.
### Security Group
<a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/500" target="_blank">Security Group</a> is a virtual firewall with the state-based packet filtering feature, which is used to set network access control for one or more CVMs. You can add CVM instances with the same network security isolation requirements within the same region to the same security group, to filter the inbound and outbound traffic of the CVM through the network policies of the security group.
### Route Table
A <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4954" target="_blank">route table</a> consists of a series of routing policies that are used to define the traffic direction of each subnet within the VPC. A subnet can be associated with only one route table, but a route table can be associated with multiple subnets in the same VPC.
### Private IP
A private IP is an IP address assigned to an instance in the Tencent Cloud VPC or the basic network, which cannot be used to access Internet but can be used for communications between instances in the VPC or the basic network. 
### EIP
An <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/213/1941" target="_blank">elastic IP (EIP)</a> is a public IP address that can be applied for independently. It supports dynamic binding and unbinding. You can bind an EIP to or unbind it from a CVM (or NAT gateway instance) in the account. Here are the main functions:</br>1. To retain an IP. ICP domain name filing is required for the mapping between IPs and DNS in China.</br>2. To shield off instance failures. For example, a DNS name is mapped to an IP address through dynamic DNS mapping. It may take up to 24 hours to propagate this mapping to the entire Internet, while elastic IP enables the drift of an IP from one CVM to another. In case of a CVM failure, all you need to do is start another instance and remap it, thus responding rapidly to the instance failure.
### Subnet
A <a href="https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/doc/product/215/4927" target="_blank">subnet</a> is a flexible division of VPC IP address ranges. You can deploy applications and services across different subnets to host multi layers of web applications safely and flexibly in the Tencent Cloud VPC.
