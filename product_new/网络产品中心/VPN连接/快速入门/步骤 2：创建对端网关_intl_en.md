Before creating a VPN tunnel, you need to create a customer gateway.
1. Log in to [VPC Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vpc/vpc?rid=1).
2. In the left sidebar, choose **VPN Connection** > **Customer Gateway** to go to the management page.
3. Choose a region, i.e. **Guangzhou** in this example, and click **New**.
4. Enter the name of the customer gateway (for example, TomVPNUserGw) and the public IP address (for example, `202.108.22.5`) of the VPN gateway of the IDC.
