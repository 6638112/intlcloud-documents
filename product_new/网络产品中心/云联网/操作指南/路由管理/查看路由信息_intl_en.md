>
>- If no IP range conflict occurs, the route table is **Valid** by default.
>- If the route conflicts with an existing route, the route table is **Invalid**. For more information about the conflict rules and restrictions, see [Use Limits - Routing Restrictions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1003/30052).
