## Operation Scenario
This document describes how to create a TcaplusDB application in the console.

## Prerequisites
You have [signed up for a Tencent Cloud account](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/9603) and [verified your identity successfully](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/378/3629).

## Directions

2. Configure your application in the application creation pop-up.

 - **Connection Protocol**: Select a connection protocol (data description protocol) for your TcaplusDB application.
 - **Application Name and Access Password**: An application name should be unique under the same account. An access password must contain lowercase letters (a-z), uppercase letters (A-Z), and digits (0-9).
