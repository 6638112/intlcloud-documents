## Daily Billing
If you are billed daily, MPS fees will be charged from your account. If your account falls into arrears due to insufficient balance, MPS will complete all ongoing transcoding tasks first and then enter the service suspension process. Only after you top up your account to a positive balance can you continue to use the console. The daily billing mode is used by default. If you want to change it to monthly billing, please contact your Tencent Cloud rep.

#### Service suspension mechanism
MPS will be suspended if your account falls into arrears.
+ Everyday at a point between 12:00 and 18:00 Beijing time, MPS will calculate, output, and settle the bill for fees incurred yesterday.
+ If payment fails due to insufficient balance, you will receive a notification for arrears via SMS on the same day. If you fail to top up your account to a positive balance in 24 hours, MPS will be officially suspended. If you top up your account in 24 hours, MPS will remain available.
+ After MPS is suspended, you cannot use the MPS services or console, but files and configuration information will be retained without being deleted or modified.
