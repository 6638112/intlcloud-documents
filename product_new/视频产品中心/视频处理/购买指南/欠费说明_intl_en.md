## Daily Billing
If you are on a daily billing cycle, MPS will deduct fees from your account balance. If your account has insufficient balance and becomes overdue, MPS will complete all ongoing transcoding tasks before suspending the service. You will only be able to continue using the service after you make the payment and your balance becomes positive. The daily billing mode is used by default. If you want to change to monthly billing, please contact your Tencent Cloud sales rep.
