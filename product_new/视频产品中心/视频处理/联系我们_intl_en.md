## Ticket System
If you encounter any OPS or technical problems when using the product, you can log in to the Tencent Cloud Console and follow on-screen prompts to submit a ticket. We will get back to you as soon as possible.
Ticket links:
- Submitting a ticket: [Submit a ticket](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder/category)
- Querying ticket status: [Ticket list](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/workorder)

A ticket can have the following statuses:

- Pending processing: The ticket is just submitted or has been received but not reviewed by the technical support team. You can submit additional information or close the ticket at this stage.
- Processing: The technical support team has received and reviewed the ticket and is taking an action. You can submit additional information or close the ticket at this stage.
- More information required: The technical support team has received and reviewed the ticket, but more information is required for further processing. You can close the ticket at this stage.
  
  > If you submit the ticket again after providing more information, it will enter the "pending processing" status.
- Closed: The ticket is solved or closed by you before the technical support team takes an action.
