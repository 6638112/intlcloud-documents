### Operation Scenarios
After you activate VOD, the system will assign you a default domain name `xxx.vod2.myqcloud.com`, which will be used by default for all VOD resources. You can also add and resolve a custom domain name in the [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview).
## Prerequisites
- You have activated VOD.
- The domain name to be added has successfully obtained an ICP filing. For more information, please see [ICP Filing Application Process](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1022/31659).

## Adding a Domain Name
1. Log in to the [VOD Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/vod/overview) and click **Distribution and Playback** > **Domain Names** on the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add Domain**. In the pop-up dialog box, enter the domain name that has successfully obtained an [ICP filing](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1022/31659) and click **OK**.

>- It takes several minutes to add the domain name. After the domain name is added, you can view its status, CNAME, and domain name type.
>- Up to 18 domain names can be added to a Tencent Cloud account.


## Resolving a Domain Name
After adding a domain name, you need to configure the CNAME in the specific DNS service provider of the domain name, so that users can access your video information through the domain name.
