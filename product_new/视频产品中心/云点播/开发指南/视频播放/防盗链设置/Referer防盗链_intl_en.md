## Feature Overview
- Based on the referer mechanism supported by the HTTP protocol, the source of a request can be identified through the referer field in the HTTP header. You can configure a referer blocklist or allowlist to identify and authenticate the sources of video requests.
- Blocklist and allowlist modes are supported. When a video playback request reaches a CDN node, the node will authenticate the request source according to the configured referrer blocklist or allowlist. If a request meets the rule, CDN will return video data; otherwise, it will return a 403 response code and reject the playback request.

## Precautions
* This feature is optional and not enabled by default.
* After enabling this feature, select and configure the blocklist or allowlist. The two modes are mutually exclusive, and only one is supported at the same time.
* 1â€“10 domain names can be entered in the blocklist or allowlist (one entry per line).
* Do not put a protocol name (`http://` or `https://`) before a domain name. Domain name matching is based on the prefix (for example, if you enter `abc.com`, then both `abc.com/123` and `abc.com.cn` will be matched), and wildcard (e.g., `*.abc.com)` is supported.
