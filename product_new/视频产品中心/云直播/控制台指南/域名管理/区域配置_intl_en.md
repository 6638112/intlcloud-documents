## Scenario
If your playback domain name needs overseas content delivery, acceleration, and playback, you need to switch to an overseas region by selecting one in the region configuration.

## Prerequisites
You have logged in to the [LVB Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/live).
## Steps
1. When adding a domain name or selecting a playback domain name, select an accelerated region for live streaming content delivery from "Mainland China", "Outside Mainland China", and "Global Acceleration" and click **Submit**.

3. In the **Advanced Configuration** tab, you can set and modify the region configuration for the playback domain name. Click **Edit** in **Region Configuration** to switch among "Mainland China", "Global Acceleration", and "Outside Mainland China".
>!
>- The playback address cannot be used properly in a non-accelerated region.
>- If the accelerated region covers Mainland China, you need to apply for an ICP filing for the playback domain name first.
