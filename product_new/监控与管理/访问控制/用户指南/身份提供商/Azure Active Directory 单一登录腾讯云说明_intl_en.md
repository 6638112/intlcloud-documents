## Introduction
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service released by Microsoft. It can be used to help employees manage internal and external resources. Tencent Cloud supports identity federation with SAML 2.0 (Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0). SAML 2.0 is an open standard used by many identity providers (IdPs). You can use the SAML 2.0-based identity federation to integrate Azure Active Directory with Tencent Cloud, implementing single sign-on through the Azure AD account to log in to the Tencent Cloud console and manage Tencent Cloud resources without requiring the creation of a CAM sub-user for each employee of the enterprise or organization.

## Directions

|RoleSessionName| https://cloud.tencent.com/SAML/Attributes | Attribute| Azure |

> Replace {AccountID}, {RoleName}, and {ProviderName} of the **Role** source attribute with the following content:
>- {AccountID}: Replace this with your Tencent Cloud account ID. You can view this at [Account Information - Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/developer).
>- {RoleName}: Replace this with the role name you have created in Tencent Cloud for the identity provider. For more information, see [Creating a Role](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/598/19381). Role names can be viewed in [Role - Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/role). If you need to add more, you can add them in this format: qcs::cam::uin/{AccountID}:roleName/{RoleName}. Separate them using semicolons (;).
>- {ProviderName}: Replace this with the SAML identity provider name that you created on Tencent Cloud. You can view this at [Identity Providers - Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cam/idp).
