## Client Errors
| Error Code Name | Error Code Value | Description | Cause | Suggested Solution |
|--------|----|-------|--------------------|-------------------|
| AV_ERR_REPEATED_OPERATION | 1001 | Repeated operation | An operation is performed when the same operation is in progress. Operation types include `AVContext`, room, device, and member. `AVContext` operations: `StartContext/StopContext`. Room operations: `EnterRoom/ExitRoom`. Device operations: enabling/disabling a device. | Perform the next operation after the ongoing operation is completed. |
| AV_ERR_EXCLUSIVE_OPERATION | 1002 | Exclusive operation | An operation is performed when another operation of the same type is in progress. | Perform the next operation after the ongoing operation is completed. |
| AV_ERR_HAS_IN_THE_STATE | 1003 | Repeated operation | An operation is performed to make an object enter a state when the object is already in this state; for example, when the client is already in a room, it performs an operation to enter the room again. | Regard the current operation as successful since the object is already in the desired state. |
| AV_ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT | 1004 | Invalid parameter | One or more incorrect parameters are passed in when an SDK API is called; for example, when the client is trying to enter a room, the input room type is not `AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_PAIR` or `AVRoom::ROOM_TYPE_MULTI`. | Read the relevant API document carefully to get the valid value range for each parameter of each API, and take preventive measures to ensure the correctness of input parameters. |
| AV_ERR_TIMEOUT | 1005 | Timeout | The result of an operation was not returned within the specified time. This error occurs mostly when a signal is transmitted but the network is exceptional; for example, after the client performs an operation to enter a room, the result of the operation is not returned within 30 seconds. 	| Check whether the network is normal and whether the internet can be accessed, and then try again. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED | 1006 | Not implemented | The relevant feature has not been implemented when an SDK API is called. | Find other alternative methods. |
| AV_ERR_NOT_IN_MAIN_THREAD | 1007 | Not in the main thread | SDK APIs must be called in the main thread, but the client did not call the SDK API in the main thread. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called in the main thread. |
| AV_ERR_RESOURCE_IS_OCCUPIED | 1008 | Occupied resource | A required resource, such as the camera or screen, is being used. | Identify the specific resource to be used and confirm the reason why it is being used to ensure that SDK features are used at the right time without resource conflict. |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_EXIST | 1101 | Invalid `AVContext` status | When an `AVContext` object is not in the `CONTEXT_STATE_STARTED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVContext` object is in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_CONTEXT_NOT_STOPPED | 1102 | Invalid `AVContext` status | When an `AVContext` object is not in the `CONTEXT_STATE_STOPPED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVContext` object is in this status; for example, the client calls `AVContext::DestroyContext` when the `AVContext` object is not in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXIST | 1201 | Invalid `AVRoom` status | When an `AVRoom` object is not in the `ROOM_STATE_ENTERED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVRoom` object is in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ROOM_NOT_EXITED | 1202 | Invalid `AVRoom` status | When an `AVRoom` object is not in the `ROOM_STATE_EXITED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVRoom` object is in this status; for example, the client calls `AVContext::StopContext` when the `AVRoom` object is not in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_NOT_EXIST | 1301 | The device does not exist | The client uses a device that does not exist or has not been initialized. | Verify that the device exists, make sure that the device ID is entered correctly, and use the device only after it is successfully initialized. |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_NOT_EXIST | 1401 | The `AVEndpoint` object does not exist | Before a member sent an audio or video file, the client tried to get the `AVEndpoint` object of the member. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_ENDPOINT_HAS_NOT_VIDEO | 1402 | A member does not initiate a video chat | Before a member initiated a video chat, the client tried to perform an operation that can be completed only after a video chat is initiated; for example, before the member initiates a video chat, the client requests the video image of the member. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_TINYID_TO_OPENID_FAILED | 1501 | Failed to convert a `tinyid` into an identifier. | After receiving the signal indicating a member's information update, the client needs to convert the relevant `tinyid` into an identifier; however, the conversion failed because the relevant logic of the IMSDK library or the network was exceptional. | Check whether the network is normal and check logs to confirm whether the relevant logic of the IMSDK library is normal. |
| AV_ERR_OPENID_TO_TINYID_FAILED | 1502 | Failed to convert an identifier into a `tinyid`. | When calling the `StartContext` API, the client needs to convert the relevant identifier into a `tinyid`; however, the conversion failed because the relevant logic of the IMSDK library or the network was exceptional, or the client has not logged in. | Check whether the network is normal, check logs to confirm whether the relevant logic of the IMSDK library is normal, and verify that the IMSDK login API has been successfully called. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_EXIST | 1601 | Invalid `AVDeviceTest` status | When an `AVDeviceTest` object is not in the `DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STARTED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVDeviceTest` object is in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_DEVICE_TEST_NOT_STOPPED 	| 1602 | Invalid `AVDeviceTest` status | When an `AVDeviceTest` object is not in the `DEVICE_TEST_STATE_STOPPED` status, the client calls an API that can be called only when the `AVDeviceTest` object is in this status; for example, the client calls `AVContext::StopContext` when the `AVDeviceTest` object is not in this status. | Modify the business logic to ensure that SDK APIs are called at the right time. |
| AV_ERR_INVITE_FAILED | 1801 | Failed to send an invitation | A failure occurred while sending an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally; therefore, this error code can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_ACCEPT_FAILED | 1802 | Failed to accept an invitation | A failure occurred while accepting an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally; therefore, this error code can be ignored. |
| AV_ERR_REFUSE_FAILED | 1803 | Failed to decline an invitation | A failure occurred while declining an invitation. | The invitation module is used only for demonstration, and the invitation feature is not supported externally; therefore, this error code can be ignored. |
| QAV_ERR_NOT_TRY_NEW_ROOM | 2001 | The client failed to enter a new room and stayed in the original room. | The client failed to switch to a new room and stayed in the current room. | Stay in the current room for normal use. |
| QAV_ERR_TRY_NEW_ROOM_FAILED | 2002 | The client tried to enter a new room but failed and then exited the original room. | The client failed to switch to a new room and then exited the original room. | Enter the room again. |

| AV_ERR_SERVER_NO_PERMISSION | 10003 | No permission | The client had no permission to use a feature; for example, the client carries an incorrect or expired signature when it tries to enter a room. | Be sure to use a feature after the permission parameters are correctly set. Check whether the `AppID` and permission key are correct. |
