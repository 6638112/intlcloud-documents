## Configuration Scenario
Tencent Cloud CDN does not cache 301/302 status codes by default. When an origin server returns a 301/302 request, the CDN node will return the response to the client by default, and the client will be redirected to the corresponding resource for access.

When follow 301/302 redirect configuration is enabled, the CDN node will redirect to the specified address when receiving a 301/302 redirect request during origin-pull until it gets the required resource (through up to 3 follows) and then return the actual resource to the client. Thus, the client does not need to be redirected.

## Configuration Guide
### Viewing the configuration
Log in to the [CDN Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/cdn), select **Domain Management** on the left sidebar, and click **Manage** to the right of the domain name to enter its configuration page. You will find the **Follow 301/302 Configuration** section in the **Origin Configuration** tab. It is disabled by default.

>If your acceleration domain name is configured for global acceleration, the follow 301/302 redirect configuration will take effect globally. This configuration does not distinguish between requests from Mainland China and from outside Mainland China.

## Configuration Sample
Suppose the follow 301/302 redirect configuration for the domain name `cloud.tencent.com` is as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3b50b227455a42ef4f3244f426a6bfbd.png)
User A requests a resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`. If there were no cache hits in the node, the node will request it from the origin server. If the HTTP response status code returned by the origin server is 302, and the redirect address is `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, then:
1. As follow 301/302 redirect is enabled, the node will directly initiate a request to the redirect address when it receives the HTTP response with the 301/302 status code.
2. After getting the required resource, the node will cache it and return it to the user.
3. At this time, user B also sends a request for `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, which will result in a cache hit on the node and the resource will be returned to the user.
4. When follow 301/302 redirect is enabled, up to 3 follows are allowed. When the limit is exceeded, the 301/302 status code will be returned to the user.

Suppose the follow 301/302 redirect configuration for the domain name `cloud.tencent.com` is as follows:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/3d759a0270942d8852365ce89dac338e.png)
User A requests a resource `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`. If there were no cache hits in the node, the node will request it from the origin server. If the HTTP response status code returned by the origin server is 301/302, and the redirect address is `http://xxx.tencent.com/1.jpg`, then:
1. The node will return the HTTP response directly to the user.
2. When the user initiates a request for `http://xxx.tencent.com/1.jpg`, if the domain name is not connected to CDN, there will be no acceleration effect.
3. At this time, if user B also sends a request for `http://cloud.tencent.com/1.jpg`, the above process will be repeated.
