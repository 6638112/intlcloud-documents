This document describes how to accelerate access to resources in COS through CDN in the console.

## Prerequisites
1. You have signed up for a Tencent Cloud account and verified your identity.
2. You have activated the CDN service. For more information, please see [Getting started with CDN](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/32978).

## Operation Guide

### Creating a bucket
For more information on how to create a bucket, please see [Creating Buckets](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13309).

### Configuring the acceleration
1. After creating a bucket, enter its configuration management page directly. You can also click **Configuration Management** in the "Operation" column of the bucket in the bucket list to enter its configuration management page.

2. Enable the **default acceleration domain name**.
The **default acceleration domain name** is generated by the system and passes over CDN cache nodes. It can be enabled or disabled.
(1) Click **Edit** next to **Default Acceleration Domain Name** to manually enable or disable it on the default acceleration configuration page.

(2) Set the default acceleration configuration:

**Origin Server Type**: The **Default Origin Server** is generally used by default. If the bucket as an origin server enables a static website and you want to accelerate the static website, you can set the origin server type to **Static Website Origin Server**.
**Origin-Pull Authentication**: For public-read buckets, origin-pull authentication does not need to be enabled. For private-read buckets, CDN service authorization must be added and origin-pull authentication must be enabled manually. For more information, please see [Enabling origin-pull authentication](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/31505).
**CDN Service Authorization**: Click **Add CDN Service Authorization** to select and grant CDN access to resources in the bucket.

(3). After completing the configuration, click **Save** to activate CDN acceleration.

>For private-read buckets, after both origin-pull authentication and CDN service authorization are enabled, CDN does not need to carry a signature when accessing the origin server, and resources cached by CDN will be delivered over the public network, which may affect data security. We recommend you enable CDN authentication.
>
3. Enable **Custom Acceleration Domain Name**.
You can bind a custom domain name that already has an ICP filing to the bucket and enable CDN acceleration.
>A maximum of 10 custom domain names can be added in the COS console.
>
(1) Click **Create Distribution** in the **Custom Acceleration Domain Name** module to add a filed custom domain name.

(2) Set the following domain name configuration items:
- **Domain Name**: Enter the custom domain name to be bound (e.g., `www.example.com`). Ensure that the domain name entered has an ICP filing and a corresponding CNAME record has been configured with the DNS service provider. For more information, please see [CNAME Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/228/3121).
**Origin-Pull Authentication**: For private-read buckets, you can manually enable origin-pull authentication to protect your origin server.
After completing the configuration, click **Save**.

We recommend you enable CDN authentication.
>
(3) After the configuration is saved, CDN authentication switch will be displayed in the **CDN Authentication** column. You can manually enable CDN authentication for the custom domain name.
**CDN Authentication**: Timestamp-based authentication can be enabled to prevent malicious users from stealing your resources. You can configure this after adding the domain name.
