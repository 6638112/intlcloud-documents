## Overview

You can use the COS Console to copy single or multiple objects uploaded to the bucket from the source path to the destination path.

>Copy and paste is not supported for objects in the archive storage class.

## Directions

2. Click the name of the desired bucket such as `examplebucket-12500000000` to enter its file list page.

4. After the system prompts that the copy is successful, you can paste them to the destination path, such as the `target` folder in the `examplebucket1-1250000000` bucket.

>The destination path cannot be the same as the source path; otherwise, the paste will fail.
5. After successful paste, you can see that the objects or folders have been copied to the `target` folder.
