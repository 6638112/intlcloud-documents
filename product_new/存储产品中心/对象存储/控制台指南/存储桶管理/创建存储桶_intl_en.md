3. In the **Create Bucket** dialog box, configure the information as follows:
 - **Name**: Enter a custom bucket name, which is non-modifiable once being configured. For information on naming, see [Naming Conventions](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13312#.E5.91.BD.E5.90.8D.E8.A7.84.E8.8C.83).

 - **Access Permission**: Three access permissions for buckets are available by default: "Private Read/Write", "Public Read/Private Write" and "Public Read/Write". The permission can still be modified after configuration. For more information, see [Bucket Access Permissions](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/13315).
 - **Bucket Tag**: Bucket tags are used to identify and group buckets for an easier management. For more information, see [Setting Bucket Tags](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/34830).
