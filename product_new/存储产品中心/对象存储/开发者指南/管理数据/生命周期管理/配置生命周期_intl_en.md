## Use Cases

With lifecycle configuration, certain predefined actions can be automatically performed when a rule is applied to objects. For example:

- Transition: Transitions objects to the STANDARD_IA, INTELLIGENT_TIERING, ARCHIVE, or DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class after a specified period.
- Expiration: Deletes objects after their specified expiration time.
