COS standard storage users can enjoy the following free quotas:

| User Type | Free Quota | Validity Period |
| -------- | :---------------- | ------ |
| Individual user | 50 GB of standard storage capacity | 6 months |
| Enterprise user | 1 TB of standard storage capacity | 6 months |

>1. COS fees include **storage capacity fees**, **request fees**, **data retrieval fees** and **traffic fees**. The free quotas list above are only applicable to the standard storage capacity fees, and other types of fees are charged nonetheless. For more information on COS billing, see [Billing Descriptions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/16871).
> 2. At the time of bill settlement, the system will settle in the order of **free quota > resource package > pay-as-you-go billing**.
>    - By default, the system uses the pay-as-you-go billing method for bill settlement, i.e., the system will deduct the free quota first and then bill the excessive usage (if any) in a **pay-as-you-go** manner.
>    - If you have purchased a resource package, during the validity period of the package, the system will deduct the free quota and resource package first and then bill the excessive usage (if any) in a **pay-as-you-go** manner.
> 3. The free quota will be delivered to your account in the form of a resource package after you activate COS. You can view the effective time and expiration time of the free quota resource package on the **Resource Package Management** page in the console.
> 4. **Free quota** is valid for 6 calendar months after you activate COS.
> > For example, if you activate COS at 17:13:14 on February 10, 2019, then the free quota will be valid between February 1, 2019, 00:00:00 and July 31, 2019, 23:59:59.
> 5. If you are already charged at a discounted price, the discounted price will prevail with no free quota available.
> 6. If your service is interrupted due to violations or arrears, you cannot continue to enjoy the free quota. The free quota can be enjoyed again only after the service is resumed.
> 7. The free quotas are only applicable to public cloud regions. For more information, see [Regions and Access Domain Names](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/436/6224).
