
## Overview
This document provides sample code for integrating with the SDK and launching TPNS. (SDK version: v1.0+)

## SDK Composition
- doc folder: TPNS SDK for iOS development guide.
- demo folder: it mainly contains demo projects and TPNS SDK (only the OC demo is included. For the Swift demo, please go to [TGit](https://git.code.tencent.com/tpns/XG-Demo-Swift)). 



## Integration Steps
1. Log in to the [TPNS Console](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns) and click **Product Management** on the left sidebar.
2. Go to the **Product Management** page and click **Add Product**.
3. Go to the **Add a Product** page, and enter the product name and product details. Select the product type, and click **OK** to add a new product.
4. After the product is created, select **Configuration Management** on the left sidebar. Get `Access ID` and `SECRET KEY` from the "Application Info" column.
5. Import SDK:
 - **Method one: import using Cocoapods**
Download through Cocoapods:
``` 
 pod 'TPNS-iOS' 
```
 >
    - For the first download, you need to log in to the [git address](https://git.code.tencent.com/users/sign_in) to set the account and password in **Account** and then enter the corresponding account and password in Terminal. Subsequently, no login is required on the current PC.
    - Due to the change of the git address, if the pod prompts `Unable to find a specification for 'TPNS-iOS'`, you need to run the following command to update the git and confirm the version:
``` 
pod repo update
pod search TPNS-iOS
pod install // Install the SDK 
```

 - **Method two: import using carthage**
 Specify the dependent third-party libraries in the Cartfile file:
```
 github "xingePush/carthage-TPNS-iOS"
```

 - **Method three: manual import**
Enter the TPNS Console and click **[SDK Download](https://console.cloud.tencent.com/tpns/sdkdownload)** on the left sidebar to go to the download page. Select the SDK version to download, and click **Download** in the **Operations** column.

6. Open the SDK folder under the demo directory. Add `XGPush.h` and `libXG-SDK-Cloud.a` to the project. Open the `XGPushStatistics` folder, and get `XGMTACloud.framework`.
7. Add the following frameworks to Build Phases:
```
 * XGMTACloud.framework
 * CoreTelephony.framework
 * SystemConfiguration.framework
 * UserNotifications.framework
 * libXG-SDK-Cloud.a 
 * libz.tbd
 * CoreData.framework
 * CFNetwork.framework
 * libc++.tbd
```
8. After adding the frameworks, the library references are as follows:

9. Open the push notification in the project configuration and backend modes, as shown in the following figure:
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/549acb8c1cf61c1d2f41de4762baf47b.png)
10. Add the compilation parameter `-ObjC` .
![](https://main.qcloudimg.com/raw/b0b74cec883f69fb0287fedc7bad4140.png)

>If checkTargetOtherLinkFlagForObjc reports an error, it means -ObjC has not been added to Other link flags in build setting.

11. Call the API for launching TPNS and implement the method in the `XGPushDelegate` protocol as needed to launch the push service.
	1. Launch TPNS. The `AppDelegate` sample is as follows:
   ```Objective-C
@interface AppDelegate () <XGPushDelegate>
@end 
/**
@param appID  `AccessID` applied for in the TPNS Console
@param appKey   `AccessKey` applied for in the TPNS Console
@param delegate   Callback object
**/
-(BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions 
{
[[XGPush defaultManager] startXGWithAppID:<#your appID#> appKey:<#your appKey#>  delegate:<#your delegate#>];
return YES;
}
   ```
	2. In `AppDelegate`, choose to implement the method in the `XGPushDelegate` protocol:
		```objective-c
		/// Unified callback for message receipt
		/// @param notification   Message object
		/// @param completionHandler   Completion callback
		/// Message type description: if `msgtype` in the `xg` field is 1, it means notification message; if `msgtype` is 2, it means silent message
		/// notification message object description: there are two types: `NSDictionary` and `UNNotification`. For detailed interpretations, please see the sample code
		- (void)xgPushDidReceiveRemoteNotification:(nonnull id)notification withCompletionHandler:(nullable void (^)(NSUInteger))completionHandler{
		/// code
		} 
		#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= __IPHONE_10_0
		/// iOS 10 new API
		/// iOS 10 will use the new API, while iOS 10 or below will sue the legacy API
		/// Application user clicks a notification and selects a behavior in the notification
		/// This callback will be used in both local push and remote push
		- (void)xgPushUserNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
	  didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
	           withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler {
	                                                     /// code
	}
	#endif
			 ```




#### Integrating services outside Mainland China
1. Decompress the SDK file package and add the `XGPushPrivate.h` file in the SDK directory to the project.
2. Call the configuration `HOST` API in the header file:
 - To integrate with a cluster in Singapore, set `HOST` to `https://api.tpns.sgp.tencent.com` and `PORT` to 0.
 - To integrate with a cluster in Hong Kong (China), set `HOST` to `https://api.tpns.hk.tencent.com` and `PORT` to 0.

**Sample**
``` object-c
[[XGPush defaultManager] configureHost:@"https://api.tpns.hk.tencent.com" port:0]
```
>The `HOST` configuring API should be called before the `startXGWithAppID` method.




## Debugging Method
#### Enabling debug mode
Enable debug mode to view detailed TPNS debug information in the end terminal, facilitating fault location.

#### Sample code
```
// This is to enable debugging
[[XGPush defaultManager] setEnableDebug:YES];
```



#### Implementing `XGPushDelegate` protocol

During debugging, it is recommended that you implement this method in the protocol to get detailed debugging information.

```objective-c
/**
 @brief This registers the callback of the push service
 @param deviceToken   `Device Token` generated by APNs
 @param xgToken   `Token` generated by TPNS, which needs to be used when pushing messages. TPNS maintains the mapping relationship between this value and the `Device Token` of APNs
 @param error   Error message. If `error` is `nil`, the push service has been successfully registered
 */
- (void)xgPushDidRegisteredDeviceToken:(nullable NSString *)deviceToken xgToken:(nullable NSString *)xgToken error:(nullable NSError *)error;
```

#### Observing log
If Xcode console displays a log similar to the one below, the client has properly integrated the SDK.

```javascript
[TPNS] Current device token is 9298da5605c3b242261b57****376e409f826c2caf87aa0e6112f944
[TPNS] Current TPNS token is 00c30e0aeddff1270d8****dc594606dc184  
```
>Use a XG 36-bit token for pushing to a single target device.

## Unified Message Receipt and Message Click Callback Description

- If the message is clicked on devices above iOS 10.0, this function will be invoked:
```objective-c
	- (void)xgPushUserNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler;
```
- If the message is clicked on devices below iOS 10.0, this function will be invoked:
```objective-c
	- (void)xgPushDidReceiveRemoteNotification:(nonnull id)notification withCompletionHandler:(nullable void (^)(NSUInteger))completionHandler;
```

- If a silent message is received, this function will be called:
```objective-c
	- (void)xgPushDidReceiveRemoteNotification:(nonnull id)notification withCompletionHandler:(nullable void (^)(NSUInteger))completionHandler;
```

>The `xgPushDidReceiveRemoteNotification` will be used to receive message callback regardless of whether the message is clicked or not in the application in the foreground

## Unregistering XG Platform Service

If the application push service is migrated from the XG platform (https://xg.qq.com) to the TPNS platform, you need to call the API of `TPNS SDK(1.2.5.3+)` to unregister the device information on the XG platform.

#### API

```objective-c
// TPNS `accessId` (TPNS SDK v2 and v3 supported)
@property uint32_t freeAccessId;
```

#### Usage

- Import the header file `XGForFreeVersion.h` 
- Call this API before `startXGWithAppID:appKey:delegate:`. See the sample below:

```objective-c
[XGForFreeVersion defaultForFreeVersion].freeAccessId = 2200262432;
[[XGPush defaultManager] startXGWithAppID: <#your tpns access ID#>appKey:<#your tpns access key#> delegate:<#your delegate#>];
```
>If the above configuration is not completed, duplicate messages may appear when pushing on both the XG and TPNS platforms at the same time.

## Suggestions on Integration
#### Notification service extension feature (required)
To implement the features of arriving data reporting and rich media messaging, the SDK provides the Service ExtensionÂ API, which can be called by the client to listen to the arrival of messages and send rich media messages. You are strongly recommended to implement this API. For API integration guide, please see [Notification Service Extension Usage Instructions](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/30730).
>If this API is not integrated, the `number of arriving messages` and `number of clicks` in the statistics will be the same.

<span id="QHToken"></span>
#### Getting token (optional)
It is recommended that after you integrate the SDK, you use gestures or other methods to display the token in the application's less commonly used UI such as **About** or **Feedback**. Doing so will facilitate subsequent troubleshooting.

#### Sample code
```objective-c
// Get the token generated by TPNS
[[XGPushTokenManager defaultTokenManager] xgTokenString];
// Get the `DeviceToken` generated by APNs
[[XGPushTokenManager defaultTokenManager] deviceTokenString];
```
