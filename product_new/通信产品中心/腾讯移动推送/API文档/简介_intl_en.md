RESTful APIs are HTTP management APIs that provide the application backend with a management entry at the backend for you to remotely call the push service.

RESTful APIs support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. For the sake of security, the HTTPS protocol is recommended.

## Prerequisites
Before you call a RESTful API, make sure that you have created the application in the TPNS Console. For more information, please see [Creating Products and Applications](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1024/32603).
