
## TIMLogin

This API is used to log in to the Tencent backend server.

**Prototype**

```c
TIM_DECL int TIMLogin(const char* user_id, const char* user_sig, TIMCommCallback cb, const void* user_data);
```

**Parameters**

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----|-----|-----|
| user_id | const char\* | UserID of a user. |
| user_sig | const char\* | UserSig of a user. |
| cb | TIMCommCallback | Callback function for notifying whether login was successful. For more information about the callback function definition, see [TIMCommCallback](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34550). |
| user_data | const void\* | User-defined data. The IM SDK only transfers the user data to the callback function cb without processing the data. |

**Return values**

| Type | Description |
|-----|-----|
| int | If TIM_SUCC is returned, the API was successfully called. (The callback cb is called only when the API returns TIM_SUCC.) If other values are returned, the API failed to be called. For more information about the definition of each return value, see [TIMResult](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34551). |
