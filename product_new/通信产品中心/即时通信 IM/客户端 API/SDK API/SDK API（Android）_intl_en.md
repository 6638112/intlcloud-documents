## TIMManager

As a core module of the IM SDK, TIMManager works for initialization, login, conversation creation, and push management of the IM SDK.
- Initialization: the prerequisite for using the IM SDK. You need to call the init API first before calling other APIs.
- Login: you need to configure the SDKAppID, UserID, and UserSig before using IM.
- Conversation: each time you start a conversation, you open a conversation window. A conversation can be a C2C chat or a group chat.
- Push: you can configure and manage features related to offline push, including tokens and feature enabling/disabling.
