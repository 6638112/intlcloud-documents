## Step 2: Integrate the SDK
TUIKit is a UI component layer that encapsulates the IM SDK and contains common IM operations, such as the chat panel, conversation list, and contacts.
- To quickly integrate and use the SDK, see [Quick SDK Integration (Including UI Library)] (https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/37059).
- To use SDK APIs to customize UIs, see [Normal SDK Integration (Without the UI Library)](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/9227).

## Step 3: Integrate RESTful APIs for the Server End
The IM service provides server-end RESTful APIs for the app service backend to manage server-end services, such as IM service user accounts, one-to-one chat messages, group chat messages, group management, user profiles, friend relationship links, operational data, historical message download, and third-party callback.
For details on the server integration operation, see [Server-End API Documentation](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/1520).

## Step 4: (Optional) Integrate the Video Chat Service
The IM service can quickly integrate [real-time audio and video TRTC services](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/647/17021) to provide services such as user video chat and group video conferencing in IM applications. Currently, only iOS supports this feature.
For details on the integration operation, see [Integrating Video Chat](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/269/39167).
