## Feature Description

This API is used by the app backend to monitor a userâ€™s one-to-one chat messages in real time, including:
- Records one-to-one chat messages in real time, for example, by recording a log or synchronizing the messages to other systems.
- Collects statistics on one-to-one chat messages, for example, in terms of the number of users or the number of messages.

## Notes

- To enable this callback, you must configure the callback URL and enable the corresponding protocol for this callback. For more information on the configuration method, see [Third-Party Callback Configuration](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34520).
- During this callback, the IM backend initiates an HTTPS POST request to the app backend.
- After receiving the callback request, the app backend must check whether the SDKAppID contained in the request URL is the SDKAppID of the app.
- If the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages and the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages are both enabled and muting is returned for the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages, the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages cannot be triggered.
- If the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages and the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages are both enabled and the message body is modified during the callback before sending one-to-one chat messages, the callback after sending one-to-one chat messages will use the modified message for callback.
- For more security considerations, see [Third-Party Callback Overview: Security Considerations](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354).

## Callback Trigger Scenarios

- An app user sends a one-to-one chat message on the client.
- The app admin sends a one-to-one chat message by calling the RESTful SendMsg API.

## Callback Trigger Conditions

The IM backend receives a one-to-one chat message sent by a user and delivers the message to the target user.

> If the IM backend fails to deliver the message, for example, due to obscene word filtering, the callback is still triggered.

## API Call Description

### Sample request URL

In the following example, the callback URL configured in the app is `https://www.example.com`.
**Example:**

```
https://www.example.com?SdkAppid=$SDKAppID&CallbackCommand=$CallbackCommand&contenttype=json&ClientIP=$ClientIP&OptPlatform=$OptPlatform
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| https | Specifies that the request protocol is HTTPS and the request method is POST. |
| www.example.com | The callback URL. |
| SdkAppid | The SDKAppID assigned via the IM console when the application is created. |
| CallbackCommand | The value is fixed to C2C.CallbackAfterSendMsg. |
| contenttype | The value is fixedly set to JSON. |
| ClientIP | The IP address of the client, such as 127.0.0.1. |
| OptPlatform | The platform of the client. For more information on the value, see the parameter description of the OptPlatform in [Third-Party Callback Overview: Callback Protocols](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34354). |

### Sample request packets

```

    "MsgKey": "48374_2837546_1557481126", // The unique identifier of the message. It is used by RESTful APIs to recall a one-to-one chat message.
	"SendMsgResult": 0, //The result of sending the message
    "ErrorInfo": "send msg succeed", //The error information describing the message failed to be sent. If the message is sent successfully, it shows "send msg succeed"
    "MsgBody": [ // The body of the message.
        {
            "MsgType": "TIMTextElem", // The text of the message.
            "MsgContent": {}
                "Text": "red packet"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
