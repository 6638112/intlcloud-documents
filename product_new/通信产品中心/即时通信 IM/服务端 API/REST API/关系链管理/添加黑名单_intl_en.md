## API Description

This API is used to add one or multiple people to your blocklist.
>!
>- If users A and B are friends, either one adding the other to the blocklist removes them from each other’s friend list.
> If user A blocks user B, or vice versa, then neither of them can send a friend request to the other person.
>- If user B is on user A’s blocklist and user A is also on user B’s blocklist, then user A and B cannot start a conversation with each other.
-> If user B is on user A’s blocklist, but user A is not on user B’s blocklist, then user A can message user B but not the other way around.
