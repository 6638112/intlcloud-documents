## Feature Description
- This API is used by the app admin to query the history of a one-to-one chat based on a specified time range.
- The one-to-one chat to be queried is specified by From_Account and to_Account in the request. The query result contains the messages sent between both sides. The specific sender and recipient of each message are specified by From_Account and to_Account, respectively.
- In most cases, if you exchange the values of From_Account and to_Account in the request, the query result will remain unchanged. However, to query a message sent via [Sending a One-to-One Chat Message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) or [Batch sending One-to-One Chat Messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34920), if you set SyncOtherMachine to 1, you must specify From_Account and to_Account correctly.
  For example, assume that you have called [Sending a One-to-One Chat Message](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/34919) to enable account A to send a message to account B and set SyncOtherMachine to 1. When calling this API to query the message history of the one-to-one chat, you must set From_Account to account A and to_Account to account B.
- The query result contains recalled messages indicated by the MsgFlagBits field.
- If you want to recall a message by calling the RESTful API for [recalling one-to-one chat messages](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/35015), you can first call this API to query the MsgKey of the message and then call the recall API to recall the message.
- The time range of message records that can be queried depends on the roaming message storage period, which is 7 days by default. You can modify the message roaming period through the IM console. Extending the message roaming period is a value-added service. For more information, see [Roaming Message Storage](https://intl.cloud.tencent.com/document/product/1047/33524).
- For first-time queries, we recommend that you set MaxCnt to 20. In the response, the Complete field indicates whether all messages within the time range have been pulled.

For example, assume that 2 messages were sent between user1 and user2 within the time range from 2020-03-20 10:00:00 to 2020-03-20 11:00:00 and we want to query the chat history that was generated within this time range.

#### Sample request packet
```
{
    "From_Account":"user2",
    "To_Account":"user1",
    "MaxCnt":2,
    "MinTime":1584669600,
    "MaxTime":1584673200
}
```
##### Sample response packet
```
{
    "ActionStatus":"OK",
    "ErrorInfo":"",
    "ErrorCode": 0
    "Complete": 1,
    "MsgCnt": 2,
    "LastMsgTime": 1584669680,
    "LastMsgKey": "549396494_2578554_1584669680",
    "MsgList": [
        {
            "From_Account": "user1",
            "To_Account": "user2",
            "MsgSeq": 549396494,
            "MsgRandom": 2578554,
            "MsgTimeStamp": 1584669680,
            "MsgFlagBits": 0,
            "MsgKey": "549396494_2578554_1584669680",
            "MsgBody": [
                {
                    "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",
                    "MsgContent": {}
                        "Text": "1"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "From_Account": "user2",
            "To_Account": "user1",

            "MsgTimeStamp": 1584669689,
            "MsgFlagBits": 0,
            "MsgKey": "1054803289_7201_1584669689",
            "MsgBody": [
                {
                    "MsgType": "TIMTextElem",
                    "MsgContent": {}
                        "Text": "2"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Return all data through multiple requests (continued pulling is required)
For example, assume that 100 messages were sent between user1 and user2 within the time range from 2020-03-20 10:00:00 to 2020-03-20 11:00:00 and we want to query the chat history that was generated within this time range.
##### Sample of the first request packet
```
{
    "From_Account":"user2",
    "To_Account":"user1",
    "MaxCnt":100,
    "MinTime":1584669600,
    "MaxTime":1584673200
}
```

##### Sample response packet
```
{
    "ActionStatus":"OK",
    "ErrorInfo":"",
    "ErrorCode": 0
    "Complete": 0,
    "MsgCnt": 17,
    "LastMsgTime": 1584672269,
    "LastMsgKey": "1259_93754093_1584672269",
    "MsgList": [ ... ] //To indicate a continued pulling process, the result of MsgList is not listed.
}
```

In the response, `"Complete": 0` indicates that not all messages generated within the time range have been pulled. Therefore, continued pulling is required.
In the continued pulling request, the value of MaxTime must be changed to the value of the LastMsgTime field in the response, and the LastMsgKey field in the response must be specified, as shown below:

<span id="example"></span>
##### Continued pulling request
```
{
    "From_Account":"user2",
    "To_Account":"user1",
    "MaxCnt":100,
    "MinTime":1584669600,
    "MaxTime":1584672269,
    "LastMsgKey": "1259_93754093_1584672269"
}
```
