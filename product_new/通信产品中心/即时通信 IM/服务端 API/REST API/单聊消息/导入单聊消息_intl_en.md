## API Description
- This API imports one-to-one chat history to IM.
- It can import your messages from other instant messaging platforms to Tencent Cloud IM.
- This API does not trigger a callback.
- This API deduplicates the imported messages based on the `From_Account`, `To_Account`, `MsgRandom`, and `MsgTimeStamp` fields. **When the values of all the four fields match their counterparts, the two messages are considered duplicates, regardless of their contents.**
- Imported messages will not be overwritten by the same message from later imports.
