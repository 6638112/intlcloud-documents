## Feature Description
This API is used to import app-owned accounts to IM in batches and create internal IDs for these accounts. In this way, these accounts can use the IM service even if they have never been used to log in to IM before.
For example, if user A has never logged in to IM, an app developer cannot use this RESTful API to send a message to user A because no internal ID for user A is found. The message can be successfully sent only after user Aâ€™s account is imported to IM and the system creates an internal ID for user A.

> This API can import up to 100 accounts to IM at a time. If an account is imported repeatedly, only one internal ID will be created for it.
