## Feature Description
This API is used to batch import app-owned accounts to IM to create internal IDs for these accounts. In this way, these accounts can use the IM service even if they have never logged in to IM before.
For example, if an app developer uses this RESTful API to send a message to user A who has never logged in to IM, the message cannot be sent because no internal ID for user A is found. In this case, the app developer needs to import user A’s account into IM to enable the system to create an internal ID for user A. Then, the app developer can use this RESTful API to send messages to user A.

> This API can import up to 100 accounts to IM at a time. If an account is imported repeatedly, only one internal ID will be created for it.
