## Feature Description
This API is used to import an app-owned account to IM and create an internal ID for the account in IM. In this way, the account can use the IM service even if it has never been used to log in to IM before.
For example, if user A has never logged in to IM, an app developer cannot use this RESTful API to send a message to user A because no internal ID for user A is found. The message can be successfully sent only after user A’s account is imported to IM and the system creates an internal ID for user A.

> If an account is imported repeatedly, only one internal ID will be created for it.
